What's distroying the nature are, all those  agricultrural tycoons use insect killers which kills all bees and other insects who cross breed plant, distroying the forests for lamber use etc, the acual polution is mankind distroying the earth, then tycoons come up with the global warming.

"Don Kloos","2023-02-14T13:56:33Z","CO2 absorption of  terrestrial IR occurs at 15um wavelenth and follows ""Beers Law"" - college chemistry basics. The absorption is maximized, 99.9%, in under 10m from the earth's surface at CO2 concentration of just 200ppm or less.  Increasing CO2 does not increase absorption further, so there is no increase in IR energy absorption from the earth's surface with CO2 doubling. This is basic college chemistry and physics of the issue. The truth is that CO2 increase does not further add to the greenhouse effect  than it already does. There is a great series of short 4min lectures on YouTube about the details by Michel van Biezen."

Also, note that the Florida Keys and the Maldives are mostly coral and coral forms ONLY underwater.  Experts tell us the Saraha was green only 6,000 years ago and most of Florida was under water countless times.  Conclusion?  Climate change always has and always will.  I have no reason to conclude this present moment is the optimum for flora or fauna. I am far more concerned about vulcanism or an asteroid strike."

"Christopher Detter","2023-01-31T01:30:09Z","I see no doubt that climate change is real and very little doubt that it is associated human activity. As I set my thermostat, it dawned on me that I don't know if the obvious contribution of building heat has been considered, and how it compares to the effect of greenhouse gases like CO2. The contribution of building heat is obviously huge (think of the forests of skyscrapers in large cities), and its steep contribution would correspond to the turn of the 19th century (as would the greenhouse effect). Building heat contribution is obviously NOT an essentially thermodynamically--neutral phenomenon like air conditioning. The need to heat indoors in winter exists in huge swaths of landed areas, mostly in the northern hemisphere. Insulation slows the rate of heat dissipation and reduces the total amount of heat needed, but it does not eliminate heat loss entirely. I'm not an expert and may have missed coverage of this aspect of climate change, but nowhere have I heard of any scientific investigation comparing heat added by greenhouse gas effects vs heat added by the sum of all indoor space heating - a heretofore glaring oversight. Even if we manage to eliminate all artificial discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere, would we really slow down climate change? By how much? Would it be better to invest money in better insulation systems?"

We by causing global warming make the earth warming but the earth will self control itself by making it colder. It eventually become too much and the earth like a earthquake will make it extremely cold aka ice age. That‚Äôs why people say its not real bc they think the world will turn warmer when in reality its turning colder because it‚Äôs turning warmer. Another thing is water or anything warm in general turns cold over time so what do you think all that warm energy turns into? More warm energy? Theoretically you would assume it makes it endlessly stay warm like adding wood to a fire or leaving a stove on but since the world has nights the coldness of the night might help cool it too making some of the warm energy turn to cool energy."

Accepting climate change is real means ending the illusion of the rugged individual, and recognizing the need for collective action and that's too horrific for them to even entertain, so they act like Sartre's anti-semite. Sartre: Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past."

The alarmists seem to think if we could only get that number down to .0003% it would somehow change the climate.

"crispy336","2022-12-01T22:18:17Z","More climate fearporn. We have had cyclical weather differences since before records began. In Roman Britain there were vineyards in the north of England and the climate was much warmer and according to the BBC website.  Sub-zero temperatures saw water turn to ice along a section of the Thames in Teddington, in the south west of England's capital city. 
An image taken by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in Teddington showed seagulls chilling on the frozen surface of the river.
In a tweet, the RNLI said they might've needed to use a smaller lifeboat as an 'icebraker' to get out onto the water because it's ""not often the Thames freezes over in Teddington"".
A spokesperson said ""It's quite spectacular. I've lived here for 13-years and I've not seen this part of the river freeze like this."" What about the hole in the ozone layer or in the 1970's we were told there was only 10 years of petrol left on the planet. It's another climate non crisis like the CO2 alarmism that is designed to create another scare and hope you will comply to whatever the government demands of your freedoms. Of course the banking system will benefit from the carbon taxes that will further impoverish you and again make you more subdued and beholding to the government. They will use this alleged emergency to compel you to stop using your cars as they jet around the world in their luxury yachts and planes."

You‚Äôre now saying London was ‚Äònear the coast‚Äô during Roman occupation - where before you were saying the sea was ‚Äòwhere London is today‚Äô.   Maybe (once you decide which) you would give some source/s for this contrarian/new historical information that you‚Äôre claiming?

You still haven‚Äôt answered my question - why do historians tell us that London was ‚Äòa Roman port on the river with the bridge across it‚Äô? 

‚ÄúThe main port of Londinium was situated along the north bank of the river where wharves and warehouses were constructed. The Roman bridge over the river, built in 85-90AD, seems to have been in the same location as its medieval successor, that is with its northern end in line with Fish Street Hill, and was built of timber. It probably acted as a barrier past which only the smallest boats could pass, so coastal and sea-going ships loaded and unloaded immediately downstream of it.‚Äù - From webpage The Port of Roman London at thehistoryoflondon (UK)"
"yarrw","2022-12-09T10:01:40Z","@Peter Piper  ‚Ä¢  32 years ago Due to the great Krakatoa world wide volcanic disaster of 535 AD there was a 2 yr winter and it was also increased SO2 sulfur in the atmosphere and a mini ice age followed in the 1600's (maunder minimum) so sea level dropped by about a meter caused droughts and we could say it was climate change.  The reason Romans built Londinium near the coast is it was difficult to navigate a sailing ship in a river."
"Peter Piper  ‚Ä¢  32 years ago","2022-12-08T20:16:16Z","‚Äú2000 years ago they grow grapes in England and sea levels where London is today‚Äù
So how come history tells us London was a Roman port on a river with a bridge across it? ‚ÄúThe Romans invaded Britain in AD43 and landed in Kent. Pursuing the ancient Britons along the banks of the Thames, they came to the first fordable point of the river. On a site nearby they built a garrison and Londinium was born. Later they erected the first bridge over the Thames. Built entirely in wood it stood a little downstream of where the current London Bridge is.

After the Roman withdrawal from Britain, London and its bridge suffered from neglect and was also damaged by Viking raiders who came to plunder the wealth London had gained as a major trading post. It was not until 886 when Alfred the Great finally drove the invaders out that London fully recovered and moved into a golden age as trade under the Anglo-Saxons increased. The bridge was repaired and the City and its citizens prospered.‚Äù

In fact they are increasing emissions when the rest of the world are in the process of decreasing emissions. 

China Has Built 14 Overseas Coal Plants Since Vowing No New Ones!

China is Currently Building Over Half of The World's New Coal-based Power Plants.

The Udangudi plant is one of nearly 200 coal-fired power stations under construction in Asia, including 95 in China, 28 in India and 23 in Indonesia, according to data from U.S. nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

China, for example, generates around 30% of all global emissions, while the United States is responsible for almost 14% yet has four times less people than China.  So you seem to be expecting the Chinese to emit less than half the CO2 as the US, per capita?  Why is that?

"Phil","2022-11-26T14:09:04Z","Climate change is part of metaphysics. 
It's logical that Human influence has had some effect on weather. Based on actual evidence of life flourishing at far higher temperatures my question would be ""so what""? 
Rather than biased catastrophization of human influence, it might be suggested that, based on an objective risk/benefit analysis, as a species we should be grateful that fossil fuels are available and should be used more to negate the un-benevolent reality of what life on earth would be like without them. People who don't understand or at least acknowledge that have already lost the argument. 
Just because the ""UN"" have redefined the words Climate Change to suit the narrative of certain individuals doesn't make that version real."

It is an irrefutable fact that as CO2 levels increase then plant growth does also. 
CO2 at 1000ppm [ three times present levels] is possibly optimum for forests, agriculture, and deserts..
Commercial green houses use this fact for high yield and profitability
 If we could increase levels of CO2 to optimum levels of about 1000ppm  the forests would flourish; the deserts would become productive; and the imminent destruction of agriculture now sought would make New Zealand even a greater major exporter of food ; 
plentiful for the world,. 
And of course human societies go well during the warm periods. 
Older people flock to warmer areas at retirement. 
The climate threat is a globalist scam to redistribute wealth upwards yet again.
  CO2 levels rise  after warm earth periods not before as  we are conditioned to think by the fraudulent climate control  freaks. 
 In any event human civilizations have always  been more successful in warmer periods.

The animals give off methane gas which is 80 times more heating to the planet than carbon dioxide. We need to stop eating meat and let the numbers of animals decrease right down (which they will - they are only so high now because they have been forcefully bred into existence). This would free up land which would re-wild back to forest to absorb the heating gases and water and give space for wild animals to live and thus balance out the eco-systems. Animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of global warming when you factor in the forest cleared to accommodate grazing livestock. We don't need meat to thrive. Its a palate addiction and a cultural thing. Watch The Game Changers, Food Inc, Cowspiracy etc. Lets think and shift over to plant-based. (25 years wholefoods-plant-based and very healthy person here). For anyone who knows the truth about reincarnation, don't think you will escape this earth never to return when you die and so you are okay, it won't be too bad in your lifetime - anyone who hasn't attained Divinity will be reborn here is some form or other and have to suffer the overheated future earth.

Their papers showed that the growing amount of greenhouse gasses that humans were putting into the atmosphere would cause much greater warming ‚Äì warming that would exert a much greater influence on global temperature than any possible natural or human-caused cooling effects.

By 1980 the predictions about ice ages had ceased, due to the overwhelming evidence contained in an increasing number of reports that warned of global warming. Unfortunately, the small number of predictions of an ice age appeared to be much more interesting than those of global warming, so it was those sensational 'Ice Age' stories in the press that so many people tend to remember.  The fact is that around 1970 there were 6 times as many scientists predicting a warming rather than a cooling planet. Today, with 30+years more data to analyse, we've reached a clear scientific consensus: over 99% of scientists agree.  There is as much disagreement about anthropogenic global warming as there is about evolution or plate tectonics - ie zero.  It‚Äôs happening."

"TheRealJukebox","2022-10-22T06:02:58Z","A GREAT POST ABOUT NASA AND THE GLOBAL WARMING NONSENSE!

(Natural News) For more than 60 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has known that the changes occurring to planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. But the space agency, for whatever reason, has chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread, to the detriment of human freedom.

It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth‚Äôs axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as ‚Äúwarming‚Äù (or ‚Äúcooling,‚Äù depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words.

But NASA has thus far failed to set the record straight, and has instead chosen to sit silently back and watch as liberals freak out about the world supposedly ending in 12 years because of too much livestock, or too many plastic straws.

In the year 2000, NASA did publish information on its Earth Observatory website about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, revealing that the planet is, in fact, changing due to extraneous factors that have absolutely nothing to do with human activity. But, again, this information has yet to go mainstream, some 19 years later, which is why deranged, climate-obsessed leftists have now begun to claim that we really only have 18 months left before the planet dies from an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2).

The truth, however, is much more along the lines of what Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, after whom the Milankovitch Climate Theory is named, proposed about how the seasonal and latitudinal variations of solar radiation that hit the earth in different ways, and at different times, have the greatest impact on earth‚Äôs changing climate patterns.
YET! GOVERNMENTS ARE ‚ÄúSTILL‚Äù COMMITTING FRAUD BY STEALING MONEY FROM THEIR CITIZENS IN THE FORM OF ANTI CO2/CARBON TAX!"
"Curtis Webber","2022-10-20T14:33:28Z","Why do they never mention the Milankovitch Cycles every 100,000 years the planet warms and cools and we are not as high as past warm peaks, especially the last peak they know the temperature is supposed to increase according to the Milankovitch Cycles. They are scaring you for the money. Science gets large grants and those who debunk get nothing. Politicians get a kickback and invest in green that they are pushing. 

interesting fact:  outside in the open air co2 levels are 400 ppm however inside a classroom full of students co2 is as high as 1700 ppm in a submarine full of people 5000 parts ppm in a spacecraft with people 7000 ppm. 
interesting fact: plants stop growing when co2 levels are at 150 ppm pre-industrial revolution co2 was 280 ppm today 400 ppm plants thrive at 1000 - 2000 ppm and require very little water which is what plants prefer.
interesting fact: 100 to 500 million years ago co2 level was 1k to 7k ppm and the earth was just fine this would be when plant life was at level 100x it is today and the largest animals thrived as the dinosaurs existed, and the temperature was very stapled no winter just a constant steady warm climate."

"Eaton Kuntz","2022-10-19T18:52:47Z","Every climate change model has been wrong. They don't look far enough back in history to see that CO2 and temperature have never been correlated. Temperature changes are definitely connected to solar cycles and volcanic activity.

Also, we're well below the normal CO2 levels that has nurtured life for hundreds of millions of years. 1000 - 4000ppm is normal. We're freaking out because we went from 280 to 413ppm. Several eras including the Phanerozoic had 5000 - 6000ppm and there's zero evidence of the oceans boiling off or any other runaway greenhouse catastrophes. A few degrees warmer, no ice caps, more life and vegetation, and a more stable climate across the entire globe.

Burning all the fossil fuels available wouldn't even bring us close to that, because so much of the stored carbon is financially impractical to extract.

Also, global sea level averages have only changed by millimeters a year in the modern era. Local changes are very normal. People don't understand basic planetary physics and climate change activists take advantage of that to take your attention from real issues like wars, poverty, social decline, etc. Please don't fall for this, do the hard research that google won't tell you."

If the U.S. invested in there three projects it would take about 10 years to build (and that is assuming we can cut as much red tape as possible to start right away.

A person whose house is lost to sea level rise in Australia has a social safety net, despite being a member of a nation with the highest per capital carbon production.  That's inequality between nations.  But when the top 10% of the worlds population holds 90% of the worlds wealth and uses its political clout to keep its grip on the resources then the problems within nations become clearer.  Much mitigation activity is stemmied by this obscene fact.  And much of the delay in action has been fueled by the fossil fuel billion companies.

CO2 at 1000ppm [ three times present levels] is possibly optimum for forests, agriculture, and deserts..
Commercial green houses use this fact for high yield and profitability
 If we could increase levels of CO2 to optimum levels of about 1000ppm  the forests would flourish; the deserts would become productive; and the imminent destruction of agriculture now sought would make New Zealand even a greater major exporter of food ; 
plentiful for the world,.

When debating man-made global warming, Curry has revealed her ignorance of the underlying science and had to be corrected by researchers who are still active practicing climate scientists. On the one hand, Curry has admitted that human activity has warmed the planet but on the other hand, makes lots of comments to cast doubt on the percentage of warming warming we caused. Given that 100% of net warming in the last 60 years was caused by us and there is overwhelming evidence for that, Curry is clearly out of date on the evidence or is simply sticking to a disproven position for ideological reasons. A lot of her comments have to do with not liking the solutions to man-made global warming and climate disruption, which kind of tips her hand that she can't face up to the scientific evidence for ideological reasons."

Governments need to be seen to take a lead role and the rest will follow in due course.
Continued lack of action will further exasibate global warming so no time loose.
Everyday actions we actively participate in, have to be carefully scrutinised to see how detrimental they are to the full picture.

We're going to cross 2 deg C between 2035-2043 and as we do feedback cycles involving permafrost melting, wild fires, polar ice melt, Greenland, beetles killing drought stressed pine trees etc are going to cause the planet to depart from its current ""equilibrium"" point to a new one on an *exponential* time scale. Tipping points will tip tipping points. As that happens, the rest of the projections go out the window. And it's foolhardy to project that'll happen in 2100. Decade after decade our worst case projections 10 years ago are better than our best case projections now. And still people can not generate 0 mean error statistical estimates after making the same mistake 6 times in a row... it's pathetic. I can not be the only person in the world who has studied control theory and statistical inference... I don't underhand how these people can be so blind.  For one thing every human coping behavior (e.g. congregation around citities, vacationing farther away, eating more beef when there's less fish... 40% of Asia used to feed itself off the ocean, turning up the AC, etc... )  tends to set the hook deeper.

Stopping the use of petrol and diesel vehicles and using electric instead within 2 years? Not waiting until 2030... üôÑ 

Banning short haul flights, and only necessary long distance flights? Banning private jets, as these are one of the worst offenders of pollution in the sky. 

Reducing our meat consumption, therefore giving the land back to nature, meaning more trees, more peatland, more animals and habitats..

This in turn will help with co2 levels and less carbon release.

 It is an irrefutable fact that as CO2 levels increase then plant growth does also. CO2 at 1000ppm [ two or three times present levels] is possibly optimum for forests, agriculture, and deserts.. Commercial green houses use this fact for high yield and profitability If we could increase levels of CO2 to optimum levels of about 1000ppm the forests would flourish; the deserts would become productive; and the imminent destruction of agriculture now sought would make many countries even greater exporters of food ; plentiful for the world. And of course human societies go well during the warm periods. Older people flock to warmer areas at retirement. CO2 levels rise after warm earth periods not before as we are conditioned to think by the fraudulent climate control freaks. Even if you have been trained to hate the most valuable molecule within the cycle of the existence of life , it is worth knowing that the oceans release CO2 after becoming warmer . Hundreds of years later. CO2 radiation in the real atmosphere is about 1per cent of that radiation... This is insignificant and as well as human emissions are also insignificant to the energy result supplied.

Who among you believe Greta-How Dare You- ""Thunderpants"" of the Global Warming B.S. ? This mind-controlled kid cannot, without the aid of a prepared speech, string together words to come up with a coherent sentence. She is joined by the darling of ADL, (another misrepresented, putting it mildly, organization) ""Ahnold""-You Have No Right to Refuse the Death Jab- Schwarzenneger. The new moniker is Climate Change since no one was buying Global Warming which is actually CYCLICAL (Caps for emphasis). Dr. Leslie Woodcock, emeritus professor at the University of Manchester (UK) School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, is a former NASA scientist along with other impressive accomplishments on his distinguished professional resume. In an interview, he laughed off man-made climate change as nonsense and a money-making industry for the green lobby, which approaches the subject with a religious fervor. Explained Woodcock:

""The term 'climate change' is meaningless. The Earth's climate has been changing since time immemorial, that is since the Earth was formed 1,000 million years ago. The theory of 'man-made climate change' is an unsubstantiated hypothesis [about] our climate [which says it] has been adversely affected by the burning of fossil fuels in the last 100 years, causing the average temperature on the earth's surface to increase very slightly but with disastrous environmental consequences. The theory is that the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuel is the 'greenhouse gas' causes 'global warming' ‚Äî in fact, water is a much more powerful greenhouse gas and there is 20 time more of it in our atmosphere (around one per cent of the atmosphere) whereas CO2 is only 0.04 per cent. There is no reproducible scientific evidence CO2 has significantly increased in the last 100 years. Anecdotal evidence doesn't mean anything in science, it's not significant‚Ä¶"". 

It needs repeating, mainstream media is propaganda. The CIA runs MSM. Research Edward Bernays if you don't understand what propaganda is. Research and think for yourself. Stop waiting to get spoon-fed. 80% of our high school graduates are functional illiterates. If you can read, educate the illiterates or we will all be cannon fodder of the NWO. Yeah, that thing you stupidly believe to be a conspiracy theory."

We hear climate alarmists talk about how Big Govt can control global temperatures (and stop bad weather) by regulations. 

The entire scam is based on the premise that CO2 levels work like a thermostat to regulate global temp  - as the CO2 traps the heat in the atmosphere from escaping,  so global temperatures just get hotter & hotter as C02 levels increase. 

It‚Äôs based on this assumption that Australia is surrendering its sovereignty to UN globalists & handing an economic, political & military advantage to the Communist Chinese. 

However, in Parliament‚Äôs rush to legislate the economic suicide note of 43% economy wide reductions in CO2, it appears that the Parliament forget to look at the current global temperature anomaly reading of just 0.1¬∞C above the 1979-2000 base. And remember 1979, that when experts were warning of a new ice age. 

So the ‚Äò‚Äôtrapped heat‚Äô‚Äô has escaped and someone has stolen the ‚Äòglobal warming‚Äô - Greta and her worshippers will not be impressed."

Having a bigger population in any country than the country can support makes no sense. Access to food, water, shelter, energy and jobs should guide population levels. The worlds population is still expected to add another billion people to feed, clothe and produce pollution. Humans are crowding out all other species of plants and animals. Education and birth control are key to reducing poverty and hunger. Having a child that you can not provide for yourself is cruel and irresponsible. We need solutions not just sympathy. Endless population growth is not sustainable on a finite planet. Every country needs to ""TRY"" to be more self sufficient. When there are not enough resources to sustain a population something has to give. Countries need to focus on quality of life for their citizens and not just quantity of life for cheap labor.

So you have even more forest fires and permafrost melting.  Which makes it even hotter.  And so on.

He is said to be ignorant to the extent that he lacks the basic culture or knowledge necessary for daily life, and except for 3% of the American class, it is said that he even hears jokes about whether the rest are necessary in the United States.
 It is said that the majority of key personnel supporting the United States are from overseas outside the United States. In most cases, not only the deaths confirmed during the coronavirus pandemic, but also most of the current confirmed cases are ignorant of basic public health systems and personal hygiene concepts, and the problem in the United States is that most Americans are basic concepts about the environment. It is cumbersome or cumbersome to throw away garbage without knowing the word and concept of recycling, or to sort food waste, various plastics, vinyl, paper, aluminum, and iron in detail. There are many international controversies, such as smuggling waste generated in the United States abroad.
In addition, there are many problems with methane gas emitted from daily life due to random garbage. The bigger problem is that Americans use automobiles on a daily basis, but change engine oil, brake oil, and transmission oil when the appropriate mileage is reached. It is essential to do this, let alone exchanges, and because driving indiscriminately, irrespective of how many kilometers has been driven, shortens the lifespan of a vehicle and emits a large amount of environmental pollutants. Given the stigma of being the country with the most emissions, it is very questionable whether it has the basic requirements and dignity of being an advanced country, and it is also questionable whether China has the right to criticize various reasons and causes. However, it is said that Japan is the only country among a few European and Asian countries that makes it a habit to change oil according to the mileage of automobiles such as recycling and recycling as well as the environment."

Why has the star locations changed from their previous locations of nearly twenty years ago?  Why are our skies paler blue than before? The answers are there.

The IPCC has various scenarios for different temperature increases depending on the amount of CO2 emitted, the worst being the notorious 'RCP 8.5' which alarmists frequently use. The IPCC now admits that RCP 8.5 is now very unlikely to happen. CO2 levels may never rise sufficiently to get an increase of 3 degrees. Remember that the rise in temperature is a constant (equilibrium climate sensitivity, ECS) for a doubling of CO2 & if we assume this constant is say 2 degrees per doubling, with CO2  now at 420 parts per million it would have to rise to 840 parts per million to raise the temperature of the planet by just 2 degrees, (not three!). Scientists don't even agree on what the actual value of the ECS is & different models use different values & furthermore each value is the mean of a spread of values! All very imprecise as climate science is. This video is crystal ball gazing of the worst kind & is displayed to generate fear & as such is pure evil. It's not science. It's pure propaganda.

Whoever is in Goverment will have blood on their hands by not taking up this Earth changing situation. Act now and promote new Science, New wind, Tidal power and carbon retraction Tec. Your failing my family and millions of other families by your none actions. Act now do more now. 

People please wake up and act to stop this none actions of Governments.

Our fight is with the  survival of man kind and shouldn't be with our Goverments, that doesn't do nothing to help our children children's futures. 

Rethink your environmental plans, no more old style big company lead money to fill your pockets. Think not of I but of us, us have the power you should be aware of your place and stop feeding your greed.

 The push back is happening and the World is waking up and the zero carbon target is a must. 

If Goverment holds on the old guard of polluting energies, we've got to ask why this killing energy is allowing to keep Impacting our World.

 Science tells us oil, Gas, diesel, electricity and coal are killers. So why keep on using these killers.

Science has new power from natural energy, so why are Government officials being paid to promote the old killer energies.

 Millions of our voices are aimed at changing to natural energy, we are not being listened to.

Goverments back handed approach is again is an old style way of thinking. 

I Say YES to new Tec, New Science and carbon retraction and No to Nukeilar and oil.

We know what these vile products have done to our World, so why are they using them........ oh I know the old guard needs a pay out.........!

"saintsone","2022-07-27T08:54:54Z","Yes, a small difference in temperature can have a huge impact but what these people do not tell you is that the Earth today is cooler than it was only 2000 years ago and yet these scaremongerers refuse to acknowledge that. 
Do they tell you the average temperature of Earth 65 or so million years ago? NO! And the reason is very simple. That is the period of the dinosaurs. Dinosaur fossils have been found at the North Pole. Palm tree fossils have been found at the North Pole.
Big deal you say.  Well, it is a big deal as proves temps today are cold compared to 65 million years ago yet plant life and animal life survived in that environment. Yet these bozos try to tell you and me that it will be a catastrophe for mankind if temp rises 3C by end of the century.  
Cast your minds back to the 1980's and what were they predicting? Up to 7C by 2050, In the year 2000 they were predicting 3-5C by 2075 and now the experts are saying if the rise in temps is 3c by 2100 - ""CATASTROPHE"".
Did anyone notice the predictions for temp rise is decreasing and the period it will be achieved is increasing. And NO it is not because we are reducing emissions due to renewables etc as we are actually ""INCREASING"" emissions each and every year.
How is it that the projected temp increase is falling yet the year it is predicted to occur in is increasing if the levels of carbon emitted is increasing faster than at any other time since records have been kept?
NOTHING they say adds up. ALL is guesswork. And the size of the impending CATASTROPHE increases each decade yet the date of that catastrophe gets further and further away from being reached.
If they knew what they were talking about we should be at catastrophic levels in 2050 yet here he admits 2100 is the year to be concerned about. In 40 years the goalposts have been moved forward 50 years yet the level of carbon emitted today is almost double what was emitted 40 years ago.

"psycotria","2022-12-11T19:59:24Z","‚Äã@GCSE History Lessons I never claimed all scientists are wrong. In your assumption, you seem to imply that all scientists subscribe to AGW, which is certainly false. Compound this fact with the leaked emails of Climategates 1&2, which expose researcher collusion to hide data.

What I claim is the Military, Industrial, and the usually omitted Academia Complex that President Eisenhower warned of, wielded by Those of the secret societies that Pres JFK warned of shortly before they killed him, use big money to fund only science that supports their agendas.

Scientist who go against this are cancelled, kind of like what Twitter, and all leftist dominated social media have been doing, as now being exposed by Elon Musk.

I was a center Democrat my entire life, mostly trusted MSM, and supported the AGW hypothesis. However, the Rep/Dem/Globalists Uniparty could only throw their agendas in my face for so long.

911 was the start of my thinking ""things don't add up"", as I had direct contact with Saudi flight students, including the alleged hijackers, as well as the Army, Air Force, National Guard, and finally, the FBl. The Saudi pilots were so inept, I once had to start one of their planes for them.

There were so many inconsistencies in the official story, with the news articles that detailed them disappearing after a day, that I started printing out and keeping a big binder of them. When I moved over 10 years ago, I trashed them, believing Justice would never be done. Too bad.

The ""97% of scientists"" propaganda is just that, BS. You asked for journal papers, and I just happened to see this 2017 article citing numerous peer reviewed papers today. Find ""A Swelling Volume Of Scientific Papers Now Forecasting Global Cooling In The Coming Decades"" for excepts and links. The CO2 Coalition posted it.

The entire mass of data I have come across indicates that the WEF, led by Klaus Schwab, seek to do the bidding of JFK's mentioned ""those that hide in the shadows"" to monetize CO2 emissions, finally coming down to every breath we exhale, to fund their one-world government, while implementing the UN Agenda 21, now called Agenda 2030, to eliminated access to energy in the name of eliminating CO2 emissions. It is these emissions that enable you to enjoy the (now declining) standard of living we enjoy. The goal is depopulation; Their world, Us dead.

The data indicates that the Sun, through cyclical variations in output, perhaps along with other celestial cycles, is the sole factor in ""climate change'. both warming and cooling.

History shows that the highest temps in the last 100,000 years, 8000 years ago, enabled humanity to rise from the destruction of a prior High Civilization that the current dogma refuses to acknowledge prior existence of.

I would link to a video on the Carolina Bays research, from the channel of Antonio Zamora, but that causes the comment, and all further substantial comments from me to be rejected. It is called The Younger Dryas Extinction. I'm certain you can find it.

As for my credentials, I graduated high school one semester early with 20% more credits than required. I took an extra class each year and attended summer school too. I took AP and Honors classes, advancing to German 2, Marching Band, Analytical Geometry, Chem 2 and lab aid, Physics, and Aeronautical Science. Brit Lit was the missed .5 credit that prevented my graduation in 11th grade. I did this all without doing homework outside of school hours. I did the next class's assignment while in the previous class.

It was my parents, especially my mother, who refused to allow me to skip multiple grades in primary school. 

By the time I was in HS, I was more interested in fast motorcycles, hanging out and partying. With proper guidance, I could have been a PhD chemist, physicist, or botanist.

Instead, I went to work in aviation, computer sales, co-owned a cabinet shop, and got my rescue diver & pilot certificate. Currently, I trade options, having taught myself a strategy that works in about two years, while blowing up only one account.

Aristotle said that the sign of an intelligent mind is the ability to entertain ideas one doesn't support. Give it a try.

Well, this should bring this to an end. Do look up the formation of the Carolina Bays. Also check out UnchartedX.

The big benefactors of the fossil fuel industry, private and governmental, may not see the incentive to switch up their practices and reduce their profits in the short term for long term global benefits. It's classic short term thinking vs. long term thinking. Even with potentially resolvable technologies and infrastructure, it still requires that there be a strong political will to put these into place--even if that means short term losses in terms of profit, for long term investment. But the entire political structure is geared towards short term thinking vs. long term thinking in light of elections and reelection campaigns, so progress is slow at best."

You check it yourself... 50,000 years ago dramatic change in Earth species then 12,800 dramatic change in Earth species... why???
It is also of NO coincidence that the Earth orbits on a 25,000 year cycle and when you look at these dates... well... they are all divisions of 12500 years.
What has happened is that in the past the Earth was hit by Meteors placing a huge umbrella dust cloud into the atmosphere thus cooling the Earth for 10's of thousands of years.
We are back around in the strike zone another 12,500 years. We saw evidence of this in 1908 the Tunguska Meteor and the 2013 Chelyabinsk Meteor Strike.
MODERN SCIENCE HAS BEEN FOOLED BY YOUNG STUDENTS GROWING UP BELIEVING THAT OUR EARTH SITS IN THIS ""GOLDILOCKS ZONE"" IS DOES NOT... IT SITS IN A ""PAPABEAR ZONE"" OF HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. 
In conclusion ""Global Warming"" let me CopperNickel correct myself ""Climate Change has NOTHING ZERO AND ZIP to do with Co2 emissions. It has everything to do with the Earth simply being positioned TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN.

They concluded the only way to keep Nubtania cool was to place reflective Gold Dust clouds into Earth's atmosphere.

"roni bark","2022-07-21T13:20:13Z","The current heatwave in Europe is scorching the land and killing its residents. So far, according to ABC News and other sources, ‚ÄúThere have also been more than 1,000 heat-related deaths in Spain and Portugal‚Äù alone, not counting the death toll in France, Italy, and more is coming as the heatwave moves toward the UK. Worse yet, we are only in the middle of July; there is plenty of time for more heatwaves to come. According to scientists, unless we curb emission of greenhouse gases, heatwaves will grow even hotter and more frequent. They may, or they may not, but either way, we are the ones who determine what happens.
We need to understand that being at the top of the pyramid of creation means that everything we do trickles down the structure, from top to bottom. When it reaches the bottom, the inanimate level of reality, from which everything grows, it changes it. If we ooze ill-will, it creates negative changes throughout the system, which manifest in increasingly extreme climatic and geological events.
In other words, when human relationships go out of balance, everything goes out of balance. When our relations become extreme, everything becomes extreme; when we become violent, everything becomes violent. Each summer, the ramifications of the linkage between our relations and our world become more extreme, until we acknowledge that everything that exists, exists in a connected, hierarchical system and that whoever is at the top determines the state of the rest of the system.
It is not as if previously, we were better people than we are today. It is simply that there were fewer people, and therefore fewer elements that exude ill will.
Also, relationships between people in the past were less toxic than they are today. While there are fewer wars today than ever, the levels of suspicion and alienation between people are skyrocketing, to the point where people can no longer trust their own family members. As a result, wars between countries are rarer than ever, but divorce rates, domestic violence, and violence in the community, are at an all-time high.
Even the internet, which we invented purportedly in order to connect people, is being used to abuse, deceive, and exploit people. The world-wide-web proves that everything we create, we use against others. When there is such a negative element in a system, and that element is at the top of the system, how can the entire system not go awry?
Therefore, if we want the weather to cool, the sea-level to drop, and the storms to subside, we must cool the fire and calm the storms between us. Mutual concern, mutual responsibility, or at least the knowledge that we are dependent on each other, are necessary in order to restore balance in our world at all levels, from the ground we walk on to the hatred in our hearts.."

We know that not too long ago in planet years we were a covered in ice, then thawed, then iced, and now thawed. The climate during late dino periods was very hot and high CO2 and we had nothing to do with it.  So lets say we are zero influence, what then?

I can understand your criticism against climate change activism, and there are many flaws in the concept as its presented in the media, but please don't peddle misinformation. I have operated a  greenhouse in the past, I work in botanical research, and what you've written here is unscientific poppycock.

1. Supplementing CO2 doesn't increase plant growth unless the other required inputs are also increased simultaneously, especially: Mg+2, H2O, and light. CO2 + fertilizer are limiting reactants, only involved in the carbon-fixation component of photosynthesis and are incapable of increasing photolysis which is a function of light + H2O. In a commercial greenhouse, increasing soil H2O exacerbates losses by increasing rot and algae; increasing H2O only works well in hydroponic systems which don't exist in natural environments. Mg+2 is increased by artificial input of fertilizer which also doesn't exist in nature. Light is increased by artificial lighting usually supplied by metal hallide or high-pressure sodium elements which also doesn't exist in nature. Photosynthesis will not increase if only some of the inputs for C-fixation is increased; photolysis has to increase simultaneously because its product, 2H, is also a reactant in C-fixation.

2. Deserts are deserts due to lack of water. Increasing CO2 to increase C-fixation will not increase photosynthesis because water is still missing for photolysis. 

3. Increasing ambient CO2 increases aquatic carbonic acid, making all bodies of water more acidic which kills the primary food supply of most fish: corals."

Climate Division Temperature Percentile Rankings for June-July 1952

Climate Division Temperature Percentile Rankings: June-July 1952

The summer of 1952 was (at the time) the hottest summer ever recorded across the eastern half of the United States. Well above-normal temperatures during most of June became exceptionally hot for the last week of the month as surface high pressure developed across Florida and upper level high pressure centered itself overhead.  All-time high temperatures were recorded in a number of locations including Wilmington, NC where the temperature hit 104 degrees on June 27th, 1952, a record that still stands today.  New Bern, NC reached 106 degrees on July 22, 1952, setting not just their all-time record high temperature but also their all-time highest daily average temperature of 93.5 degrees. (The morning low was a sticky 81 degrees)

High temperatures were only in the 80s and lower 90s for the first half of July, but the heat wave came roaring back on July 18th.  In Florence and Columbia, SC 100+ degree temperatures occurred on 8 out of 11 days from July 20th through July 30th.  New Bern, NC recorded its all-time record high temperature of 106 on July 22th, and Hickory, NC set its all-time record high of 105 on July 29th.  At least six deaths were blamed on the heat, and agricultural losses to the tobacco crop in North Carolina alone may have approached $10 million.  The impact this heat wave had on the people living here is magnified by the fact that very few homes had air conditioning in 1952.

Other all-time record highs established during this event include 103 in Southport, NC; 104 in Winston-Salem, NC; 106 in Marion, NC; 108 in Cheraw, SC; and 109 in Bamberg, SC.  Charlotte, NC's morning low of 79 degrees on June 27th is still the warmest low temperature on record for the Queen City."

How can any right minded person believe this absolute Co2 BS???
Just because Carl Sagan say it's Co2 doesn't mean it's Co2.
Carl Sagan may have been high on MUSHROOMS that day he stated that?
New SCIENTIFIC evidence finds that throughout history enough Millions of years ago that there is NO correlation between the highest earth mean temperatures and the highest earth levels of Co2 gas in the atmosphere. 
NONE.
The Earth has always been TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN.
üåû üåé 
What had confused Carl Sagan is that he did not know that every time 12,500 years we come into this Meteor belt that the Earth is stuck in the Northern Hemisphere by a huge Meteor. This places a huge plume of dust in the atmosphere that blocks out the Sun for thousands of years and cools the Earth.
It is such now that maybe we have exhausted all these larger Meteor chunks as we are back around in this belt again. We can see this by the 1908 Meteor strike in Russia that if it had of hit Moscow would have killed everyone there though this was tiny. Then in 2013 another Nickel Meteor strike even smaller again. People all had dark skin until these Meteors struck were then White people had to quickly adapt to virtually no sunlight as well as the near east Asians who had some sunlight. We can see this fact as White European have round eyes and Asians have narrow eyes to protect against the sunlight still being reflected from the ice. 
There have been two relatively recent Meteor Strikes back to back giving us this FALSE sense that the Earth is in this GOLDILOCKS wonderful 15 degree Celsius zone. IT IS NOT.
THE EARTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN.
Even the Australian First Nation people's Dream Time Rainbow Serpent may well be the tail end falling debris of the last earth temperature reducing Meteor strike known as The Younger Dryas Comet Event some 12,800 years ago that virtual reset human development back to day one. We can see that all over the world particularly with distance from these Northern Hemisphere Comet strikes that there is clear evidence of Pyramid Building and the earliest Pyramids were build by Dark Skinned People and that only after the last Younger Dryas Comet event are the Egyptian sculptures representative of Fairer Skinned people's.
The Younger Dryas Comet event pretty much wiped out everything that had previously existed I'm The Northern Hemisphere including the Megafauna such as the Wholly Mammoth. 
Just because all of our recorded history exist in this brief ""GOLDILOCKS"" period of Earth's mild climate doesn't mean that this is the temperature that Earth natural rest at. The Earth is in NO ""GOLDILOCKS"" zone but a ""PapaBear"" zone. So whether we Reduced Carbon Emissions or not you can 100% expect the Earth's mean temperature the keep steadily rising. 
The thing we seriously should be immediately and rather quickly implementing is some form of atmospheric reflective umbrella around certain areas of the Earth to reflect away this overbearing Sun before we all start to fry everywhere.
Is it that the Anunnaki were mining Gold in Africa to Block out our Sun and that this planet was once called Nibiru. Maybe they failed there civilisation succumb to 50 degree heat as we even see ancient folk law of people living under ground and in caves. Then once again in a half Earth elliptical cycle being half of 25,000 years 12,500 years Earth was struck by a very large Meteor thus reducing temperature's dramatically creating an Ice age then in the immediate following 12,500 year elliptical another back to back strike being 12,800 years ago The Younger Dryas a much smaller strike that brought the World out of this Super cold period and set us on our slow course to our ever looming ""Global Warming"" come ""Climate Change""?"

Last year I noticed huge puddles of water on these islands as I was taking the bus--buses pass by these islands--on my way to the beach. It hadn't rained in over two weeks, so all that puddle water had to come from somewhere. I later read that it was due to the high tide. But the tide was never that high until now.

Have you thought about it?   Have you studied innovation?  Fossil fuels are the foundation of our entire society, not merely for energy but for the production of ALL technological goods, including all renewables.  The way to evolve your energy technology is not to arbitrarily turn off your most important energy source, it is to produce energy as rapidly and efficiently as possible, whilst innovating,   The Mad Max scenario they envision is indeed upon us, it will be a direct consequence of programs like this.  You shut down your most important energy source, then what do you get?  You get a massive societal depression, which directly reduces innovation across the board, followed by environmental degradation which is fueled by desperation.. Anybody who has ever spent time in a 3rd world country can attest to this.  In a 3rd world country, do you get drone technology?  Advanced manufacturing?  New forms of food/energy?  No, you get the opposite.   You get piles of trash by the dirt road.  You don't get a sustainble eco-friendly paradise.  In many places of the world you'll get everything unthinkable; war, famine, despotism, slavery.  The places that are closest to a green fantasyland, are actually the ones which are by-products of our most sophisticated technological base.  Places like Silicon Valley, or Seattle.   Taking the actions proposed here..that's exactly and precisely the OPPOSITE of what you should do if you want an environmentally-responsible future.  These ideas will directly cause cataclysmic problems, and we can see this already happening.  And by the way, what happens when you force this stuff from the top?  Do you save the environment?  No, you wind up burning even dirtier sources of energy such as coal.  Just ask Germany.  You wind up buying your oil from far less environmentally-concerned countries such as Venezuela or Russia.

Regardless of whether the population is lower or not."
"A La Una En Punto","2022-07-19T20:13:45Z","@Jamie B um, do you think those sources just popped into existence of their own volition? Why are the cars, power plants, and farms problematic in the first place? We wouldn't have these problem if there were less of them or none at all, but we have as many as we do because that's the number required to support the population. Therefore, fewer people = less cars, power plants, farms = lower emissions and less habitat loss"
"Jamie B","2022-07-19T20:01:07Z","@A La Una En Punto ummmm exhaust from vehicles and power plants, as well as farm-related emissions (methane and nitrous oxide)....coupled with deforestation makes it a recipe for altering the climate.

"A La Una En Punto","2022-07-19T19:47:56Z","@Jamie B and what causes those greenhouse gas emissions? They don't create themselves. Therefore, they cannot be the root of the problem."

So 3 degrees more that is about 16 % more, so if such does happen then our summer‚Äôs would be 16% hotter. So, if we have a summer with 40 degrees then to match the 3 degrees you would have to add 16 % which would give you a heat of about 48 degrees. But the problem to get 3 degrees more then the average heat of the see you would have to be also 10% closer to the sun which is not possible. But let‚Äôs imagine that such could be the case, well, we would face lots of rain and worse, many unforeseen floods and hurricanes. So all in all such would regulate the heat earth wide but the ice of cause would suffer a great deal. So the answer is that the earth is at the right place and it is for us to  to change our attitude and ways towards earth."

"Tall Inthesaddle","2022-07-11T15:23:07Z","How do you silence a climate change alarmist? Ask them this question: What is the proper amount of atmospheric CO2...They have no answer.

First it was air pollution, then it was global warming, now it‚Äôs climate change. In the ‚Äô70‚Äôs air pollution was going to blot out the sun and put us into an ice age and mass starvation. We were also going to run out of oil. Many claims were made by the (well funded) ‚Äúexperts‚Äù that never happened.

Then the (well funded) ‚Äúexpert‚Äù climate watchdogs transitioned into frightening claims about global warming. They ignored climate history showing warmer global temperatures before the industrial age showing no human cause and effect to temperatures but never the less tried to convince us with their inaccurate computer predictions.Now we have (well funded) ‚Äúexperts‚Äù telling us the weather system is broken and using the term ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù to prove it.¬†What did climate do before it changed?

Here‚Äôs the problem as I see it. Humanity has been subjected to over fifty years of (well funded) ‚Äúexpert‚Äù claims that didn‚Äôt happen. Have any of those spewing lies ever been held accountable? No. They continue on (well funded) unabated.

Here‚Äôs where I think this whole scene needs to go. Funding stops until claims are specifically defined, measured and verified, the climate change alarmists must describe exactly what is wrong with the climate, how they know that, can prove it with verifiable testing (isn‚Äôt that how real science works?) before humanity is deprived of the many benefits of fossil fuel just because they say so.

Have they said what the proper amount of atmospheric CO2 should be? No. How will they prove the number they decide on will fix climate change? How will anyone know when climate change has been fixed?

There seems to be no scientific method at work here only assumptions, emotional warnings and ultimatums. Could billions of dollars in grant money prompt someone to say something they don‚Äôt really believe and can‚Äôt prove?

Folks there are too many unanswered questions to take any of this seriously. 

Anybody remember Biosphere? It was a 200 million dollar controlled environment for 8 people designed by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and was a colossal failure after only 2 years. 

Do you really believe ‚Äúexperts‚Äù can fix Earth‚Äôs weather system? What could possibly go wrong?"

"Kim Weaver","2022-06-25T22:10:30Z","No, it's not possible to avoid +3C.  There is at least a decade of heating already built into the biosphere due to the lag between the evulsion of a bolus of CO2 and the full manifestation of the heating it produces.  While CO2 is up 50% since pre-industrial, methane (much more potent a GHG) is up nearly 300%.  CO2 and CH4 are both now freely emitting from melting permafrost...that is a source we have NO control over.  Once triggered, it's self-amplifying.  Algal blooms on the surface of ice sheets has darkened hundreds of thousands of hectares of ice in the Arctic, speeding the melt.  This is not yet represented in the models.
So, not only is it not possible to avoid +3C., it is almost certain that we won't be able to avoid 6 or even 8C.  That is extinction level habitat collapse."

They also focused entirely on the equatorial region and the warming flooding areas but there will also be worse freezing and winter weather as we're already seeing.

You're not the only one.

I'm from Europe, 48 years old and quite observant.
Been really noticing the change since the heatwave of 2003 and it seems to increase since 2016.

It's going way to fast to attribute to natural fluctuations, like scientists confirm. And it seems to get more extreme than the most negative models from the early 2000's.

Heatwaves with peaks over 40 degrees on northern Europe. Drying streams in the summer, disastrous floods in fall, winter or spring. More and more intense storms. The weather feels of which my rational mind translates to 'The climate is changing' and fast."

"Ìó§Î•¥Ï¥àÍ∑∏HERZOG","2022-06-20T07:20:45Z","The cause of the climate crisis is capitalism.  To put it bluntly, the main culprit of climate change is capitalism.  Several reports from the IPCC consistently state that human activity since industrialization has dramatically increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  This is the result of scientific research by climate scientists, and this is the period when capitalism appeared in full-fledged history.  It is not difficult to understand why capitalism caused climate change through the massive emission of greenhouse gases.  Capitalism aims to produce for profit, and for this purpose, it has pursued production for production and accumulation for accumulation.  In order to support this production system, an enormous energy supply structure was needed to sustain production.  Fossil fuels were chosen for this."
"Richard Prest","2022-06-20T04:39:00Z","You all think that it's Fossil fuels that is the problem that we created by being here. It's the planet it's self that releases these gases from  volcanos, methane gases from land and sea, earth quakes of tectonic plates are changing the planet ever so slowly. Why should we be able to consume all of what the planet can produce and more and think that we won't pay a price."
"glen paul","2022-06-19T23:28:35Z","The earth's climate has never been static...it is constantly changing.  This is not brought about by man but rather is simply nature.  Man needs to find ways to compensate for variables in the climate. These changes in climate would occur without any humans on earth so it is ludicrous to expect changes in human behavior to affect climste.  The planet has been through 7 ice ages and a multitude of other climate changes in between them and this will always continue.  Man needs to find more efficient methods of dealing with climate change but should not expect that man can actually change the climate as that will not hapoen.  Nature is in control.  Our planet has an abundance of fossil fuels and that is where the focus should be for providing energy needs.  America was recently energy independent with a great amount of reserves yet to be accessed such as Anwar.  What man needs to do is place more focus on our ability to keep up with the ever increasing need for electricity.  Natural gas and nuclear power can keep up with those needs.  We should however conserve electricity by using common sense.  Turning off 90% power to the many buildings that are lit brightly all night long when not in use, cutting back on production of electric vehicles as battery technology is far from practical compared to gasoline.  Convert back to MTBE from Ethanol and stop wasting our food supply.  Ethanol damages the environment and is inefficient.  Require cities and businesses to scale down electricity consumption in off hours drastically.  Undo all the restraints that Biden and Democrats placed upon our energy industry.  Encourage world nations to achieve clean air and water levels achieved in America.  Use sanctions if necessary to encourage compliance.   There are many other things that could be done to conserve electricity,  utilize inexpensive fossil fuels, reduce pollution and be prepared for climate changes whatever they may bring."

Our world is being over run with humans who are destroying the forest of the world to survive and at the expense of the rest of the world .I agree that we as humans need to cut back on many things ,but who is going to do it ? you ,me anyone? No we as humans just keep taking from this earth and want the other guy to do the cutting back. That will never happen. The main problem is that there are to many people making green house gasses in all kinds of ways. Making more cars ,Trucks,planes.and all such is a problem as is cutting down the forest around the world. It finally comes down to human population. The more humans the more the drag on this earth.It's not just green house gasses,there is going to be a shortage of fresh water for all and food for all.Population has got to slow or reverse or the human will finally destroy themselves. There are upwards of 8 billion of us on this earth what other animal on this earth has anything like that many numbers ? except insects. We control everything on this earth except weather all to better the human condition and the heck with anything that gets in the way of that."

The average temperature of the Earth was only 5 degrees cooler during the ice age when glaciers covered most of Europe.

and the associated increase in atmospheric methane.

( healthy topsoil ecosystems absorb vast quantities of CO^2, and america went from 4 feet of healthy topsoil to 4 inches of depleted topsoil,
with most of the topsoil loss in the last 50 years of the ""end world hunger campaign"" )

The will to fix this crisis just does not exist in truth, too many summits, too many debates, too many times targets quota's set as we continually fail to meet  even our most conservative emission controls globally.
The Climate-Change Deniers have adjusted their political positions more into political correctness- thus they can again rule the  mainstream with the people( philosophically) if not in deed and results.

If this was the case the planet would have cooked itself back in the Cambrian period when CO2 was 8000 ppm. Obviously this did not happen because temperature controls CO2. At 420 ppm CO2 is 0.042% by volume and is therefore barely there at all. Get a grip and do some homework and you will have some credibility."

This would also help to explain why in the middle of winter if there is a huge blizzard happening and people are asking the question how can there be a blizzard aren't we supposed to be having global warming so shouldn't it be hotter.

I challenged you to think. I gave an analogy that reveals why your position fails.
Repeating yourself when confronted with an objection isn't ""thinking"". To think, you need to understand the objection, and then analyze it to decide if it undermines your claim or not - or perhaps modifies your claim in some way - based on the merits of that objection.
When someone objects to a claim you made, thinking about it means considering the objection, not simply ignoring it and re-convincing yourself about how right your original position was. To think is to consider the objection, not repeat your position. Understand?
Okay, with that in mind, try again. Remember, it's understanding and evaluating my objection that's your task here. Don't simply repeat yourself.

*If you're aware of that, then you must be aware of the younger drias too*
Yes, I know about the Younger Dryas.

*... and how the temperature change increases the closer we are to start and end of inter glacial periods.*
That doesn't apply to where we are now, nor to the Younger Dryas.

*Moreover, ...""*
Moreover??? You've yet to make a single point.

*... we only have accurate temperature data for 150-200 years...*
The word ""accurate"" is always vague. The real issue is always ""how accurate"". Prior to the ""thermometer era"", the temperature reconstructions have less accuracy, as they rely on indirect proxies rather than direct temperature readings. Even during the thermometer era, the accuracies of global average temperature calculations decrease the farther back in time you go due to more sparse global thermometer coverage.

So we do have a global average temperature record prior to the late19th century... but it's just that they're less accurate than the temps we've measured since then (and even the late 19th century is less accurate than, say, the last 70 years... and certainly the last 45 years when global satellite measurements became possible.).

I hope that you aren't suggesting that we don't have temperature data prior to the last 19th century, squeezed between your examples the temperatures from thousands of years ago.

*... and the earth has been gradually warming up even before those years.*
Temperatures during the Holocene have been mostly flat - certainly during the last 8,000 years or so - and if anything might have been slightly cooling. The point is, the warming coming out of the last glacial maximum (""ice age"") ended a LONG time ago, and isn't relevant to what we're seeing today.

*While industrialisation did play a role, attributing majority of change to CO2 is just being ignorant.*
You just declared that generations worth of humanity's PhD research climate scientists, and the overwhelming majority of currently active climate scientists, are ""ignorant"". You did this one post after implying that Milankovitch cycles might somehow be relevant to the current warming... a mistake demonstrating no understanding of orders of magnitude and how to consider data, a mistake showing that you lack the elementary competence of a typical freshman physics student. Do you have any idea how ridiculous that makes you look?

Do tell, what was your most advanced science class? Was that in high school, or college? Let's put some perspective on your competence to declare that the entire scientific world is ""ignorant"".

*Even during the times of ancient civilizations, the temperatures were increasing and cities being submerged, you're totally overlooking that to fit your point.*
I'm overlooking it because it's irrelevant. Isolated and anecdotal incidents aren't scientifically relevant - we don't need them when we have actual data on the matter in question. Of course, if they represented some kind of conflict with the scientific findings, then that would be something interesting to explore... but I'm aware of no such conflicts.

Rest assured, the scientists aren't ""overlooking"" anything that's genuinely relevant to the science. Whenever it happens that *YOU* think something is relevant that the scientists aren't concerned with, then the issue is metaphysically certain to be thanks to YOUR ignorance in evaluating what's relevant, and definitely is not THEIR willful oversight in order to somehow argue whatever your delusions are about the scientist's imagined ""agenda""."

Global warming itself is a natural occurrence that will always be inevitable.  We are powerless to halt that but we can act on how we use resources."

"Tech","2022-05-26T10:47:15Z","@AJ Well, some developed countries are already limiting their population so that every civilian gets a balanced life and also for cleaner Eco-system (e.g some European countries like Sweden, Norway, Belgium, & etc). And they are also taking actions against global warming by using clean energy sources like solar, wind thermal, and besides this, they are now going greener every day by using electric cars and other methods to achieve zero emissions. 

You are also right, Some developed countries emit the most CO2 in the air then non developed countries, for example China & USA. USA might not have a large population but they still emits large amount of CO2. Why?

THE REASON:
China & USA are emitting most of the CO2 then others countries because they have thousands of industries producing products for the population of their own country and also for the population of all around the Earth. They not only sell & use industrial products in their own country but for other countries too. Most of the countries in Asia uses Chines and Japanese products. And most of the Americas uses USA Products. And Europeans sell & uses their own products in their countries.  

So what I mean that the demands of the population are increasing day by day. Some of their demands are  like cars, mobile phones, computers, ACs  and etc, etc, and many many other things. With the increase in population the demands also increases. So they build more factories, supply traffic, that uses tons of oil, gas,coal per day and then releases into the atmosphere. The supply traffic for example are trucks, trains, plans, ships. Beside these supply traffic vehicles, millions of civilian traffic emits tons of CO2 in the air per day. Civilian traffic are Bikes, Cars, Buses, Trains, Plans and Ships.

Only those people wants the population to grow who owns business. They are happy if their are more customers to buy their products to fill their pockets. They don't care about the planet or its resources or the next generation or the impacts of over populations.

They clear forests for factories, agricultural lands and Civilian populations. In this process they also destroy the Eco-System. So the earth one day won't be having enough resources to fulfill everyone's basic needs like food, water, cloths, shelter and medical needs, and forget about the other needs. 

If the current situation goes on the future will be HORRIFIC and I am absolutely sure about it and those too who are well aware of the over population impacts on this Earth.  

I am not in favor of wiping out populations but I want the people to be responsible about their actions. But the things is that only those people take responsibility who are educated, only those give sacrifices for the sack of better future of all the people on this Earth, the next generations & for the animal life too. Those who are not educated, it is the responsibility of their governments to educate them and make them aware."

"Oliver Grumitt","2022-05-21T21:11:10Z","Talking about climate change is really most appropriately a load of hot air, meaning nothing or very little has been done about it.  There is nothing to indicate anything will change, certainly not in the time people say it should be.  Emissions still increase every year, populations still keep rising a lot especially in countries like India and in Brazil  they have a President who actually wants to destroy the Rainforest, wars keep raging on, the threat of nuclear war has increased a lot with the attack on Ukraine,  and poverty and corruption just get worse and worse.  Also economic inequalities, greed and so many other nasty things as well. 
Assuming scientists are right that  fossil fuels will destroy civilization, then obviously the time to have prevented the use of fossil fuels would have  been in the early 1800s, at the time of the industrial revolution now about 200 years ago.  If problems have been accumulating since then, it will take at least another 200 years, if not longer, to reverse those trends. It is very likely too late to stop those trends now, let alone in 200 years. 
It is inevitable civilization will destroy itself before too long, in 50 to 100 years at the very latest, either through climatic changes, nuclear war, overpopulation,  depletion of vital resources, or a virus pandemic a lot worse than the present Covid one.  It is only a case of which 
One it will be, indeed it may be a combination of 2, 3, 4 or all 5. 
Actually we are very lucky humanity has already  not wiped itself out yet!  If other civilizations elsewhere, if they exist, are like us, or anything like us, they too may last only a very short time before self destruction, and that may be one reason we have not yet detected them 
Yet."

‚ÄúMost of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born...by 1975 some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980 ºs.‚Äù Paul Erlich.

""Air pollution..is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.‚Äù Paul Erlich.

‚ÄúBy the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate that there won ºt be any more crude oil. You ºll drive up to the pump and say,  ªFill  ªer up, buddy, º and he ºll say,  ªI am very sorry, there isn ºt any.‚Äù Ecologist Kenneth Watt.

‚ÄúOne theory assumes that the earth ºs cloud cover will continue to thicken as more dust, fumes and water vapor are belched into the atmosphere by industrial smokestacks and jet planes.

‚ÄúThe world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years. If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000.

"David Roscoe","2022-07-30T23:53:31Z","@Kryptonarie 63 In a stunning development today, the community of global climate scientists announced that the problem of global warming is actually one of global cooling, overturning decades of previously accepted, peer-reviewed science. Apparently, a few weeks ago, a graduate student at the University of California discovered, through the mistaken introduction of an erroneous ""minus"" sign into all climate data sets back in 1882, that all data suggesting growing concentrations of greenhouse gases, rising temperatures, increasing sea level, disappearing ice, and other changes were actually completely backward.

""We're very embarrassed,"" said Dr. Melissa Tonnennsen, a climate scientist with NASA, ""but we must admit that sign errors do occasionally occur. We normally discover them, but this one slipped by us for over a century. The climate is still changing -- we got that right -- it's just that everything is going in the other direction.""

When the error in each data set is corrected, the global average temperature can be seen clearly to be declining (Figure 1), sea level is dropping, not rising, and the amount of ice in the Arctic is really growing rapidly, not decreasing (Figure 2). Even the iconic image of rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, measured for half a century at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, turns out to be wrong -- affected by the same error. Figure 3 shows that in fact, atmospheric carbon dioxide is dropping, not rising. ""We now realize,"" said Dr. Tonnennsen, ""that burning fossil fuels takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, it doesn't put it in."" 

This discovery was not touched on by the global media as it does not suit the politics or dogma around this issue. Science gets thing wrong more often than not. We certainly need to reduce our dependence on fossil as an ice age would be something we need to take rather more seriously."
"Kryptonarie 63","2022-07-30T19:50:34Z","@David Roscoe 
You're wrong, and the following information comes directly right from NASA/climate. 
One of the ‚Äúsmoking guns‚Äù that tells us the Sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of solar energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites, which tell us that there has been no upward trend in the amount of solar energy reaching our planet.

A second smoking gun is that if the Sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a buildup of heat-trapping gases (CO¬≤ for example) near Earth's surface, and not by the Sun getting ‚Äúhotter.‚Äù

Sun spots can change the climate that fast but they go in 11 year cycles. So the temperature drops too. 

Otherwise Milankovitch cycles can sustain such a rise over a long time but they take tens of thousands of years to change. Not decades. 

It is a lot easier for the earth to cool down than it is to heat up. All you need is a period of lower sun activity for it to cool down. For it to heat up by 1.5-2C in the space of 50 years and stay that way is quite extreme.

It shows 
Iceage minimum, CO2 levels were 280ppm and average global temperature was 15c 
Iceage maximum,  CO2 levels were 180ppm and average global temperature was 7c 
This shows that a 100ppm change in CO2 levels will cause an 8c global temperature change 
8c/100ppm or 1c/12ppm 
Today, global CO2 levels are 420ppm, 140ppm above iceage minimum of 280ppm 
140ppm √∑ 1c/12ppm = 11.75c rise 
AGGI is 585ppm,  305ppm above iceage minimum 
305ppm √∑ 1c/12ppm =25.4c rise 
The temperatures on the right side corrolate to global CO2 levels 
This is the equilibrium temperatures of global CO2 levels 
180ppm = 7c
280ppm = 15c
300ppm = 17c 
420ppm = 26.75c 
585ppm = 40.4c this is where the AGGI levels will cause global temperatures to rise to

"David Elze","2022-04-24T17:36:28Z","The biggest idea I am trying to express is tunneling aqueducts from the coast, in this case the west coast of the USA inland to feed combination geothermal power and sea water desalination plants.  The idea seems to be so big that no one has considered it possible but I believe it is not only possible but it is necessary. For over a century the fossil water contained in aquifers has been pumped out to feed agriculture, industry and municipal water needs. The natural water cycle cant refill fossil water deposits that were filled 10,000 years ago when the glaciers melted after the last ice age. Without refilling these aquifers there is not much of a future for the region of the United states. As a result ground levels in some areas of the San Joaquin Valley have subsided by more than 30 feet. Similar fossil water depletion is happening in other regions all around the world. TBM and tunneling technology has matured and further developments in the industry are poised to speed up the tunneling process and it's these tunnels that are the only way to move large volumes of water from the ocean inland. The water is moved inland to areas where it can be desalinated in geothermal plants producing clean water and power. In many cases the water will recharge surface reservoirs where it will be used first to make more hydro power before being released into rivers and canal systems. It's very important however to not stop tunneling at these first stops but to continue several legs until the water has traveled from the ocean under mountain ranges to interior states. Along the way water will flow down grade through tunnels and rise in geothermal loops to fill mountain top pumped hydro batteries several times before eventually recharging several major aquifers. What I am proposing is essentially reversing the flow of the Colorado River Compact. Bringing water from the coast of California first to mountaintop reservoirs then to the deserts of Nevada and Arizona and on to Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. This big idea looks past any individual city or states problems and looks at the whole and by using first principles identifies the actual problem and only solution. 

Thank you for your time, I would like the opportunity to explain in further detail and answer any questions"
"hippomancy","2022-04-24T13:12:13Z","3 degrees is inevitable given human nature and current politics. and it won't take until 2300. the modelling tends to just cover prior developments, but with methane release in the arctic and the exponential increased melting of glaciers (removing their cooling effects) we might be able to hold it to 3 degrees if we follow all the mitigating protocols."
"DwayneShaw1","2022-04-24T13:05:44Z","I'm convinced climate change has reached a point of no return. Which, assuming I'm right, you're not likely to hear about any time soon. What are they gonna say? ""We tried to warn you, but it's too late now... smoke em if ya got em ..""? -  But, I've only got a 7th grade education, so what do I know? - other than;

There are two long standing problems with doing something about climate change. 
1) the longer we wait to enact meaningful and effective changes the more drastic and potentially economically disruptive those changes have to be - which creates more pressure from opposition and science deniers.
2) There looms various 'tipping points' where Mother Nature takes over and starts expelling gases in a self-perpetuating cycle that humans can't do anything about

I'm fairly certain we've already reached a 'tipping point' of no return. The permafrost is melting at rates 70 years ahead of projections (per CCAG). The pools that are forming are not refreezing. They retain more solar heat; expanding and multiplying; and expelling more gases. As more CO2 and, at least 10x's worse (as a 'greenhouse gas'), methane are released - temps will rise. At a certain temperature and saturation the oceans will begin releasing trapped CO2 as well. From what I've been seeing the past year or so we have lost the ability to mitigate the problem.

A third issue has been that even those who believe in and care about global warming, including myself, do little more than pay lip service and make concerned faces IF the subject comes up. I'll be dead within 20 years or so anyway and have no children or family to worry about - those that do seem oddly indifferent for an animal capable of blushing ...

- Transition from materials like plastic to sustainable + eco-friendly ones like bamboo.
- Transition from fossil fuels for energy to renewable ones like solar, wind, and hydropower.
- Find solutions to minimize energy and resource waste around the globe.

What this video purposely fails to mention is that in the likelihood of a minor temp increase (unlikely) is all the environmental processes by which it would need to raise to such a temperature and all the changes in the environment that will occur to counter such dramatic, negative outcomes. 
   The false premise is that CO2 levels increased in our atmosphere will trap SO MUCH heat causing a change reaction of effects that will Ultimately result in hotter temperatures. The only problem is CO2 has an absorption limit and won't allow for permanent trapping of heat. CO2 is a limited absorber of heat and therefore regulates the globe at a comfortable temperature. If excess CO2 builds up, the earth absorbs more of it. More trees will grow and all vegetation will grow bigger. Oxygen levels will increase. There's too many lies to list üòí 
   Just know a temp increase to 3 degrees Celsius is not a big deal.
  Also the desertification claim is hillarious and outlandish. Like I stated above. If and when CO2 levels rise trees grow bigger and in abundance. In addition as a result of slightly higher Temps there would be more moisture rising into our atmosphere which would create more rain. üòÄ"

I am 42 and it's definitely warmer on average here in the UK than it was when I was a kid. It's noticeable to the point where during most winters, I can now sleep with my window open. This would have been impossible 30 years ago. The water levels in the streams are down by massive margins too. Some of the streams I played around in as a kid are almost dried up now. Another thing I've noticed is that the seasons appear to be changing. They're not as defined as they were 30 years ago. Back then, you'd have fairly consistent seasons. Summers would be warm with deep blue skies. It would begin getting cold in late October and December/January/February/early Match would consistently be icy cold."

The last six months is also the darkest period at the South Pole, which is where the name polar darkness (also¬†called polar night)comes from. Here, the sun sets for the last time around the spring equinox, and does not rise again until near the autumn equinox six months later.¬†

The oceans absorb the CO2, making it more acidic, and plankton and other organisms that produce O2 perish due to the acidity. This means less photosynthesis and more atmospheric CO2. Another example is through the melting of ice caps. When the sea levels rise, more land is covered by water. Land surfaces reflect more light than the oceans, and so more sunlight is trapped, creating more heat. There are many more examples of feedback loops."

"THE FAT YOU EAT IS THE FAT YOU WEAR","2022-03-23T07:17:06Z","To limit global warming, rich countries like Canada must end oil and gas production by 2034: report  -----------------
For the world to have a shot at limiting global warming to 1.5 C, Canada and other wealthy fossil fuel producing nations need to stop all production by 2034, according to a new report.

The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions required to secure a livable future is ‚Äúfar more challenging‚Äù than any global leader is prepared to acknowledge, said Kevin Anderson, one of the authors of the report and a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester. Emissions from fossil fuels are one of the main drivers of human-caused climate change.

Published on March 21, the report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes different phaseout dates for oil and gas producing countries by grouping them according to their differing wealth, development and economic reliance on fossil fuels.

It found there isn‚Äôt room for any country in the world to increase fossil fuel production, and wealthy countries like Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. must be the first to end production to give smaller, poorer nations an equitable transition and provide them with financial support. The richest countries, which produce over a third of the world‚Äôs oil and gas, must cut output by 74 per cent by 2030 while the poorest, which supply just one ninth of global demand, must cut back by 14 per cent.

If wealthy countries end fossil fuel production by 2034, middle-income countries by 2043 and the poorest countries by 2050, the world will have a 50 per cent chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 C, according to the report.

‚ÄúWould we be prepared to put our children on a plane with a 50/50 chance they're going to land safely?‚Äù Anderson asked. ‚ÄúI think we probably wouldn't ‚Ä¶ Why is it better to take that risk with their futures?‚Äù

A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that even if countries act urgently and limit global warming to 1.5 C ‚Äî the threshold scientists say is necessary to maintain a livable planet ‚Äî the world will still face ‚Äúunavoidable‚Äù and steadily worsening impacts from climate change over the next two decades.

Canada has had a taste of these impacts with the deadly heat wave, floods and wildfires that plagued B.C. last year. Anderson said people in poor countries are already suffering more severe effects of climate change, and warming beyond 1.5 C is ‚Äúnearly a death sentence.‚Äù

‚ÄúMany people are suffering and dying from climate change a long way from the places that are causing the problems like the E.U., the U.K., Canada, the U.S.,‚Äù he said.

The report found wealthy nations must phase out fossil fuel production well before poorer producing nations for there to be any semblance of an equitable transition.

The authors determined how much economic capacity all the fossil fuel producing countries have by calculating each nation‚Äôs GDP without oil and gas revenues.

Despite being small fossil fuel producers, countries like South Sudan, Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon have little economic revenue apart from oil and gas production, so rapidly removing this income could threaten their political stability and collapse their economies, said Anderson.

‚ÄúFor some parts of the world, oil and gas is like 60-odd per cent of their economy. If you remove that ‚Ä¶ they've almost got nothing left,‚Äù he said.

Wealthy nations like Canada that are major producers, on the other hand, have very diverse economies and typically remain wealthy even once the oil and gas revenue is removed, said Anderson.

For example, the report says Canada‚Äôs GDP would remain the 13th highest globally, even without revenue from oil and gas.

Oil and gas revenues make up 10 per cent of Canada‚Äôs GDP, according to the report, which is ‚Äúnot an insignificant amount, but an amount that's relatively easy for us to replace with other sources,‚Äù said Catherine Abreu, founder of Destination Zero and a member of Canada‚Äôs Net-Zero Advisory Body.

If we ‚Äúkeep up the pretence‚Äù that Canada‚Äôs oil and gas industry is critical for the country‚Äôs economic well-being and it will be ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù to transition, ‚Äúhow can we expect anyone else for whom it is actually much more difficult to do it?‚Äù asked Abreu.

‚ÄúCanada's plans for fossil fuel expansion (are) the second largest in the world ‚Ä¶ So Canada is really one of the worst culprits in putting forward plans for this industry that are really out of step with our commitments in the Paris Agreement.‚Äù

The Canada Energy Regulator says that under the country‚Äôs current policies, Canadian oil production is projected to keep increasing and peak in 2040 before declining slightly, while gas production will steadily increase to 40 per cent above current levels by 2050. It does not include any scenarios compatible with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or holding to 1.5 C.

The phaseout dates in the report were calculated by taking stock of the world‚Äôs carbon budget, countries‚Äô total fossil fuel production and their economic ability to phase out coal, oil and gas. Although this method allowed some wiggle room to give poorer countries more time to transition, it is ‚Äústill not fair for poorer countries‚Äù and needs to be paired with ‚Äúbig financial transfers‚Äù from wealthy countries, said Anderson.

‚ÄúOur pathways still (are) unfair on the poorer parts of the world if you look at the total emissions per person over the timeframe that we have,‚Äù he said. The fact that women, children and people of colour are most impacted by climate change points to a broader issue of racism embedded in climate action, or lack thereof, Anderson added, and the institutional racism that exists in the Global North also manifests itself globally.

‚ÄúWe've been highly inequitable to people who have suffered those racial injustices for centuries now and we're just layering another racial injustice on top,‚Äù he said.

The federal government recently announced that $315 million of Canada‚Äôs five-year, $5.3-billion climate finance commitment will be available for organizations in Canada and the Global South to partner on climate adaptation projects, but rich countries ‚Äî including Canada ‚Äî are still falling well short of what is needed.

At the end of the month, the federal government will unveil its emissions reduction plan, which Abreu says is the first step to acknowledging Canada has to tackle oil and gas sector emissions. This report makes it clear we need to be going beyond that first step and account for the emissions from the oil and gas we export, not just production, said Abreu.

The report does not include negative-emissions technologies like carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions because ‚Äúthey are highly uncertain and speculative, (and) we do not have any examples at scale,‚Äù said Anderson.

‚ÄúIt's dangerous to assume that it will work when it's that uncertain,‚Äù he said, noting the report‚Äôs authors still researched negative-emissions technologies but left them out to avoid increasing the carbon budget without a guarantee it is safe to do so.

‚ÄúWe always ignore the part of the science that tells us actually, the budgets might be much smaller so your policies need to be much more stringent,‚Äù he said.

World leaders are gambling if they continue to use more fossil fuels and don‚Äôt act urgently to phase them out, he added.

‚ÄúWe're playing Russian roulette with our own children's futures,‚Äù said Anderson. ‚ÄúThat's what we're doing, spinning the chamber with one bullet in it and holding it up to our children's head at breakfast and saying, ‚ÄòShall we be lucky?‚Äô‚Äù"

If the world gets to net zero around then (big if) still feedback loops may drive warming up past 2 degrees to 2.5 or 2.7 even if countries all hit their mid-century net zero targets. Slight delays could very easily push it to 3 degrees or higher. 2.5 degrees by now is almost certain even if everyone does the right thing from now on (unlikely).

I do have a profound understanding of these of orbital cycles. People who continually claim doomsday scenarios that never come true and then keep repeating the same claim deserve to be called idiots. Dozens or predications since the1970's have been made the climate change would make the Earth in uninhabitable in a matter of decades. None of the are correct, yet the same prediction keeps being made over and over. Expecting a different result. Do you know what that is called?"
"Dundoril","2022-02-19T03:10:33Z","Ah no.... 
1. Increase of solar irradiance due to solar evolution is not visible on a 100 year scale... You need tens of millions of years to see an effect there... And it's colder today than at other times in the past...eben thought the solar irradiance is higher... Why? Because while the sun  was about 3% weaker 600 million years ago, CO2 uns water vapour levels were much higher. 
2. Milankovic cycles are also only relevant at times scale of thousands of years... The shortest cycle is 20000 years long... They are also barely visible at time scales of 109 years so not relevant for the current warming... 
3. Earth rotation also does not change in 100 years... No in any meaningful way anyway.

And lastly:
Since you clearly have no idea about solar evolution or milankovic cycles,could you please stop calling other people idiots... I mean that so absurd."

‚ÄúThanks to satellite and tide gauge data, we know that sea level is rising about 3.3 millimeters (0.13 inches) a year, a rate that grows by another 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) per year every decade or so,‚Äù Willis said. ‚ÄúEach year, global warming is currently adding about 750 gigatonnes of water to the ocean!""

"David Roscoe","2022-08-01T07:21:37Z","@Joern Haese Read the study done by the Auckland University. AFP fact check won't get you valid information- nothing to do with construction. 

Scientists at the University of Auckland found atolls in the Pacific nations of Marshall Islands and Kiribati, as well as the Maldives archipelago in the Indian Ocean, have grown up to 8 per cent in size over the past six decades despite sea level rise.

They say their research could help climate-vulnerable nations adapt to global warming in the future.

The scientists used satellite images of islands as well as on-the-ground analysis to track the changes.

Coastal geomorphologist Dr Paul Kench said coral reef sediment was responsible for building up the islands.


NASA has published data stating the rise of sea level is only 1mm per year, one metre in one thousand years give or take, nothing to panic about.."
"Joern Haese","2022-07-31T18:49:57Z","@David Roscoe ---- AFP FactCheck: An article shared online says Pacific islands are growing and are therefore not threatened by climate change.

"David Roscoe","2022-07-30T16:16:41Z","Interesting that a recent study from the University of Auckland showed many of the pacific Islands are in fact rising. NASA has a satellite that accurately measures sea level rise at only 1mm per year. It would take one thousand years for the sea-level to rise one metre.

It is an irrefutable fact that as CO2 levels increase then plant growth does also. 
CO2 at 1000ppm [ three times present levels] is possibly optimum for forests, agriculture, and deserts..
Commercial green houses use this fact for high yield and profitability
 If we could increase levels of CO2 to optimum levels of about 1000ppm  the forests would flourish; the deserts would become productive; and the imminent destruction of agriculture now sought would make New Zealand even a greater major exporter of food ; 
plentiful for the world,. 
And of course human societies go well during the warm periods. 
Older people flock to warmer areas at retirement. 
The climate threat is a globalist scam to redistribute wealth upwards yet again.
  CO2 levels rise  after warm earth periods not before as  we are conditioned to think by the fraudulent climate control  freaks.

I'm worried that all that additional weight from the oceans is causing major shifting of the earth's plates.  This may be what caused both the tsunami that devastated 
Fukushima and the volcanic eruption near Tonga.  I suspect that the climate's rate of change will become exponential.  I highly doubt that merely limiting the
use of fossil fuels will stop climate change.  If we are the cause of climate change then WE ARE THE CAUSE and not so much the technology.  
This is about our behavior towards the environment. BEHAVIOR.  Switching technologies, say from fossil fuels to solar panels, will probably make things much worse 
because switching technologies is what we have been doing for hundreds of years; in other words, switching technologies is the same behavioral error.
Each new technology is just another reason to steal from our environment.

How do we change our behavior?  We know that the behavior in question is our economic behavior.  Our economic 'rules of conduct' are the problem.  What is at the heart
of our economic rules of conduct?  Profit!  We must profit. We must get what we need to live.  How do we define profit?
As of today, we define profit in roughly 2 ways:
1.)  Webster's dictionary has 4 or 5 nice definitions.
2.) The capitalist definition.
 In my opinion the capitalist definition of 'profit' reads something like this:
profit = the requirement of draining the environment of all resources, including ourselves, because only profits matter.

I would like to suggest a third, and new, way to define profit:
I think that, in order for us to survive and repair the environment at no cost to us, we must define 'profit' as something like this:
Profit = (the least amount of damage to the environment) + (the equally shared distribution of product).

How on earth can we live by such a definition of 'profit'?  We can keep our technology and our democracy, but we must morph our capitalism with a lot of new sets of laws
that will severely punish businesses that try to operate on the old definition of profit.  
We must create laws that restrict how much damage any one manufacturing process will cause.  We need a new line of workers

that specialize in guarding and repairing the environment.

This is all just the tip of the iceberg.  Applying this strategy to every aspect of the entire global market is a daunting task.  In my opinion any and all further processing of the environment
based on our current rules of economic behavior, with false profit, will destroy the entire environment.

Imagine how much less damage will be caused to the environment when manufacturers can make products that can last a lifetime or longer, and the manufacturers can't
go bankrupt so they don't have to worry about maintaining the company by robbing Peter to pay Paul.

 If you think we are just going to sweat a little bit think again because the
changes will be many and are going to be catastrophic."

  First, it mentions zero scientific proof of connection between the 3 degree rise and all these catastrophic events, especially how the rising sea water works and drought works. Where's the math, why do you draw the line at 3? Why not 2? How do you get that number? Data collection? That's prediction, low accuracy, unverifiable.
   Second, it also fails to mention how every single one of these problems can be solved with technology, which can only be done if the economy is flourishing, which can not be done without industrial expansion. It fails to demonstrate how billions of lives will be affected when you implement their massive scale plan. Just claim something, ignore the consequences. That is fake science.
   Drought? How about stop farming with stone aged agricultural method? If Israel can grow their food in the middle of the dessert, that little drought in Central America won't starve anybody.

Though it has been well established that it is one of the largest drivers of climate change as well as using up resources that are greatly effected by the rise in global temperature. The effects of large scale industrial animal agriculture goes far beyond the effects of fossil fuel use. Most deforestation (the greatest areas on land of carbon sequestration) is taking place to grow crops to feed to livestock. Most of the worlds fresh water is also used by animal agriculture to grow crops for livestock as well as given to the animals themselves. Our oceans are the greatest area we have for carbon sequestration and yet commercial fishing practices as well as water contamination from land based animal industries are destroying the actual lungs of the planet. Not to mention that methane is several times more detrimental at raising overall global temperature than carbon dioxide. But this video never mentioned a word about it. These aren‚Äôt theories. Hard science has now proven that the way developed nations eat has a huge impact on the entire planet. And it is something we can actually change in a few years.

"Karl Wheatley","2022-06-02T05:29:18Z","""all countries took action on coronavirus     no   country's took action on climate change no countries believe that's it"" NO, every country on Earth has signed off on the 6th IPCC report which says that humans caused 98% of global warming since 1850. So everyone believes in it at high levels, but the reason there hasn't been more action on it is fixing the problem requires breaking humanity's addiction to fossil fuels and the power they bring. And lots of rich and powerful corporations and billionaires don't want us to do what it takes to fix the problem. THAT is why action is so slow."

"Karl Wheatley","2022-01-30T18:54:02Z","No, ALL the countries on earth signed off on the 6th IPCC report which says humans caused 98% of global warming since 1850. However, it's hard for politicians to take action on things that require asking people to change, and make sacrifices--and that require the billionaires to give up some of their wealth and also their extravagant lifestyles. That's why change has been so slow--people know it's real but it's really hard to make the needed changes."
"Karl Wheatley","2022-01-30T18:56:40Z","""How much money do you need to fix it?"" Wrong question. We are already LONG past the point where it would have been cheaper and would still be cheaper to take rapid action to fix the problem than to delay and paying for all the disasters we will unleash. And sea level rise is a red herring issue that confuses people: It only gets really bad in coming centuries, but by then, unless we turn things around, the other effects of man-made global warming would have destroyed much of Earth's ecosystems and human civilization."
"Karl Wheatley","2022-01-30T18:59:32Z","""Yeah that is why we have had severe cold, a ton of snow and here in the south freezing temperatures every night since end of December."" Man-made global warming doesn't mean we don't still get winter, remember, we are only talking about a few degrees of warming that can cause catastrophic effects. Also, what you are describing is WEATHER, not CLIMATE. Global climate means AVERAGE conditions over the whole planet for a 30-year or longer period. Thus, a cold snap here or there is meaningless: Somewhere else on Earth, someone else is experiencing record high temps, and the record warm temps are outpacing global cold temps by 2 to 1."

"John Harrison","2022-01-30T23:10:46Z","@Daniel C I'm not denying the earths climate has changed, quite the opposite. It's changed a lot, sometimes a lot all at once. Why are you only focusing on the 42, 70 and shorter cycles of the last few thousand years, instead of looking for when CO2 accumulated in earths atmosphere at the rates we're seeing today? You also draw false equivalences, claiming that a slight 1 degree shift over 42 or 70k years is comparable to 5c shift over 300 years. The ratio of difference between the net shift annually are literal orders of magnitude difference. All you CO2 extinction event denialists prove when you talk about these solar cycles that you don't understand the value of ratios. 

A number in isolation has no determinable value, and therefore no practicable/functional/rationale value. Only after those ratios are properly valued do the numbers they are represented by have meaning."
"John Harrison","2022-01-30T23:02:01Z","@Daniel C Science changing based on new evidence is proof they're doing their jobs, which is to make the best guess, test, adjust, predict, test until it's confirmed or denied. In the 1800's they thought humans would die if they went over 60mph, would it be proof scientists knew what hey were talking about if we were still stuck at 59mph or less today?

No one predicted the earths icecaps would be melted yet, except maybe a fictional movie or two. I think they're expecting over 50% gone by 2050 or so. That's not the most catastrophic part of climate change, it's the desertification of previously arable land. That statement is based on paleontologically recorded events of CO2 induced climate change, from earths past. CO2 has been released at these rates 2 times in Earths history. They were caused by the Siberian Traps at the Permian-Triassic boundary and the Central Atlantic Magnetic Province at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary."
"Daniel C","2022-01-30T22:25:00Z","The best way to refute climate activism is to quote it.  In the early sixties  it was global cooling and we were in 2020 to be  in the grips of an ice age with no oil left.  It was to run out by the year 2000.  The ice caps were to be melted by 2010.  The Maldives were to be under water by the year 2000 unless drastic measures were taken.  Please give me one example of a climate prediction actually coming true.
Climate change is real, there are no flat spots in the climate record.  Looking at the last nine climate cycles and saying, yeah but the last one is caused by man has no foundation.  Who or what caused the other cycles and how is this one unique?  Truth by consensus is a belief it is not proof, it is the stuff of religion and politics.

Odds are, it will be the fossil fuel economy that will have to service these dire needs. This new renewable energy system will also be generated on the back of the previous fossil fuel economy while increasing all its impacts. We humans solve our problems by burning things... we tolerate energy use as is in our nature without factoring in the consequences.... releases to the environment every hour of our existence.

Oil production is already in decrease since november 2018 and the three big producers (USA, Russia and OPEP) are on the verge of severe oil production decline. As a matter of fact, without further investments, oil production will decline naturally of 30% by 2030, not mentionning that the extraction will become more and more costly (more and more energy intensive).  Coal production is flat before probably decline and both Chinese (China has perhaps at most 25-35 years of economically available reserves) and India fail to understand that. And for gas, well, in Europe, we know already what is gas shortage and it's not going to go better in future.

The climate always changes.  That's what it does.  It goes through cycles, and these cycles take time to circulate.  A human life time is short compared to a climate change cycle.  The bad bill of goods we're being sold is that we are responsible.  I would agree that we could clean up our act a bit, but this planet can take care of itself despite humanity....and it will.  We're not changing the climate.  It might change us, but we're not changing it.
Our wonderful left winged politicians would have us believe otherwise in an attempt to push through those green energy plans.  Don't believe for a second that these crooks care even a little about the environment.  Those green energy plans are self serving and they will pay off willing scientists to produce data in videos, such as this, to pull on the heart strings or even scare the public into buying this stuff.
If we ever get to a point where electric cars, or wind energy or solar energy can slide in seamlessly and get us off of fossil fuels, then I'll be the first to say lets do that.

"The TechnicanWithaHeart","2022-04-26T21:55:06Z","@peter jones I actually interfacing   with NASA and at least one Atmospheric Physicists and I researched tons of data on Anthropocene Climate Change and the history of carbon for the last 750 million years. Since 1955 337 that the Zetas joules of heat energy has been absorbed in the world's oceans. Since 2021 a total of 17 x 10 to the 20th power joules heat energy has been absorbed by the world's oceans. That is equivalent of 5 thermal nuclear bombs. And that is accelerating the evaporation rate of moisture in an already increasing warming atmosphere. That is accelerating flooding events in Australia as we speak oh, it is accelerating the drought in the Southwest United States because the United States and South America are a lanina event. I just spoke to another atmospheric physicist today who's retired and he says the Walker event started to accelerate in 1979 which is contributing to Stronger flooding events in Australia or the Horn of Africa depending on which cycle the Indian Ocean dipole is currently in"
"peter jones","2022-04-21T08:43:22Z","@The TechnicanWithaHeart Your little experiment does not replicate the events at the interfaces in the atmosphere.

You really dont understand the physics at all do you."
"The TechnicanWithaHeart","2022-04-21T07:24:25Z","@peter jones I want you to do two things for me. Go grab two empty containers that used to contain large container of soda. Go find and buy two thermostats. Buy some Alka-Seltzer which is basically CO2 in dry format. Go buy two cheap lamps that have reflectors. I want you to take one of the large Pepsi containers I put a hole in the plastic cap I push the thermostat into it. Sticking lamp on on the plastic container. The next one I want you to put the Alka-Seltzer inside that container. That is CO2 in dry format. Again put the cap on put the thermostat in and put the lamp on the second container. Now watch the container with a thermostat that the Alka-Seltzer was pushed into the water you will see that the temperature rises much faster in the container without the Alka-Seltzer. CO2 traps Heat it does not allow it to escape into space or in low quantities it was allowed to escape into space"
"peter jones","2022-04-15T19:57:40Z","@The TechnicanWithaHeart The more Co2 in the atmosphere the LESS additional warming !, additional warming DECREASES LOGARITHMICALLY as Co2 levels rise.
Its greatest warming effect is at 20 ppm !, at 410 ppm Co2 CANNOT produce much more warming.
This is why Co2 levels in the THOUSANDS of ppm have NEVER produced dangerous global warming before.
We have had MASSIVE ice ages in the past with 4000 ppm + atmospheric Co2.
The paleoclimate data is clear Co2 levels are immaterial to temperatures.
Co2 has very poor correlation to temperature cycles whereas solar activity has EXCELLENT correlation to temperature cycles.
The ice core data is also very clear, its rising temperatures that DRIVE UP Co2 levels with a lag of 800-1000 years NOT the other way around.
Higher Co2 levels NEVER prevent subsequent cooling, indeed Co2 levels continue to RISE for some time after temperatures have COOLED.
Our BIGGEST problem is the gullibility of much of the population who dont ever bother to cross check what they are being told in the media on this subject."
"The TechnicanWithaHeart","2022-01-27T11:30:09Z","@Mark Browning I can respond on behalf of the woman who ask that everyone should play a part in reducing CO2 emissions. It's enormous enormous problem is the biggest problem mankind has ever larger than the proliferation of atomic Warheads and the Cold War. A climate change is an accumulation of several events events that can push Earth into the uninhabitable region of History. A child born today will experience a seven-fold increase of major flash floods, hurricanes that are on a scale unlike anything that humans have ever seen and it has happened before, heat waves, loss of drinking water from the loss of snowpack and shrinking aquifers, massive crop losses and famine in the United States. California Arizona and most of the southern states that Florida will become uninhabitable. These areas will experience record heat and humidity a very high deadly heat waves. The climate migration has started in fact it started probably about a decade ago. Climate migrates are migrating out of the countries that are closest to the equator or the most dangerous effects of climate change are occurring. Go on YouTube and find the report ""The Great Migration has occurred"". Over 30 years ago atmospheric scientist is serious and would occur between 2030 and 2050. What can we do to reduce our carbon footprint after all carbon traps heat in the atmosphere. We need to redesign our cities and give more control to the cities to how we can live and work within a very short distance of our business. Walking to work, walking to the grocery store that's a very short distance, buying locally, buying an electric car or protest to the city to buy autonomous bus shuttles that can pick us up at our house, don't buy Christmas gifts if you have two that are made in China, have one child and maybe to maximum produces 20 tonnes of CO2 emissions that stays in the atmosphere for decades. Our cities need to be redesigned to reduce our carbon footprint. I suggest everyone watch Katharine hayhoe, watch the movie Three Degrees it looks like a atmosphere that is red in color, watch the movie Before the Flood that stars Leonardo DiCaprio where he travels globally with the film crew to film the effects of climate change on every country including the Arctic ice sheet. Watch the movie Planet of the humans which is a result of our overconsumption of the natural resources of planet Earth. Do research on deforestation of the Amazon and Congo rain basin because these forests are critical to absorbing CO2 emissions from Runaway climate change. Everything we do in life has to change if we are to meet the 2050 Global of zero emissions."

"Db","2021-12-07T06:03:03Z","Forget at the end of the century, I think that the catastrophic impact of the climate change globally will probably start within a few decades or a few years. Surely the developed Nations can lessen the use of fossil fuels to a significant level, but it's not going to be the same for the developing countries as people are running their houses on fossil fuels. 
As the planet starts getting warmer, the glaciers are gonna melt, as the Glaciers melt, more n more ancient viruses are gonna pop out. Pandemics are going to be inevitable. I'm not trying to scare anyone but I think that we've already crossed the line of no return, the only thing we can do is probably try to decrease the impact of the catastrophes/disasters that are yet to come."

It turns out that we are most likely in an ""ice age"" now. So, in fact, the last ice age hasn't ended yet!



Scientists call this ice age the Pleistocene Ice Age. It has been going on since about 2.5 million years ago (and some think that it's actually part of an even longer ice age that started as many as 40 million years ago).
The curious thing about ice ages is that the temperature of Earth's atmosphere doesn't stay cold the entire time. Instead, the climate flip-flops between what scientists call ""glacial periods"" and ""interglacial periods.""



Glacial periods last tens of thousands of years. Temperatures are much colder, and ice covers more of the planet.



On the other hand, interglacial periods last only a few thousand years and the climate conditions are similar to those on Earth today. 
We are in an interglacial period right now. It began at the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago.





Scientists are still working to understand what causes ice ages. One important factor is the amount of light Earth receives from the Sun. The amount of sunlight that reaches Earth can vary quite a lot, mainly due to three factors:
 how much Earth is tilted relative to the Sun whether Earth wobbles a lot or a little as it spins on its axis 
(kind of like how a toy top can wobble a lot or a little as it spins) the shape of Earth's orbit as it goes around the Sun (whether it is shaped more like a circle or more like an ellipse or oval)

Over thousands of years, the amount of sunshine reaching Earth changes by quite a lot, particularly in the northern latitudes, the area near and around the North Pole. When less sunlight reaches the northern latitudes, temperatures drop and more water freezes into ice, starting an ice age. When more sunlight reaches the northern latitudes, temperatures rise, ice sheets melt, and the ice age ends. But there are many other factors. So if you became a climate scientist one day, you could make your own discoveries!



To find out more about Earth's climate in the past, scientists study ice cores. These samples tell us that during the current ice age, climate on Earth has flip-flopped between glacial and interglacial periods at least 17 times!
So it is very likely that Earth will turn cold again, possibly within the next several thousand years. But, we have to keep in mind that human activities today are impacting climate on a global scale. So when we predict future climate changes, including the next glacial period, we need to consider the changes that humans are causing.



Keep on asking questions! There's still much we don't know about the past and future of our planet."

Only 4500 years ago there was a significant drop in sea level, we have yet to regain those natural levels !
Most Pacific islands are GROWING !, coral atolls are formed by SINKING volcanic mountains as they move off the oceanic crust bulged by a hot spot , as those volcanoes sink under the ocean their surrounding reefs continue to grow and this creates Atolls, as long as coral growth  keeps up with or exceeds the rate of sinking then the Atoll survives or grows.
The stories you seem to have read in the media about this are as usual factually untrue in most cases.
Sea levels fluctuate over the 115000 year cycle of glaciation and interglacial, they rose by 130 METERS at the onset of the current interglacial, but have risen  AND fallen  over the last 11000 years.
If you make your home on the remnants of a sinking mountain  covered in coral, you always live a precarious existence, just have a look at the Emperor seamounts they are the sunken remains of the first Hawaiian islands  the same is true of the Galapagos, no one knows if the Pacific Atolls will continue to grow though its likely, or if natural sea level rise will overwhelm them in time.
One thing is certain there is NO indication that burning of fossil fuels has increased the rate of sea level rise at all."

Because MOST are growing in area.
Coral atolls are coral islands formed on top of sunken volcanos which have moved off the bulged seafloor above the mantle plume that created them.
As the volcanos sink coral growth kept up with the rate of sinking, and the islands formed from coral sand from broken down coral.
In the long term these islands are likely going to submerge but NOT from rising sea levels rather from sinking volcanic cones.
At the end of the last glacial sea levels rose around 130 METERS, 4500 years ago sea levels fell substantially, since then they have been rising intermittently but are STILL 1-2 METERS lower than then.

overall the Antarctic for 35 years now .
There has been NO overall global increase for some years now, the land surface temp in the U.S has not warmed overall since 2005, and as that system was set up in 2005, we have to look at other data before that, the onset of the pause was in 1998.
Tokyo has NOT warmed overall for decades and a Japanese island had NOT warmed overall for 71 years !
Our fossil fuels are likely adding some warming to the natural warming we are in but as Co2 has NEVER been a major forcing on global temperature that is not likely to be much.
Remember the MORE atmospheric Co2 the LESS additional warming you get, its effect is logarithmic NOT linear, so you can double Co2 without much temperature increase, its greatest warming effect is at 20 ppm, with every doubling after that the additional warming is smaller and smaller.
The paleoclimate data is clear its warming temperatures that drive up atmospheric Co2 levels with a lag of 800-1000 years (how long ago was the medieval Warm Period ?), higher co2 levels NEVER prevent subsequent cooling !, in fact Co2 continues to rise for some time after temperatures fall overall.
You can see that with the onset of the short term cooling phase in 1940 that ran for 37 years till 1977, WW2 pushed up Co2 emissions but temperature fell as it does, before warming again after 1977.
That cooling phase followed the previous warming phase which peaked in the late 1930's 
(and still holds the records for the longest period of hot weather and the highest number of broken high temperature records in the U.S), the long term temperature record is one long series of warmings and coolings over a variety of time cycles running simultaneously.
Remember the Medieval warm period was at least as warm as now and probably warmer, the Roman warm period as warmer still, the Minoan warming was warmer again and the Holocene Thermal Optimum was as hot as its been in the current interglacial, (though the previous two interglacials were both significantly warmer than ours has been).
Overall the peak warmings have  been getting shorter and cooler over the last 11000 years as we move back into the next glacial over the next few thousand years.
There is NOTHING about our current temperatures, weather OR climate that is in any way unusual, all are TOTALLY within normal long term variability.
That is the current reality, attempts by the IPCC modellers to predict the future have been thirty years of failure !
The only accurate way to view this is to look at what has really happened and leave fortune telling to carnivals.
As always every single prediction of disaster has NEVER HAPPENED."

We are the answer to this oncoming cataclism because we are the cause of it. Politicians are simply reacting to what they percieve as the needs of the people. Let us all do what we can to change those needs. Industry will continue to provide the fuels and products which we will buy.

"Karl Wheatley","2021-11-18T05:10:22Z","Speaking as a researcher who has studied what we are doing to the planet for years, the realities of man-made global warming and ecosystem destruction are even scarier than this video. If you aren't scared, you don't know the science of what is happening."
"Hahn Ilso","2021-11-18T18:46:55Z","@Karl Wheatley respectfully and I appreciate your metered  calm response, CO2 has nothing to do with warming on the scale everyone's fearing 1/10 of 1%,
 the largest greenhouse gas is water vapor have you seen Heinrich svensmarks cloud mystery documentary. Watch that
The ipcc models are completely flawed and they've been caught manipulating data more times than can be counted. I don't even know where to begin I've been following this for 30 years before anyone even cared and there is a grave miscarriage of science happening."
"Karl Wheatley","2021-11-18T17:54:03Z","@Hahn Ilso ""we are entering an interstadal glacial period. Like all others it will last at least 20,000 years."" You are talking about how the cycles worked before we increased global CO2 levels--which changes everything. We are driving global temps and all the feedback loops away from an ice age. Human activity is now the main force shaping the future of life on Earth. /

""Carbon has exclusively followed warming and cooling trends on the planet by 300 years and it has been like this for millions of years."" That's oversimplifying Earth's history AND how temps, CO2, and water vapor interact. First, at some points in earth's history, there were massive releases of CO2 which drove warming. Second, the relationship is reciprocal and bi-directional: Whichever you increase first will increase the other. If you increases temps first (as orbital cycles have done), that inevitably triggers more CO2, which triggers more water vapor, which triggers still more CO2 release, more warming, more water vapor, and so on. Thus, a great deal of the eventual warming in past warming periods was actually due to the release of CO2, even if some initial warming was triggered first.

Third, we know this time around, our release of massive amounts of CO2 is what caused the warming. Natural drivers account for a whopping net ZERO warming from 1880-2020: ALL of it is accounted for by our release of greenhouse gases, deforestation and tilling (which alter the carbon cycle) and the amplification effects of more water vapor caused by the evaporation caused by the original warming caused by more CO2. 

Sorry, we know we caused it this time around. 

Take care."
"Hahn Ilso","2021-11-18T16:29:03Z","@Karl Wheatley we are entering an interstadal glacial period. Like all others it will last at least 20,000 years. We are leaving a interglacial period  that is lasted 9,500 years longest on record for 800,000. Carbon has exclusively followed warming and cooling trends on the planet by 300 years and it has been like this for millions of years. Carbon levels follow temperature as a marker not a cause, these are the hard facts."

Most of them use such outrageous phraseology that it sets alarm bells ringing. I also take exception to wild claims, later proven wrong, but never a follow-up in the media because it does not fit the indoctrination. Your ""science"" seems to be computer models and statistics, but we all know they can be manipulated. As for the IPCC, 188 government's agree with a report that they themselves funded. What could possibly go wrong?"
"Karl Wheatley","2021-11-20T15:33:48Z","@r100gspdc I'm a veteran university professor and researcher and have spent more than a decade studying why the health of the Earth is unraveling and what we must do to avoid ecological and societal collapse. Thousands and thousands of hours of work studying what the science says and also studying how people have been misled about global warming and other issues. So I cut and pasted that from my OWN boilerplate replies I use when battling the misinformation that people have been told. The science on this is bulletproof, we know humans caused ~100% of net global warming from 1880-2020 and claims the science is unsettled or uncertain are nonsense. 188 countries just recently approved the Sitxth IPCC Report, confirming their agreement that humans caused recent global warming. That debate is over. I can cut and paste a summary of the evidence to you if you wish.

According to the information space diagnostics of the ICD, the temperature on the surface of the earth will continuously rise, the earth will begin to dry up and there will be no vegetation on it. On dry land, life is impossible, since there will be no vegetation, there will be no water. People will leave dry regions, abandon their homes, abandon their industries. The problem of drying up the land will soon begin, and in this century it will occupy vast territories. A huge resettlement of people will begin. The war for the land will begin at the end of the century. The number of countries will be halved. The country's power will be determined by the availability of habitable land. According to the ICD forecast, the share of dry territories in the regions will be as follows in 2090: South America - 44%, North America - 75%, Europe - 25%, Asia - 55%, Africa - 3%, Arabian Peninsula - 99%, Antarctica - 11% , Greenland - 55%.

But here's the problem, while 300 ppm of CO2 provides over 50 degrees F of warming, the tiny bit of additional warming from rapidly raising CO2 levels further is still lethal to life. A few degrees C warmer, and much of the fat middle of the Earth becomes uninhabitable for humans without AC and unable to support our crops in the former breadbaskets of the world. 

""This is why Co2 levels greater than 4000 ppm  have NEVER resulted in catastrophic global warming, ""Actually, five times in Earth's history, rapid spikes in CO2 were followed by mass die offs of life. 

""in fact if you averaged Co2 levels over the history of life you would get around 1500 ppm, which is the level most plants prefer."" That's an irrelevant data point. Most life that has existed on Earth is dead and. gone, and the species that are here NOW are well-adapted to CO2 levels of 300 ppm or lower. Furthermore, we located our cities and farms and built our civilization around a climate based on much lower CO2 levels. But we have already raised CO2 levels enough that unless we stop emitting CO2 and pull lots out of the air, we have locked in ~20 feet of eventual sea level rise. That screws up coastal cities and ports all over the world, and adapting to just that one change would cost tens of trillions of dollars. Far beyond that, due to man-made global warming and climate disruption, Earth's ecosystems either already collapsed, are in the process of breakdown, or are heading for collapse. The Earth has been in a global browning trend for 20 years due to the hotter and drier conditions we created. 

""I myself have been watching failed predictions of climate catastrophe from the same organizations and some of the same scientists for 44 years."" And as a researcher, I have studied how people like you have gotten fooled by cherry-picked failed predictions from non-experts (or misinterpreted predictions). In fact, if you actually look at what the majority of experts in various fields predicted... all the major predictions of the theory of man-made global warming have come true, 14 different climate models, some dating back to the 1970s and 80s, have quite accurately predicted how much warming our emissions would cause, and global ice melt, sea level rise, and ecosystem breakdown are not only accelerating, they are happening faster than predictions from back in the 1990s. I can provide more details if you wish.

"peter jones","2022-01-12T15:42:40Z","Henry you do realize the higher the level of atmospheric Co2 the smaller the additional warming produced that effect is logarithmic not linear so Co2 produces its greatest warming effect at 20 ppm.

Here's the problem that most people don't understand: WE are not dinosaurs and we and all the other living things on Earth have been adapted to much cooler temps and much lower CO2 levels, so if you suddenly crank up the CO2 levels and temps to Mesozoic levels, most current life on Earth would simply go extinct. Talking about how high CO2 levels were hundreds of millions of years ago when entirely different species roamed the Earth is a waste of time, but it is used to confuse people about the issues. 

I'm a veteran researcher, I've studied these issues for more than a decade: If we don't stop burning fossil fuels, stop destroying ecosystems, and stop polluting the planet, we are heading for a mass extinction event... and the early stages of the collapse have already begun... we've killed off half the corals reefs and 60% of the wild animals that lived as recently as the 1970s, and due to the hotter and drier conditions we have created, the Earth has been tipped into a ""global browning"" phase in which more and more plants and forests are drying up and dying.

"Karl Wheatley","2021-11-21T18:40:49Z","@Richard Webb ""go back, read my comment with a little comprehension.
The hotter planet, during Cambrian period, had higher Co2, whilst having MORE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. Richard, I hate to break this to you, but there was no life on land during the Cambrian period--no plants, no animals, nada. The land was hot dry, and desolate, like a Mad Max movie, but without the cars, people, or even dead trees. OK, maybe more like Dune. 

It's infuriating that all those climate denier channels that make a big deal out of the Cambrian seem to suspiciously leave out that critical fact.   

""colder temperatures PREVENT DIVERSITY OF LIFE! Got it now?""

The diversity of life on earth now is perhaps as great as it has ever been AND we evolved in cooler conditions with lower CO2 levels. We're not dinosaurs, so it doesn't matter what conditions were even then, because all life on Earth has been adapted to cooler temps and lower CO2 levels for a couple million years, and if you rapidly change the Earth's conditions, things go extinct. The last time the Earth warmed this rapidly and oceans acidified this rapidly, 95% of marine life went extinct as did 70% of life on land, including everything over 90 pounds. Species can adapt if you change conditions very slowly over thousands or millions of years, but if you rapidly disrupt their habitats, they go extinct: Due to man-made global warming, ecosystem destruction, direct killing of species and chemical and plastic pollution, we are already racing down the on-ramp to the sixth mass extinction of life on earth. 

We can change course and save most of the millions of species on Earth, but it requires decarbonizing our economy and shrinking consumption in wealthy countries to fit within the limits of what the Earth can provide and withstand. 

I hope that helps clarify some things."

"Karl Wheatley","2021-11-21T02:23:12Z","@024xp "" I suppose if you think about the human species as inanimate objects that all makes sense. In reality, humans are highly adaptable and industrious."" Not quite sure what part of my comment you are responding to, but the problem is that our lives, economies, and whole civilization are dependent upon the health of Earth's ecosystems--and we are destroying them. The more biomass we destroy--via man-made global warming, ecosystem destruction, and pollution, the fewer humans the Earth can support and at lower and lower standards of living. In the past, our ""ingenuity"" has almost always involved destroying nature faster. We will have to learn to live in harmony with the limits and laws of nature--that's an entirely different challenge than creating clever machines.  

""Scientists have calculated all sorts of things that were either completely wrong, irrelevant, or  meaningless throughout history."" Perfectly true, but all the major predictions of the theory of man-made global warming have come true, 14 different climate models have accurately predicted warming based on our emissions, and all the nations on Earth have signed off on the 6th IPCC report, which says unequivocally that humans caused ALL recent warming. The scientists have this one figured out and have moved onto harder questions, such as predicting regional impacts and coming up with solutions. 

""There are very few people who deny that the globe is warming. What people question is if it is a catastrophic problem or not."" People who know the relevant climate science well do not question that unchecked global warming would be catastrophic, but the climate scientists seem like optimists compared to the people who actually study biology, botany, life sciences. What you'll find there is people talking about the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth and how we can stop it and save as many species and people as possible. Mass deaths are already locked in but we can save most life if we rapidly transform our lifestyles and economies.

"Paul Zozula","2021-11-18T07:03:59Z","I know what you are angling at. But before I say I must add that I am aware that in the past life has endured much higher levels of CO2 equivalent challenges. However, there has been a gradual descent of CO2 concentrations and corresponding global mean temperatures beginning 50 million years ago at the Cenozoic thermal maximum when terrestrial life endured much higher temperatures by habitating the higher latitudes. Much of the oceans may have still have not yet recovered from the devastating effects of the PETM.

There were two short-lived interruptions, one of which was likely a result of flood volcanism. It provided a mile thick lava cap on the geology of Eastern Washington, parts of Idaho and parts of Northern Oregon associated with the Columbia River basin. Geologically this is considered to be a minor large igneous province or deep mantle plume volcanism. There was quite a bit of thawing at both poles. 

However, ultimately 2.6 million years ago we entered into the ice age described as the Quaternary which we are currently disrupting and departing from. In contrast to Earth's geologic history during which there have been much warmer periods, even as we have cycled between glaciations and interglacials, we have enjoyed a very mild climate that has fostered abundant and diverse ecosystems both on land and in water. 

With the very abrupt changes that are now occurring this abundance is working against us. On land, more and more it's biomass is entering the domain of Fire. In water, beyond the effects of overfishing, acidification, eutrophication with subsequent hypoxia, anoxia, and euxenia, along with warming are ravaging ecosystem complexity as well as driving some of the mobile towards the poles. 

Also, under rather thin subsea permafrost perched on the shallow Arctic Ocean's shelves there are large catches of methane contained in temperature stabilized hydrates, aka clathrates, that have likely been accumulating at least during the last 800,000 years since we had transitioned into 100,000 year glaciation cycles.

Increasing insolation absorbing open Arctic Ocean water is a very large threat in consideration of the above described situation and large releases of methane there will be much more impactful than normal. Hydroxyl radicals that low temperature oxidize methane into CO2 and H2O form from the photolysis of water vapor in the upper troposphere. There is much less water vapor in the colder Arctic atmosphere. With rapid releases a methane in the Arctic higher concentrations will subsequently there localize to the extent that it's CO2 equivalent forcing value will be 150 to 200 times that of CO2 rather than the normal quoted value of 86 times over two decades. Thus feeding back on itself visions of the fabled clathrate gun nightmare begin to appear.

We could tolerate much warmer temperatures by shifting towards the poles. However, currently the dynamic is going to be very challenging for all of life currently residing on Earth."

Instead of dumping over a billion more on this planet every decade-which experts TOLD them at least since the early 90s that they were rapidly killing-if they had to reproduce people should have been practicing zpg. AND zero kids for parents who later remarry or otherwise pair up. Furthermore, no matter how much people voluntarily-or are otherwise forced to decrease their consumption levels-the birth rates they've imposed on this planet for decades have already paved over most of the CO2 consuming green space, caused numerous and ongoing species extinctions and is forcing more and more of their own species to live in more uglier urbanized and stifling housing-like a bunch of worms in a can, all on top of each other. And housing often contiguous to ever less open space parks and publicly owned forested areas. We're then forced to commute through ever more over crowded thoroughfares, pay higher income and property taxes for health care and more services for more people, compete against more candidates for jobs paying wages well below inflation rates-in the US largely due to over immigration which has added over 50 million legals and at least 11 million illegals in just the last 30 years, driving up the cost and down the quality and quantity of every basic human necessity. Reducing consumption will not wash away the sin of over population-committed by humanity's egotism, stupidity, culture and religious dogma and indifference to the earth-nor the self imposed and persistent hardships and hazards."

 Are we also responsible for that ice melting 18,000 years ago?
 Global warming is a natural process and this period of warming, is one of many experienced by our planet interspersed by very long periods of killing cold.
 It is cyclical and no matter what anyone does, it will continue.
 While I agree about reducing pollution, the more we turn that around the better, it is inevitable that our planet will continue to warm up, until it reaches a tipping point again. Then, it will drop off into a freezing period where only a few tens of thousands of us MIGHT survive."

I evacuated my home at 4 pm yesterday, fleeing because a wall of smoke was moving down the hill towards my house. It was too active to even contemplate staying and fighting. I left it to the pros.

So now, I am evacuated with another neighbor. We do not know if our homes are still standing. We are friends because I built my own home, only getting help with framing, and he did a major renovation himself. We won't know for days.

We are burning too much carbon and converting too many forests to fields and paving too many fields with heat absorbing asphalt and concrete. We can't go on. We are at about 1.3 degrees C of climate change over pre industrial levels and I probably lost my home. Sydney, Australia was flooded three times this spring. An area the size of the US state of Rhode Island burned this spring in New Mexico. A big Mexican city is out of water. The Colorado River and Rio Grand Rivers are running dry. Southern Europe is on fire. Over a thousand humans died of heat in Portugal and Spain last week, there are famines in Africa. I could go on.

We can't afford 1.3 degrees, much less 3! This is too much, too expensive. Making Exxon richer just isn't worth the cost. We have to cut carbon emissions if we want to save ourselves."

Nope. But the same things that caused temps to go up then are the same things that are causing them to do up now. Co2.

The difference being, that naturally rising Co2 levels took 1,000's of years while recent levels have taken less than 100. That's detrimental to most life forms on this planet because they cannot adapt fast enough!"

"Gareth Thompson","2021-11-06T17:03:41Z","This is an important message. But I think it's important to note that it doesn't stop getting worse at 3 degrees. If we do fail to prevent a rise of 3 degrees, we may still have a chance to prevent a rise of 4 degrees. And if we can't prevent a rise of 4 degrees, perhaps we can prevent a rise of 5 degrees. It keeps getting worse, ad infinitum, until we either solve this, or we start reaching levels where human extinction becomes a real possibility (my guess is that's around the 10 degree mark, based on what I've learned about the Permian extinction). The flip side of that is that no matter how bad it gets, it's always possible to prevent it from getting even worse, so don't give up if we fail to meet one goal (in fact IIRC stopping a 3 degree rise is already our second goalpost, since I remember a few years ago we were talking about trying to prevent a rise of 2 degrees)."

First, they miss the feedback loops that the gradually escalating interim crises will create. As rich countries are called upon for aid by their citizens, they'll be less likely to help poorer countries (witness the lack of COVID vaccines going to the poorest countries), or even cooperate with other wealthy countries (beyond lip service ‚Äî already evident at climate summits). The economic disruption will accelerate as the climate crisis becomes more and more evident, reducing the likelihood that anything ever gets done.

Second, by pointing to the 3¬∞C increase at the end of the century, they make it easy for people to treat this like a horror story that will maybe happen to strangers. ‚ÄúThat's a long time from now, surely someone will fix the problem well before then.‚Äù They should be pointing to the unprecedented flooding in Germany, the unprecedented heat wave in Australia, the melting of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia, the fires in the U.S. west ‚Äî all happening now, and all harbingers of worse to come.

"Ali Pratt","2021-11-05T12:21:03Z","CO2 is a trace gas in the atmosphere only 0.04 percent, but the IPCC say that CO2 is a dangerous GHG because it absorbs and emits strongly at 15 microns.  According to Wien's displacement law 15 microns has a corresponding temperature of -80‚Å∞ C.  The troposphere, that's the part of the atmosphere we live in, is defined by molecules with a temperature of -60‚Å∞ C and above.  Emissions of IR from CO2 @ 15 microns cannot heat any molecules in the troposphere. That would violate the laws of physics.
It is the sun that drives the climate on earth and not humans or our carbon emissions."

This is all mainstream media too no doubt. because what they need are another global scale, vague yet catastrophic dangers. to keep us unable to act. a vague threat means there are no clear ways to make meaningful progress to solve, leading to anxiety and depression. also meaning overwhelming resources go towards efforts claiming to tackle it, instead of putting them towards clearer, solvable problems, which in turn would help to solve environmental crises'. 
After 15 minutes of doom and gloom, we are told our best option is mitigation and adaptation. no solutions. No one at the UN seems to think its conceivable that we are able to solve this problem? how is any of this type of messaging helpful? If the problems are so dire, and the world is the richest its ever been, how about we go about funding research into actionable plans, to solve these problems."

"TruthIsFree","2022-07-22T04:48:28Z","I appreciate your optimistic outlook, and you are right.  The problem is, that for some reason, our society never seems to have the will to envision and then follow through on improving the environment.  Look at the US in recent years: In the 70s, there was a grassroots movement to secure some basic environmental protection and laws were passed (Clean Water Act, etc).  In the 80s, greed become the order of the day and Reagan helped undo much of the progress.  In the 90s, people once again starting seeing that we needed to change our ways and there was a social movement to become more ""green"".  This was however, once again undone by conservatives who were more interested in protecting profits and starting wars then creating a sustainable world.  Wars, a big housing crisis and social turmoil overwhelmed any attempts to address climate change and then thanks to a brilliant propaganda machine led by Rupert Murdock+, the US had fallen into a state where half the people now lean authoritarian/anti-environment.  After 50 years of work, I see this country farther from any responsible action than ever."

"" In fact, I am writing a book that is in large part about how the capitalist  private sector economy is looting from and destroying Earth's three other economies. 

Some technologies will help us greatly in avoiding ecological and societal collapse, but the needs of ecosystems have top priority, and to avoid continuing degradation and collapse of humans, we have to shrink our ecological footprints down to 2 acres worth of habitable resources per person per year. Until we get to that, we are heading closer and closer to collapse: Those are just the laws of nature. By the way, the average American uses ~20 acres worth of resources per year and the average European uses ~12 acres/year. 

We actually need far greener man-made objects but also fewer of them and  ecosystems must get larger again: Virtually every man-made object on Earth caused net harm to the web of life, but avoiding collapse requires achieving net annual healing. So we also have to go back to lower-tech approaches, more manual labor for some things, and more walking. 

The whole of modern civilization is laughably out of whack with the laws of nature: Maybe some alien species is watching us now and betting on whether or not we will wise up in time."

"peter jones","2022-01-11T02:21:53Z","@Magic Mike Indeed i read scientific papers and speak to scientists often, including some who have done work for the IPCC.
I have watched a range of environmental scares being promoted in the same way over the last 44 years by the same groups and the predictions of disaster NEVER HAPPEN.
When i was 20, they wanted us to build more coal fired power stations to pump as much Co2 into the atmosphere as possible TO SAVE THE PLANET, they wanted us to sprinkle carbon black on the poles to melt the ice TO SAVE THE PLANET, (now they pretend they never did that), then it was GLOBAL COOLING.
Back then we had been in a normal short term cooling phase since 1940, in 1977 that moved into a normal short term warming phase and soon they changed the panic from global cooling to global warming.
That short term cooling phase onset 1940 replaced the previous short term warming phase which peaked in the late 1930's and still holds the record in the U.S for the longest period of hot weather on record and the most broken high temperature records.
Australias highest recorded temperature of 51.7 Deg C was at Bourke in 1909, that was part of the warming that peaked in the late 1930's."
"Magic Mike","2022-01-10T20:32:02Z","@peter jones I remember a specialist coming to class in 2017 and explaining the long term planet dynamics temperature, how the fractions of degrees change naturally, and how the human activity boost it. I am no that specialist, but your information is only part of it. The best source is read papers about it."
"peter jones","2022-01-10T15:43:52Z","No need for a human solution, global temperature is doing what it always does.
Co2 levels always had POOR correlation with the paleoclimate record, wheras solar variability has excellent correlation with the paleoclimate data.
Unless YOU can come up with a way of manipulating global temperature by altering the suns 
output, then we will continue the way we always have.
Global temperature, weather and climate are still TOTALLY within normal long term variability.
The paleoclimate data is clear, warming temperatures drive up Co2 levels with a lag of 800-1000 years, the previous peak warming was the Medieval warming around 1000 years ago, higher Co2 levels NEVER prevent subsequent cooling, in fact Co2 continues to rise  for some time as temperatures cool.
Remember the MORE Co2 in the atmosphere the LESS additional warming produced, its effect is logarithmic NOT linear so at current concentrations you could double todays level without producing much more warming, Co2 produces its greatest warming effect at 20 ppm.
Human emissions of Co2 are LESS than 4% of annual emissions, Co2 has a maximum reabsorbtion time of around ten years back into the planet, most of has been reabsorbed years before.
For most of the period of human civilization temperatures were HIGHER than now.
Over the last 8000 years the peak warmings have been getting shorter and cooler as we move out of the current interglacial and into the next glacial over the next few thousand years.
The  Roman warm period was warmer than now, the Minoan was even warmer and the Holocene was warmer again the Medieval was at least as warm as now and probably warmer.
The previous two interglacials ware considerably warmer than ours has been, overall it looks like our ice epoch is getting COOLER over the last 2.8 million years."

"Tim G","2021-11-05T01:22:24Z","Every ten years the world is ending. ""Experts"" started those claims in the 70s, the only problem, its been 50 years. The planet is 5.4 billion years old, experienced 5 seperate ice ages in which glaciers extented to almost the equator. Humans didn't exist during those times, what ended each ice age, considering almost nowhere was capable of developing a substantial heat source? The ""experts"" have also stated that even net zero wouldn't change anything, so I'm questioning the motives. Why hasn't a single person reverted back to a stone age lifestyle if they care so much? The earth is 70% water, 30% land mass, that land mass is not fully developed or industrialized. Fossil fuels have been used for 140 years roughly. Taking that data, you expect people to believe humans are impacting the planets climate independent from natural cycles? People will believe anything now days, follow the money. Green technology will become more profitable than fossil fuels and has the cover of being ""beneficial"" for the planet."

""The first great challenge facing you is to face the great challenge--without insisting upon solutions, without fighting against the truth of what you know and what you see, without blaming other people or expecting someone else to take care of the problem for you. Everyone must take responsibility in how they live, how they think, in what they do, in the decisions before them today and in the decisions that they will have to face in the future.... It is certainly not a time to be ambivalent or complacent...Therefore you stand at the precipice. Will you choose to remain ignorant and in denial...or will you choose the path of courage and wisdom to prepare and to allow God's great gift of Knowledge to guide you and to direct you now?"""

Other truth is it goes in an 800 year cycle of Temperature Rising and Cooling because which is due to Sea absorbing Co2 when and after 800 years releases Co2 were now nearing the 800 years cycle and thus why planet is warmer but were still not experiencing the heat levels seen in Medieval Times"

"Trevegan","2021-11-04T10:43:42Z","The Joseph Poore, Oxford study of 40,000 farms worldwide confirms what is logically known into more detail than just the perception.

That 83% of all farmland is for animal farming, and all that wasted land provides just 18% of the food calories humans consume.

It is not just climate this wasted usage causes, animal farming land use is contributing more than the direct emissions alone by all that land with minuscule vegetation to what would be there without it soaking up more Co2 than right now.

So animal farming, in particular, is the leading cause of deforestation, species loss, and ocean dead zones."

The later was the reality of the 'Paleocene-Eocene' Thermal Maximum' period that began around 56 million years ago.  Like the period before it there was no icecaps but with even higher temperatures and CO2 levels. Did the world shrivel up under the blistering heat? No, the fossil record shows it was covered in tropical rain forest and supported the development of early mammals including our primate ancestors. So instead of images of parched desserts, imagine sitting on the treetops looking out over a luxuriant green canopy or bathing in the warm waters of the arctic circle. If there ever was a 'Garden of Eden' that led to the eventual establishment of man this was it.  If you are still not convinced you only have to go back to the warmer periods in the Roman and Medieval times. The later witnessed Southern England with a climate akin to the Loire valley today and Greenland being more habitable than present (encouraging a brief Viking settlement). Let us not also forget the remains of vast forests that lie under Northern Tundra revealing a time of warmer weather that made more of the world more habitable."

Human agriculture currently take over 10 billion acres of Earth's land. Replace the beef and lamb/mutton in our diets and overnight we suddenly we only need 5 billion acres to feed everyone and could reforest or re-wild the rest, thus restoring biodiversity and sequestering hundreds of billions of tons of carbon. What technology do you have that can match that--AND whose mining, transport of raw materials, manufacture, transport of finished product, lifespan of product, and disposal of product doesn't harm Earth's ecosystems even more?"
"Jason Stevenson","2022-02-05T01:28:21Z","@Karl Wheatley Sorry but I am not going to become vegetarian and neither will most people on the planet. Technology can allow us to maintain our diets and still do as you ask. 

""The bottom line is that industrialized consumerist capitalism  is flatly incompatible with the limits and laws of nature""

That isn't the bottom  line. The bottom line is we don't yet have the technology. For example, consumerism in France isn't a problem because France generates 80% of its electricity from emissions free nuclear energy. 

Plant-rich diets ? Give up now because that isn't going to happen.
Passive homes, walkable cities - really? How many of the nearly 8 billion people in the planet can walk to work or walk to shopping? And how about aircraft, ships?

A circular economy, educating goals, reducing food waste, reforestation? Some of this is great but are minor very issues relative to the dispatchable energy equation. 
Greater economic equality? How is that going to help? Socialism worked great for the Soviet Unions environment.

""Hundreds of other strategies certainly WILL stop what I'm worried about"" They will not certainly stop anything. Based upon the examples you have provided and the world's actions to date I have no confidence whatsoever."
"Karl Wheatley","2022-02-05T01:11:17Z","@Jason Stevenson ""Yet again you are avoiding the point."" Then maybe state whatever you think ""the point"" is more clearly.  

""If the technology was adequate we would not be having this discussion."" That's not how humans work. We are not fully rational, long-term thinking, benefit-maximizing organisms. Economics and psychological research disproved that long-ago. We are partially rational beings and our politics is wrapped up in power. There are LOTS of things that would make sense to do and 60-70% of the population wants government to do but they don't happen because the whims of billionaires and giant corporations have far more control than they should. 

""Governments set the regulatory framework that CEO and oil companies must work within."" Yes, and governments and political parties in the US and elsewhere got hijacked by the profit motive and neoliberal fictions starting 40 years ago during the Reagan/Thatcher revolutions. Let me be clear, I'm not standing on a soapbox yelling at CEOs--they are just puppets in a dysfunctional system doing the role they are paid to do. Sure, I'm mad about what they are doing, but whining about specific CEOs is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. 

The bottom line is that industrialized consumerist capitalism  is flatly incompatible with the limits and laws of nature. Either we replace it with a non-growing and vastly more eco-friendly private sector economy or we are heading toward the collapse of ecosystems and human civilization, whether we decarbonize or not. 

So if your ""main point"" is that we don't have enough solar and wind and geothermal to keep ""biggering"" our economy, that would be a critical strength not weakness of renewables. 

""Wind, solar and batteries will never stop what you are warning of."" Not sure what you think I mean, but renewable energy along with plant-rich diets, passive homes, walkable cities, a circular economy, educating goals, reducing food waste, reforestation, greater economic equality, great mass transit, walkable cities, and hundreds of other strategies certainly WILL stop what I'm worried about. 

Take care"

"Karl Wheatley","2022-01-26T00:05:00Z","@peter jones ""the H20 vapor feedback loop NEVER happened."" Yes it did. The whole global warming cycle is 1) More greenhouse gases are emitted, 2) That causes a tiny bit of warming, 3) that tiny bit of warming causes more evaporation of water, 4) that tiny bit of added water vapor causes a tiny bit more warming, 5) that last bit of warming causes the release of more CO2 and methane... and so the cycle snowballs year after year and century after century. 

Most of the observed warming is directly caused by added water vapor, but the water vapor can only stay up there as long as CO2 stays aloft and contributes it's part to the warming (otherwise the cycle would wind down in the reverse direction). That's why CO2--a non-condensing gas, is the main atmospheric control know for climate... it is the catalyst for this reinforcing feedback loop. 

Unfortunately Peter, you just don't seem to know the science of how this works and you shouldn't be misleading people like this. Lives are at stake--billions of them."

Data proves that death tolls from every single natural disaster including every single climate related disaster has been in precipitous decline for a hundred years. Industrialization has made us safer each passing decade. More importantly, just as an example, when a hurricane hits the U.S. 20 people might die. When they hit the Philippines 20,000 could die. In the 1970's 250,000 people in Bangladesh died in a flood. 25% of the Netherlands already sits below sea level and the Dutch aren't dying. Around 50 people died in an earthquake in California in the early 90's. In Iran 20,000 died from a smaller quake a couple of years ago. Poverty kills, not climate.

People watching this find it easy to claim global warming whenever they have a warmer summer but global cooling has just as much supporting data as warming. It just depends on where on earth you gather data. The past earth has been warmer and cooler than what we are experiencing now. Gullible elites with vast wealth have been giving grants to unscrupulous scientists for narrow-minded studies that confirm manmade warming because there is money to be made in cutting carbon emissions. It's a lie. Cutting carbon emissions will never stop climate change. The Sun & its solar wind controls all climate within the solar system. Heat builds up within our planet because of solar emissions & EM friction with the other planetary bodies in our solar system. Indications are that the gulf stream that warms GB and western Europe is shutting down and causing much colder weather. We are more likely to see a 3C lowering of temperature.

It may seem like China and India are the ultimate culprits who cause climate change, but when you add the historical emissions since the industrial revolution, they aren't the culprits, it's the western developed countries. Since the industrial revolution India has barely contribution 3% to world CO2 emissions while accounting for 17% of the world population, where as US has contributed 23% CO2 emissions with just 4% of the world population, and that's without considering the CO2 for imported products from Asia. The west first industrialized itself and polluted the climate, and then outsourced all manufacturing(which means even the CO2 emissions) to Asia in late 20th century, what happens is that China becomes the largest CO2 emitter, but that's obvious because it's literally producing everything for the world.  Its as though the western population got our products and we got their pollution and in the future Asian countries will even get the blame for climate change while the west  must be accountable for climate change if you see total historical emission.üò§üòë The original 1995 Agreement was that the western developed countries would reduce their net emission to zero which would give developing countries ""the room"" to emit more, develop quickly and switch to greener methods. But the western countries never got their emissions down and developing countries started emitting more which just boosted climate change at the end of the day üò≠"

Apparently, according to hm, the technology is  universal and yes, many a/c units continue to run as the temps climb beyond 45'C,  The difference is that a 2 ton unit may be functioning at a 1/2 ton or one ton capacity due to the extreme heat out doors.  To  dump indoor heat into 45'C outdoor air, the condenser would have to get extremely hot, and this would also involve a lot more electricity.  At a certain condenser temp, some machines will shut off. I wonder if they, what we might consider,  oversize a/c units in places like Dubai, to accommodate for the higher temps?
I understand your perplexity at my comment. Details help.¬†
Cheers!"
"David Beames","2021-11-04T05:01:34Z","@Art Artiste Thanks for the info Art. I'm guessing that you made an assumption that your air-conditioner represented the majority of air conditioners. I don't think that's the case. Again I'm guessing that in Canada they didn't expect to have to engineer their aircon to work over 45'C. You certainly don't need  geothermal to do that. e.g. Dubai got to 49'C and the aircon still worked. I'm not meaning to be rude but just saying. Also there is evaporative air-conditioning. Very popular where I live. I do agree the   efficiency of Reverse Cycle air-con decreases with  aircon decreases with more extreme temperatures. BTW I'm not a climate change sceptic in any way. I really worry about the world my daughter is going to be in in even another 30 years. I was just perplexed by your comment."
"Art Artiste","2021-11-04T04:34:41Z","@David Beames Sorry about that. I wrote two replies but I see only one.  I got the info from the HVAC folks who installed my ASHP last summer.  Then I googled to confirm.  Some machines are programmed to turn off about 45'C so as to prevent damage.  Others will run inefficiently and, eventually, will break down. At about 45'C the condensers can't pump heat into air that is already that hot.  Geothermal is the exception as the ground, aquifer, waterbody  is usually cooler than the air.  
I'm in Canada, if that makes  any difference?"

Because of the lack of insight on the part of political and industrial executives, a global warming spiral similar to a violent spiral results. That is why a 3 ¬∞ world is only a short transition to a 6 ¬∞ world. It is nonsensical to believe that the perpetrators will then understand. That is why they will continue to drive global warming. No extraterrestrials will come to save or advise humankind, and no geniuses will appear to save humankind. What for? Humankind has made the decision to become extinct. If in some areas humans will survive, then it will start over again. The loop goes on and on or humandkind becomes extinct. Only if humankind gets much smarter, humankind may survive the loop and get out."

"Monk ey","2021-11-03T11:02:10Z","Carbon emissions haven't trended downward since the start of the industrial revolution. Country by country metrics don't matter as long as global emissions still trend upwards - all countries share the same atmosphere. And you're right, in a sense, that population has a role but that's because consumer goods, methane intensive food and other essentials for life in a modern society, have to be produced at a higher frequency to match the growing population. The real ""Elephant in the room"" is how we produce commodities and how we produce energy. Converting coal fire power plants to solar, wind or even nuclear would be a monumental step in reducing climate change, that wouldn't result in just culling people or desterrilising them ... lol"
"Monk ey","2021-11-03T11:29:29Z","Global population growth is only a small part of the problem. We could hover at around the same global population and we would still be decimated by climate change. The real problem is how we produce commodities and how we generate electricity. These 2 things - intense industry and coal fired power plants - drive the problem of climate change. For example, meat production is responsible for 15% of global man-made climate change. We could entirely eliminate this and rely on meat substitutes or make a push for vegetarianism. No de-population needed. 25% of global man made emissions are from electricity and heat production, so switch to renewables and create more efficient heating mechanisms. No de-population needed and we're almost halfway there! The economic incentive of oil, gas, meat production, and all fossil fuels needs to be removed if we want to survive as a species - de-population or not."

"Karl Wheatley","2021-11-18T03:12:01Z","@Sense of the common man ""As you will find with time, no extinction and you will live you full and natural life span where the climate will look just like today."" You might find it helpful to read some scientific research, because the facts on the ground are the opposite of what you are saying.  Humans have already destroyed half the forests that used to exist and now we are warming the planet 10-20 times faster than it warms when coming out of an ice age. Man-made global warming, with a boost from our pollution and ocean acidification--have now killed off half the coral reefs that existed in the 1970s. Large chunks of permafrost have started to melt and collapse, releasing massive amounts of methane. As a whole the Earth has shifted from some global greening in the 1980s and 1990s (due to our extra CO2 fertilization) to a global browning trend over the last 20 years due to the hotter and drier conditions we have created. 

Due to our habitat destruction, direct killing of species, man=made global warming, and chemical and plastic pollution, populations of all major types of life (except perhaps fungi) are in steady decline and the health of all major ecosystems has been badly disrupted or is in decline. 

Rates of extinctions of species are 10s or times higher to 100s of times higher than the normal background rate and we are steadily moving towards a much less inhabitable earth. Some scientists say that we are already in the early stages of the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. 

Thus, the people who know the science are anywhere from scared to terrified, and anyone who says there's nothing to worry about is someone who hasn't read the science."

I don't think that human as species can go extinct even with the adverse effects of climate disaster, but surely human civilization that reached the level we are at will surely fall. The rich will get richer while they leave the poor to suffer and die while the rich getting more and more numb about other people's pain.

"Alexander Vocelka","2021-11-02T19:08:37Z","As energy consumption per head will double until the end of the century, and 3 bn people still live in poverty and will have to use the cheap carbon energy storages we can expect a 4-6 Kelvin increase if the models are correct.
Pole temperatures will increase the most as the arctic albedo collapses once the very thin 3-4 m thick ice shield is melted away permanently. Up to plus 6-8 Kelvin rise will result. However it will take centuries for Greenland ice to melt away.
1200ppm CO2 will be reached, which will see a dramatic increase in plant growth and vegetation density. Fauna will follow flora. Temperatures  on the equator will be only about 2  Kelvin higher, While desert belts will be moved to slightly higher latitudes.
No one really believes that energy consumption will stall or even decrease. Economists know this would lead to large scale wars. So if the models are correct this scenario has a bigger than 90% chance to play out. Adaptation is the way that all life goes when climate changes happen. Adaptation is about 90% more effective than mitigation, while resistance leads to extinction , and is the least  (or most) effective depending on the perspective. This is where businesses show their agility. They quickly adapt and everything becomes green and clean, and sustainable, Adaptation is the secret of evolution and the most energy efficient response to climate change. As humans change the planet, the consequence is that they have to adapt.And as humans are very adaptive, most futurists predict a bright, even if slightly warmer future for our civilization. One thing is clear, panic never improved the odds of survival. So we must at least keep our heads cool and adapt. The gap of poor and rich was never a climate issue. It was and will always be a competition issue, a pure free market concept that nature invented to drive evolution. Over sufficiently long periods of time there are no winners and losers. In a couple of hundred years Europe could be a basket case, while Africa is Utopia. Of course, this is not to justify complacency in the face of stark inequalities, but it is a view beyond  human life spans on par with climate changes which always were a main driver of civilizatory evolution. So it all comes down to how much and how quickly we have to adapt. A generational cycle is natural, a higher adaptation rate will cause extra stress. However, with the current measures taken, there will be no catastrophic stress. That would occur with a planet killer asteroid appearing 5 years out from Earth, or the collapse of Earth‚Äòs magnet field. With cool heads and our given intelligence we will learn and adapt and of course survive. We should not spread fear and depression but confidence and optimism, in particular those who have sufficient knowledge on this matter."

Land which is essential for producing food, is being swallowed up by more people wanting places to live in. Cities are moving out into more and more areas, leaving fewer food producing areas. As a species, we cannot go on breeding uncontrollably for ever. There has to be a point where population control has to be a factor in continuing to maintain the status quo..There is a tipping point, fast approaching, where the planet will be overwhelmed by horde's using up diminishing assets, essential to existence and we will no longer have a World in which we can survive.

Were all of our ancestors polluting and industrialised? all these warm periods matched or were warmer than ours and reached faster than what ours did. Earths climate weather systems migrate. Its why civilisations abandoned their cities due to drought. They followed the movement of water. Look at north Africa, its a desert now, it used to be a lush landscape of trees, lakes and grasslands. And the thing with all the warm periods is they all follow the same trends. They get warmer and warmer for so long and then they start on a downward trend. All roughly the same temperatures and time period and the same is going to happen to us as we are going through an interglacial warm period.

 It's based on revengeful racial hatred. For me very disturbing ,remembering WW 2 , national socialists blaming the Jews.

Is the UN trying to reach something that resembles this goal? No. The largest influences in the UN is the panel of five:  China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Only one of these countries can be tied to communist leanings (and it is highly debatable if China can truly be called communist considering their market strategy), while the other four are capitalist/neoliberal societies. The idea that the UN , with these five countries at the board, are trying to install some sort of global socialist society is pretty ridiculous. 

You can find a lot of critiques coming from socialists regarding the UN as a tool for imperialism rather than actively fixing the root causes of global problems. Why? Because the UN is not an institution trying to overturn the status quo, but instead are trying to get world leaders to cooperate in order to preserve the current system (capitalism)."

Climate change is creating new challenges we will need to solve and we will but to do this we need educated people and stable safety and economic situation.

Thirty years ago, a friend of mine got into the green energy business and tried to pull me into it. I asked him what for, it isn‚Äôt serious. He said, ‚ÄúYou have no idea how much money is being poured into it. Everyone wants in on it, politicians, financiers, businesspeople, the lot.‚Äù He was right, of course. Yet, no one wants to promote green energy in order to save the planet, but only to swell up their pockets even more. The declarations, therefore, remain in the assembly hall where they are stated, necessary actions are ignored, and the climate waits for no one: It will keep deteriorating.
This week in Glasgow, Scotland, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference is taking place. Officially, it aims to ‚Äúbring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.‚Äù In reality, the countries plan to do the exact opposite. This year‚Äôs UN Production Gap Report, which tracks the discrepancy between governments‚Äô planned fossil fuel production and actual global production levels, states the following: ‚ÄúDespite increased climate ambitions and net-zero commitments, governments still plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than what would be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞C [2.7¬∞F].‚Äù
Energy sources and technologies do change, but not according to what is best for the planet. It changes according to the interests of politicians and money moguls, and it never benefits the planet or the majority of its inhabitants, namely all of us.
Since the climate waits for no one, eventually, it will catch up with us. Earth is a closed system, and in a closed system, there are consequences to exploitation: it hurts the abuser as well as the abused.
I don‚Äôt know when or at what cost, but eventually, we will all have to realize that we cannot take beyond what we need. We cannot keep exploiting Earth selfishly and thoughtlessly because it will turn against us.
Earth is like a submarine: there is only so much oxygen on board. If some crew members take more than their quota, the rest will not have enough, they will die, and the submarine will sink along with those who exceeded their quota.
We need constant reminders that we are one system, and we are all dependent on each other. We need to genuinely grasp that selfishness hurts us just as being exploitative hurts others. If we constantly remind ourselves that we are interdependent, we will behave with more consideration, and we will avoid the punitive impact of climate change.
The other option is to keep working as the UN‚Äôs Production Gap Report states that we are planning to work, and suffer nature‚Äôs unforgiving response. I hope we wise up in time because everyone will pay the price for this mistake."

3%C or less just isn't possible anymore, unless humans somehow decide they get to write the rules so we can work together on what mere humans need.

Nonetheless we're no where close to doing it in time to keep it to 3%C, nor, likely to save you and I.

Because of this it CANNOT be shown at schools in the U.K WITHOUT every deceitful or incorrect claim being told to the children. 
The film is just propaganda.
For example the huge graph and cherry picker scene, they REVERSED the labels 
on the graph lines.
So actually the ice core data showed that it was rising TEMPERATURES that drive up atmospheric Co2 levels with a lag of around 800 years, NOT rising Co2 that drove up temperature.
Temperature drives Co2 NOT the other way around !
THIS totally inverts the films message
higher atmospheric Co2 is a sign the atmosphere has warmed NOT its cause.
What pollution is your device supposed to be collecting ?

WHO do you think set up the UNEP and the IPCC within the U.N, ?, it was the owners of Standard Oil the Rockefeller family via their organization called The Club of Rome , which they set up to direct and coordinate internationally the environmental movement with vast funding from a group of tax free foundations, in order to use that movement as a mechanism to advance their geopolitical and financial agenda.
It is The Club of Rome which is the IPCC's PRIMARY ADVISORS ON THE ENVIRONMENT,
the CoR consists of powerful business interests and the social and diplomatic elites, with a sprinkling of former U.N bureaucrats.
The U.N has been in a public private partnership with the World Economic Forum for more than twenty years, it was ALWAYS compromised by the politics of international diplomacy, 
but is now greatly controlled by multinational corporations.
This is WHY those corporations arranged for the U.N to be set up in the first place.
Nothing the U.N publishes on these issues is to be trusted it is hopelessly compromised, its simply a tool of those corporate structures.
The reality of global temperature is clear, its COOLER than it was 6-8000 years ago, 3000 years ago, 2000 years ago, and probably cooler than it was 1000 years ago.
The warming peaks are getting shorter and cooler.
This interglacial is much cooler than the two previous.

1) Hotter climate means more water will evaporate. Keep in mind that H2O is the highest contributing greenhouse gaz.
2) CO2 dissolves in water better in cold water than in hot water. The hotter the watter, the more CO2 gaz in the atmosphere, 2nd highest contributing greenhouse gaz.
There are some other factors but these are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Here's your feedback loop without the use of thermodynamics."

It will go to other poorer cities or rural farmlands, that don't have money to build a city wall. Those people will face even more severe flooding.

The IPCC has not issued a consensus that all ""climate change"" is man made or that there is evidence of causation through ""carbon dioxide ppm"" compared to correlation because this cannot be proven. Temperature has been at least 2 degrees higher than today only a few thousand years ago...no cars, factories, coal power stations...just the Malinkovitch cycles. Stop believing the world is full of constants because its actually full of variables and this propaganda relies on us believing and not questioning whilst people like Al Gore make huge sums of money from the green con. There's 45 times more carbon in the ocean and as the sun heats it more is released to the atmosphere, when the sun is cooler then more is absorbed by the ocean which is why there is correlation with ice core data temp and carbon dioxide ppm and not causation."

Emissions are set to _Rise_ 16% from 2010 levels to 2030.

Meaning, about a sixth _more_ gasses will be released into the atmosphere, whereas even with the same amount emitted, still the warming effect _increases_ from year to year. 

So, from 2010 to 2030, we're emitting more greenhouse gas each year, exacerbating the extra warming every year.

In our geological history we have seen the Earth warm to up to 8 degrees higher than today, during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, where the world was much hotter and had much more carbon in the air. While we saw sea life diminish during this time, we also saw the rise of animals like Titanaboa (largest snake ever), this era was much hotter but life on land looked more like Florida with rainforests all over the world including Antarctica.

"Graeme Ratcliffe","2021-11-01T01:45:01Z","According to well understood physical parameters, the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes logarithmically with increasing concentration and from the current level of ~390 ppmv, (parts per million by volume). Accordingly only ~5% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas remains beyond the current level.This inconvenient fact is well understood in the climate science community. It can be accurately modeled using the Modtran program maintained and supported at the University of Chicago.The logarithmic diminution of the effect of CO2 is probably the reason why there was no runaway greenhouse warming from CO2 in earlier eons when CO2 levels were known to be at levels of several thousands ppmv.Remarkably, IPCC Published reports , (TAR3), do actually acknowledge that the effective temperature increase caused by growing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere radically diminishes with increasing concentrations. This information is in their report. It is well disguised for any lay reader, (Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate).Although the IPCC tacitly acknowledges that this crucial diminution effect with increasing concentrations effect exists, it certainly does not go out of its way to emphasise it. Like the Medieval Warm Period, that they attempted to eliminate with the Hockey Stick graph in 2001, the panel knows that wide public knowledge of the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentration would be utterly detrimental to their primary message.From the present concentration of atmospheric CO2 at approaching 400 ppmv, only ~5% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a Greenhouse Gas remains. This can only give rise to a maximum of a further of ~+0.21¬∞C. Thereafter beyond 1000+ ppmv the effect of increasing levels of CO2 can only ever be absolutely minimal even if CO2 concentrations were to increase indefinitely."

Wind turbines and solar energy panels are made from materials which must be extracted from the earth.

CO2 is largely irrelevant once is passes atmospheric 100ppm. Atmospheric CO2 is presently at approximately 400ppm, which means it has already exhausted over 95% of its global warming capacity. Because of increased use of carbon-based energy, CO2 levels will continue to rise; but, apart from better crop yields, we won't notice a thing. That is the accepted science! Whether you like it or not, humanity will be pouring a lot more CO2 into the atmosphere over the next fifty years. No matter how much the western world impoverishes itself with expensive, unreliable, so called alternative energy, the developing countries will grab coal with both fists. China, India, Vietnam, etc are not going to deny themselves the wealth we enjoy--or, at least, have enjoyed--on the basis of a first-world, concocted, quasi-religious, millennium hysteria. CO2 levels will increase and plants will flourish, and the climate will change in whatever way it was always going to change. We are not gods. There is no big thermostat in the basement of the UN headquarters. The idea that a bunch of politicians, billionaires, rich celebrities and technocrats, gathered at Glasgow or anywhere else for that matter , can do anything to guarantee global temperatures won't increase by more than 1.5 degrees C is the absolute height of human vanity. It is ludicrous. Now, just relax and have a nice cup of tea."

"Graeme Ratcliffe","2021-11-01T23:54:24Z","I know, it's what is called, the Water Vapour Positive Feedback Loop. This theory suggests that CO2's greenhouse effect will warm the atmosphere and, hence, the oceans; which will create more water vapour; which will cause the atmosphere and, thus, the oceans to warm even more, releasing yet more CO2; and so on, one feeding upon the other. However, that isn't happening! It hasn't happened because, firstly, CO2's greenhouse effect has maxed out and, secondly, we now know that extra water vapour doesn't gather in the upper troposphere in the tropical latitudes, it simply condenses and falls as rain. That is not a theory, that is an observed fact. As I'm sure you know, nature doesn't like a positive feedback.

Given even miniscule amounts of cooling would all contribute to helping the situation. It's a no brainer really. (City dwellers would love society for providing them.)

It would be benficial to run them anywhere, as long as they only run from sunlight. Given that the Earth needs only a fraction of the energy that the sun produces for us. It's win-win in every way. Even running them in deserts where there is always sun and solar farms, would incrementally slow down rising temperatures. Remember the atmosphere is not as big as we think, hence every little would help.

They would have to be efficient in the form of the carbon footprint of building, transporting and maintaining them. (Plus the solar panels.) The simpler the better."

And, of the abrupt ups, and downs within the glaciations themselves. Such as the Younger Dryas plunge.

It looks like the initial plunges into deep glacial era cold happens in less than a century, possibly on as little as a decade basis.Though the resolution gets fuzzy in the shorter time frames.

Hardly any measurements, no working monitoring system yet in place, only some preliminary satellite data and estimates. 
Methane comes from decomposition of organic matter in thawed permafrost, only last a decade or so in free air, _but_ is 30 times more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2. Large amounts emitted over several decades can hike up global temp up to half a degree, if permafrost goes in long time degradation. Chances are it will, with those higher temps in the Arctic."

We need to move into other forms of energy as they prove themselves to be inexpensive, efficient, reliable and positive for the environment. Right now none of them qualify. Nuclear is an option continuously being ignored. Population growth is not being addressed. Some, like solar farms are far more detrimental to the environment. Laying hectares of panels will cause unprecedented and permanent plant and animal habitat destruction as we begin to bulldoze every piece of farmland, forest, jungle and desert.

As in Michal Manns ""Hide the decline"", not to mention James Hanson also committing well documented fraud at NASA.
The reality is that most aspects of the science surrounding the Anthropogenic Global Warming hypothesis is highly uncertain, some things HAVE been falsified such as the predicted Equatorial Tropospheric hot spot, so there is going to be NO runaway water vapor feedback loop, (always a highly unlikely aspect of the AGW hypothesis), so the ECS is the next hurdle, based on observed temperature swings , most likely around the .5 deg C rather than the higher estimates.

Technology, especially at the scale of a global industrial civilization, destroys the foundations upon which it, as well as all life, depends.

"Jason Stevenson","2022-02-04T23:17:17Z","@Karl Wheatley  You are avoiding the key issue. Non of the industrialized countries were making big enough pledges because the technology is inadequate - mostly unreliable. China laughed at the world in Copenhagen and Paris was the outcome. Problem is the developed world are now responsible for a minority of emissions. China is 30% and growing fast. 
The excuses made to not embrace nuclear might actually result in all the problems the science warns of. Nuclear is not unsafe and nuclear waste can be managed. Nuclear could deliver but Germany closed its reactors and switched to Russian gas - go figure? Add electric cars into demand it it gets a whole lot worse. 
I won't argue the science because that is a fruitless exercise. The whole issue is a big mess. Vested interests and poisonous politics on all sides. And from what I know Bjorn Lomborg was run out of town not because he disagrees with the science (generally he accepts) but because he dare suggest taxing energy isn't the answer. 
Economists have messed it up as well because of their belief that price signals will drive investment in renewable. Yes price signals do drive investment but not necessarily what is required. It makes unreliable energy profitable hence discourages investment in energy solutions that can replace fossil fuels on the scale required 24 x 7 x 365. Price signals have not driven adequate investment in R&D to find new ways to deliver renewable energy and energy storage on the scale and reliability needed."
"Karl Wheatley","2022-02-04T22:29:53Z","@Jason Stevenson ""Have you considered why the Paris agreement allowed the likes of China to keep building coal power until 2030?"" Actually, the Paris agreement doesn't go nearly far enough to avoid ecological collapse, and they allowed China to do that in part because NONE of the industrialized countries were making big enough pledges, NONE of the politicians want to face science-averse voters and explain the changes that we must make to avoid collapse, and they had no lever for forcing China to do otherwise. 

To avoid ecological collapse, homes, economies, and nations are just going to have to use LESS total energy than they used before, and politicians can't stomach such a change, even though it is needed.

Political will is what is lacking, we already have all the technology we need to put the whole grid on renewables. But a whole bunch of the wasteful things we do must be  fundamentally reengineered (air travel) or go bye-bye. 

Mother Nature bats last."
"Jason Stevenson","2022-02-04T18:36:02Z","@Ian Carolan The science doesn't care about per capita. Plus we are told wind and solar are supposed to be cheaper than coal? So why should the west have to put their hands in their pockets meanwhile allow developing nations to keep building coal plants until 2030?? 
The rise from 1.2C to 3C warming won't be driven by developed countries. 
China's per capita wealth is largely as result of their political system that keeps the masses poor (communism) and wind and solar can't deliver the needed dispatchable power its as simple as that. China also has 400km/h trains, near worlds best telecommunications and is rapidly expanding its military including nuclear arsenal. 
Meanwhile Germany closes its nuclear plants over a tsunami in Japan and a wind drought in Europe causes panic. They can't be taken seriously on the threat suggested in this video by their actions."

The 1920s-1930 should be hotter and the 1960s-1970s should be much cooler and the 2000s-2020s much cooler. The IPCC, NASA and NOAA all have published reports during the 1990s that show *radically different data* to what they started publishing from 2001.
Pre-Industrial Era we were going through a cooling climate. So we are measuring from a recent low. Prior to that period temperatures were higher. 
Cite a source for the 7x increase in Extreme Weather events. So far extreme weather events on land are decreasing. Overall they are increasing because historically we couldn't see extreme weather events that were not over populated areas but we can now with Satellite coverage. 
Deaths from extreme weather events and other natural disasters are down 90% over the last 100 years even while the global population increased 300%.
Over the last 8,000 years sea levels have risen about 10m. Over the preceding 8,000 years they rose about 100m. There is nothing untoward about current sea level changes. Over the 80years we are likely to see 20cm of sea level rise.

Herds.  From the age of the dinosaurs to todays fish in the seas, birds in the air and past buffalo, elephants and the like it appears she favors large masses, agglomerations,  of biological entities.  

So humanity is her latest experiment in the architype.  This time she's created an intelligent herd.  

But as bright as we are, as intelligent as we appear to be, in a group context we don't seem especially wise.  In a group setting we are the exact opposite of those past herds who accepted and lived within the constraints of their environment.  

In fact we seem prone to irrational acts of folly.  Stupidity, self-interest, avarice and greed, is our norm in large groups.  A not especially evolutionarily attractive trait in a species.  So the experiment, overall, seems now to be in jeopardy.

It comes to this.  We either learn to control ourselves and our numbers, acknowledging that as big as this planet is it is, in fact, a Terrarium.  A closed loop dynamic system with limits.  We either understand this and begin to comport ourselves along those informed lines, or Mother Nature will do it for us.  

Given her tendency she will not care how much we scream about what she does.  Our sensibilities aren't hers.  She will reduce our numbers for us.  

But for now we still have the choice.  We have the option for self-control.  We can reign ourselves in.  Or not.

So choose wisely my primate friends.  Choose wisely.  The future awaits what we do today.

"Martian Soon","2021-10-31T10:37:18Z","3C means lot more rain instead of snow.

3C global warming on snowy areas means 2-4 times more heating, so 6-12C more heat specially during autumn and fall, but also some additional heating during winter and summer. We are already seeing that wintertime is shrinking from both ends. 3C will reduce snow and ice cover a lot more even in a pitch black winter day.

Also in the same time polar ice caps melts, polar vortex is lost, arctic sea ice cover is lost and loads more humidity is in the air causing blizzards that are stronger than we have ever seen.

And in the Mediterranean & USA this means droughts that are worse than ever before. Desertification starts really happening at that point. 6th mass extinction is causing extinction level impact for 1 million species or loads more. We can see extinctions have started on 1C by losing 50% of our coral reefs. Species are travelling toward colder conditions, but many can't move fast enough or is blocked by manmade barriers.

3,0C is where we are heading even if we can agree making rapid emission cuts. Why? Current models are missing two key elements: tipping points (like Amazon turned to carbon source) and army emissions. We are currently about 10% over emissions that are predicted for worst case scenario... And our leaders are still not doing what is necessary. Ie. China announced its emission plan: peak in 2030 and net zero by 2060 means we will overshoot even unrealistic IPCC's 2C targets.

Because it's not that we can't do better, especially when we see the harm and impact of that which we do.  It's that we chose to follow a path based on the immediacy of profit now over any sort of sustainable longevity.  We're like children gobbling that piece of candy, not waiting for a future bit of sweetness.

Like I said; we're not especially wise, are we?  At least, not based on the expression of our current (moral) character.  

But like I also said, it doesn't matter.  Mother Nature will decide for us.  This Terrarium within which we live?  It is one with active, implacable and dynamic systems.  Systems that strive for one thing, as all terrarium's do.  Balance.  

We primates have been merrily pumping huge amounts of energy into those systems via carbon, etc..  And those systems, slow though they may be now begin to react.  Seeking balance.  I assure you of this; balance they will attain.  

The only issue is how much we'll be liking any new norm.  I suspect we won't, much.

That is a rise of water level. Then it melts taking up the same volume. When this water warms it also expands causing more sea level rise. The converse is true too. During ice ages, sea levels drop, exposing land bridges and more land."

"peter jones","2022-01-27T14:29:46Z","@Jc Mostly the oceans.
Next to carbonate rock deposits, the oceans are the largest Co2 sink.
As the upper ocean levels warm they cannot hold as much Co2 in solution and so its outgassed into the atmosphere.
Its a bit like water vapor in the atmosphere as temperatures cool water condenses out because the atmosphere cant hold it, you can pump more water into the atmosphere but it remains vapor and is condensing as mist.
This is why Co2 levels continue to rise after temperature has cooled, the oceans hold heat longer than the atmosphere.
Thats not to say it accumulates in the atmosphere the turnover of Co2 is ten years or less based on 1960's USAF nuclear air sampling programmes, 
so its being outgassed and reabsorbed but the outgassing exceeds the re absorbtion overall.
The Co2 lag is thought to be from ocean turnover , its likely that some of our Co2 rise is from the Medieval warming.
Higher Co2 levels in the atmosphere NEVER prevent subsequent cooling.
Remember the more Co2 in the atmosphere the LESS additional warming it produces and that effect is logarithmic NOT linear.
Co2 produces its greatest warming effect at 20 ppm with every doubling of Co2 levels the warming is smaller and smaller, at 415 ppm you could double the concentration without significant warming.
We have had massive ice ages on the planet with 4000 ppm + Co2 and high temperatures with very low Co2 levels.
The paleoclimate data shows that Co2 levels have VERY POOR correlation with temperature cycles but solar variability has VERY HIGH correlation with the temperature cycles.
Russian and Finnish and U.K studies indicate the ECS is ACTUALLY .24 deg C at current Co2 levels, the human contribution to that is .01-.02 Deg C.
Its not what i think the paleoclimate data is quite clear.
Human Co2 emissions are LESS than 4% of the annual Co2 output, the vast majority of the Co2 rise in the atmosphere has come from the oceans.
The other sources are rather minor compared to the ocean.
By the way current estimates of past Co2 levels are taken from ice cores, while they provide a useful continuity they are only ESTIMATES of AVERAGES over time usually thousands of years, this removes the peaks and troughs from the record, additionally Russian research indicated Co2 leaches from ice under pressure, so the ice core samples are of limited usefulness in determining spot levels of maximum Co2 at any time.
We do have a few very accurate Co2 spot levels from the last 11000 years in the form of fossil leaf stomata counts , we have counts from the Holocene showing minimum levels of 500 ppm.
This NEVER seems to be ever mentioned, certainly not in the IPCC scientific reports.
Hope that helps."

I get it, you don't want to read what I said; that's fine, I can definitely sympathise with that, and you don't have to. But I'm not going to reply further, because you aren't even paying attention to what I am saying, so why should I do the same for you? 

You think ONE scientist is responsible for the published temperature measurements at NASA? Do you have any idea how _many_ climatologists work for nasa? One person couldn't falsify every output of NASA in the field of meteorology. That's literally impossible. Not only that, but James Hansen retired from NASA in 2013. I told you already that your information is out of date, I can do nothing further unless you choose yourself to seek updated information.

I already said that the current temperatures and the medieval warming and roman warming have been compared and that the warming in the Roman period and in the medieval period were less than the last 3 decades, and that they were localized, and that the temperature actually went down in the pacific in the same period. You again, didn't read what I wrote, did you?

I did not ignore the reality of cooling between 1940 and 1977, I LITERALLY just talked about it and explained to you how it was irrelevant because it didn't drop below the years previous to 1930, so it was the wobble shifting upward, and overall those decades were still warmer than all those prior to 1930 in the history of observational measurments. Did you read what I said at all?

I'm done here if you're not going to read what I say, I'm wasting my time and so are you. Let's part ways politely, and I wish you all the best."

"Tiny Town Software","2021-10-31T15:25:45Z","@Wolf Heathen ‚ô™ Exactly. CO2 concentrations in the past have been in the thousands of ppm and the earth survived just fine. They conveniently don't mention this. We are now at ~400ppm. Preindustrial was ~200. Below 200 plant life slows. Below 100 plant life starts dying as there is not enough CO2 for proper cell biology."
"Wolf Heathen ‚ô™","2021-10-31T12:50:01Z","If this video was true, the Earth would've been a burning hellscape millions of years ago which we know it wasn't. Life was thriving on this planet when it was 7 degrees warmer than it is now. Add to that, the polar ice caps have only existed for ~15 million years and a total of ~50 million years over the past 500 million years. Earth with polar ice caps is the exception, not the rule.

We're at the end tail of an ice age that swept over the northern hemisphere 10 000 years ago. This means that the climate has been getting warmer since then, ice caps are melting, and floods occur at an increase rate. The assumption that this is somewhow strange is nothing short of moronic, unless you only look at climate a few decades or centuries back.

When it comes to climate models, there are two major problems: not only do they not take ancient climate into consideration (such as previous post-ice age climate) or sun spot activity (the sun effectively being the massive nuclear radiator in the sky heating up everything in the solar system), but the scientists using them have gone into this field because they want to do something about climate change. They have a pre-existing idea of what the climate models should show, which means that as soon as their models show something different they assume there's something wrong with the modelsthemselves and will therefor change the parameters accordingly until they show what said sicentists think they should show. Bias has completely destroyed the entire field of mainstream climate research."

If battery technology caught up with energy demand it wouldn't just be individual households that could stay off the grid 24 hours but industry and commerce too. As for getting that desalinized water to where it's needed you don't truck it but rather build pipeline and (using solar) use pumping stations to move it to higher elevations to dams and hydro plants where it can again flow back down rivers helping irrigate farms and eventually to sea level. Solar isn't the only option - wind generation is another possibility that clearly isn't being used enough on small scale.

O community of non Arabs and the Arabs, surely the planet of chastisement has approached, so where is the escape?! Indeed, the evidence of its extreme approach in the news of the grand Quran is that coronavirus invades the world from where they do not know its biological origin to the fact it did not come from the biological nature, rather (it is) a challenge from (Allah) Lord of the worlds; descendants of some Ba-ooda; tiniest creature of which you do not encompass knowledge yet in order for you to know that you do not encompass about a thing from His knowledge except what Allah pleases, glory be to Him ‚Äî and it is from the minor chastisement, thus there is in it wisdom in order to stop the world‚Äôs wheel of life initially including their factory for many months, then Allah would raise the level of climate war; floods, striking mountainous hail divides into deadly shrapnels, drowning hurricanes, tornado of burning fire at forest parks, volcanoes, earthquake, and the entire sorts of Allah‚Äôs climate war by the minor chastisement before the the major chastisement for you may return to Allah! And we fully explained that in detail since a long time ago before the events, surely there is no need to repeat. 

Perhaps one of the questioners would like to say: ‚ÄúOh our Allah, yes indeed the coronavirus came at the year end of 2019 and the whole world been quarantined at the beginning of year 2020, and we said perhaps a harmful thing is beneficial, and we thought that coronavirus is the solution for the global warming problem that Paris convention was unable to solve it, to the fact it halted factories and movement of vehicles, trains, air-crafts and ships, and we were certain that it will definitely reduce the climate disasters because of the reduction of emission of carbon dioxide (pollution) so we said indeed coronavirus solved the problem that the agreement of Paris could not solve it, that the later was requesting fifty percent reduction for several months, yet implementing it was not accomplished due the countries‚Äô (leaders) fear the harm over their economy, and corona came then it stopped the carbon emissions by the rate of fifty percent for several months, and we thought that definitely it will reduce the climate disasters but we got surprised by the opposite! Instead of reducing the climate disasters the opposite occurred to what we expected, in fact, the level of climate war was raised; floods, hurricanes and climate disasters were unprecedented in most places of the world. Coronavirus shattered the theory of global warming due to the fact that the Paris agreement was not implemented as they agreed on stopping fifty percent of the factories‚Äô emissions, but coronavirus stopped it a hundred percent for several months because of the quarantines and overall shutdown. But the level of climate disasters has risen in unprecedented form since the year 2020 and our current year 2021. Surely, theory of global warming has failed. 


‚ÄúO Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, surely, your explanatory-statements in various fields where its ratification comes upon the actual reality, and who follows your explanatory-statements knows this since more than sixteen years ago while you deny and disbelieve in the global warming theory and you say: In fact it is (Saqar) planet of fire approaching near the earth of humans. So its impact on planet earth began while it is still at a distant place away from it, and you have many explanatory-statements about it yet we did not believe you, in fact we believed the global warming theory. But the global warming theory ended up failing, so can you deduce for us from from the grand Quran that coronavirus was sent by Allah to ratify your fatwa to crush the global warming theory because to will force us stopping our factories and wheel of the carbon life (pollution) for many month, so Allah would raise (level) of the unprecedented climate war in order to crush the global warming theory?‚Äù Then we reply to the questioner and I say: You would find the news in the word of Allah the Most High: {And those who reject Our messages ‚Äî We lead them (to destruction) step by step from whence they know not.(182) And I grant them respite. Surely My scheme is effective.(183) Do they not reflect (that) there is no madness in their companion? He is only a plain warner.(184) Do they not see the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what things Allah has created, and that it may be that their doom has drawn nigh? In what announcement after this will they then believe?(185) Whomsoever Allah leaves in error, there is no guide for him. And He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.(186)}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-A`ar√£f] 7:182-186 

While you till now are not able to know from where Allah invaded you with coronavirus, and it accomplished its mission successfully, it halted your factories, your vehicles, your air-crafts, and your ships for several months to reduce emissions into the atmosphere. Then Allah raised the level of His climate war for you to know that global warming theory is incorrect, then you look at what is around you in the kingdom of the solar system, definitely you would find it abnormal altogether with whatever in it (including) the sun because of an upcoming hidden thing disrupting it! In fact, it will affect everything Allah created in the solar system. Surely, the solar system has no ability to resist the major calamity, that‚Äôs planet Saqar, that‚Äôs what you call it planet Nibiru. In fact, your doom approached on the night of its passage in the earth‚Äôs sky of the humans, so is there who will have in mind? So ponder over the news in Allah‚Äôs Book the grand Quran. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {And those who reject Our messages ‚Äî We lead them (to destruction) step by step from whence they know not.(182) And I grant them respite. Surely My scheme is effective.(183) Do they not reflect (that) there is no madness in their companion?

This is conclusive evidence that planet Saqar which you call it planet Nibiru has truly approached, and because of its approach your doom has approached on the night of its passage in your earth‚Äôs sky. In fact; the evidence for its approach; you find it affecting the entire planets of the solar system with its entire planets, moons, asteroids, orbits, movements and its heavenly corners, because the effect in the Reminder‚Äôs news is comprehensive; you would recognize it includes everything Allah created around you in the kingdom of the solar system through the word of Allah the Most High: {Do they not see the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what things Allah has created, and that it may be that their doom has drawn nigh?

Let's talk about ocean acidification.
The music in carbon binding and oxygene production plays in the oceans, not at land.

We could breath without trees, but not without phytoplancton, that produces over 75% of the global oxygene. And binds over 75% of the carbon dioxyde into organic mass. These organisms as well as coral reefs and diatoms, are endangered by carbon acid, CO2 in H2O.

How did the CO2 get into the oceans?
By the cooler water temperatures of the current ice-age, as cool water can absorb far mor gases as warm water.

When will the CO2 gas leave the oceans, again?
With the warmer water temperatures at the end off the ice-age.

When is the current ice-age over?
The current ice-age (that started around 30 millions years ago) is officially over, when both poles, arctic and antarctic, melt once a year away."

"John Dooley","2021-10-31T09:49:55Z","Ireland was traditionally a forest of deciduous hardwoods. Oak, Ash and sycamore and elm as such like trees. Now most of our forestry is Sitka spruce, fast growing and profitable in 20 years as opposed to 40-50 years for hardwoods. A multigenerational finance system is needed at government level to pay forestry workers a wage now for hardwoods which might take 50 years to give a return. This cannot be done at family level like other farm enterprises such as animal or crop production. 
Our forestry companies using spruce and such softwoods cause environmental damage because when the forests are cleared this results in rapid water release in heavy rain storms, deciduous hold onto water runoff for longer and have better support for native wildlife and are better for the environment.
The solution to this problem will take a long time due to divisive interests and short-term financial thinking among a lot of the stakeholders concerned."

People who live by the equator, are already suffering from massive storms and droughts. By the end of the century my home island will likely loss much of it's current coastline forcing us to either move to the mainland or further inland. Due to droughts and soil erosion we know agriculture will become very difficult.

Governments in the North don't see global warming in the same way as shown by Trump's tirades and American apathetic views to the concerns of us in the Global South. So many countries in the global North will suffer, but because of their wealth, location and racist attitudes will insure their survival first and foremost. We already see how the wealthier nations have no intention of honoring their promises in helping the poorer countries.  All their so called commitments these past 20 years have been a joke, and they have shown their true colors repeatedly. Europeans and Americans are addicted to oil, they are addicted to their lifestyles and are unable and unwilling to adapt their dietary, economic lifestyles, and their social commitments to insure mutual survival for all of humanity. 

My position has been clear and I don't have much hope for the future. My people may very well have to migrate to the mainland by the millions. USA will have to find a place for so many Puerto Ricans.

Wind and solar will never replace the volume of electricity generated by coal plants.

How can anyone take climate change seriously? It's about as serious as that guys beard. It's just fear mongering. By the rate we're going, it's unlikely we'll even add 0.01% more CO2 in this century.

You see... you are right that the sun is the source of more or less of the surface temperature of earth and you are also right, that this temperature is a function of the distance between earth and the sun. given the energy output of the sun and making some simplifications, like a perfect circular orbit around the sun and a perfect circular surface of the sun, then you can calculate with the help of Stefan-Boltzman law the temperature of earth! 278¬∞Kelvin in average. the differences caused by the simplifications are tiny ... we are talking here about a few percent.  

now to your conclusion you see. the current average temperature is not 278¬∞Klevin... its more 288¬∞Kelvin, and rising... do you know why that is?"

"RussCR5187","2021-10-31T16:25:58Z","@John Russell I experienced the same in Michigan.  Here's how I now think about it.  We as a species settled in northern latitudes where bouts of a particular kind of extreme weather were more or less expected and could be adapted to and tolerated.  We planted crops where food production remained viable in spite of the weather hiccups.  The cold winters kept certain kinds of pests at bay (e.g., pine bark beetles).  And so on.

Global heating is causing us to have to tolerate different kinds of extreme weather.  Now our crops have to deal with the change of seasons coming at different times than before.  They must tolerate floods or droughts during the growing season, instead of cold snaps during the dormant season.  They must tolerate different pests-- ones that thrive in a generally warmer climate.

So ... what does all this change imply for the future?  I believe that if global heating continues apace the new extremes will become even more extreme.  For example, warmer air can hold more moisture, so a warmer rainstorm can drop more water and floods can become worse.  A point might be reached where worsening heat waves become intolerable and people have to migrate away from places like the Middle East, where living conditions are already marginal.  Prolonged droughts or too-frequent flooding could make food production untenable in a particular region and people will have to migrate away.  This is already happening in certain South American regions.

In other words, I think what we have experienced in our lifetimes can legitimately be seen as a warning signal.  We don't want global average temperatures to keep going up.  Our climate will become more unstable and weather extremes could continue to worsen."
"John Russell","2021-10-31T15:37:51Z","Yes, when I was a kid in the 1960s we had extreme weather‚Äîheavy snow that brought everything to a standstill, including school, for days. Today we hardly see snow in winter but instead we have extreme rain leading to flooding. The difference is called, unsurprisingly, 'climate change'."

"boxwoodgreen","2021-11-01T13:50:35Z","@John Dooley The majority of the fires are arson. Also many of the forests were deliberately over-planted  for tourist ""vista sightseeing""  reasons, especially in Federal and state parks. Multiplying the forest floor flammable detritus problem. The drought cycles are thoroughly documented as a long term cycle occurring long before the modern era."
"John Dooley","2021-10-31T20:43:12Z","A lot of these fires are caused by building close to forests without firebreaks and proper management of vegetation through proper coppiceing and using the woodlands in a proper way. The zealots of the green movement will not allow ANY trees to be cut down or any proper woodland management in the vicinity of permanent human habitation. This is a fatal mistake especially when most of your housing stock is wooden, single storey units in sparsely settled towns.

They have no choice to choose a different provider that might be cheaper and a better service but when it is a few companies running things it is also a monopoly or duopoly so not a free market where small businesses can compete. Small companies are forced to innovate and there is healthy competition. This is why I use different terms capitalism and corperatism. The conservatives are not really capitalists but they say they are but they are in bed with big business, so monoplies are created which start to collapse. Then Labour steps in and says we have nationalise which works for a while but also collapses because it is also a monopoly. But people believe in this false left right parradigm, but I think its a false choice of pepsi or coke illusion of choice, doesnt make the people free"
"Kris Brooks","2021-10-31T22:59:43Z","@Tobias Stevens no I don't think what you say. So I go to a butcher in my town, he is a small business, so if capitalism is corperations, how do we classify him? With your reasoning we have to say his business is a corperations and a greedy capitalist. So how do we encourage small business and not big corperations? I suggest that we don't encorage large government that does deals with big busness and rigs the game fir them. My dad used to have a book shop and they got rid of the net book agreement so now books can be sold at any price so big companies undercut. The government took that away or big busness lobying government depending on how you look at it. Governemnt wont break up these corperations so they dont represent the people. The solution is less tax so people can choose how to spend their money and government is small. Communists = big government and Naxi = big government. The founding of the US was small government."
"Tobias Stevens","2021-10-31T22:39:39Z","@Kris Brooks The country is run by corporations. Which is a consequence of capitalism. If you think communism is where corporations run the state, you might want to do a little more studying."
"Kris Brooks","2021-10-31T21:11:56Z","@Tobias Stevens no you're wrong, we are not in a capitalist system because its corperatism, so theres no free market.

"Rudl Za Vedno","2021-10-30T22:47:41Z","Lots of scientist are talking about it, one of the more vocal ones are prof Tim Garrett & co with their ""growth as a symptom"" hypothesis. They treat civilization like a ‚Äúheat engine‚Äù that ‚Äúconsumes energy and does 'work' in the form of economic production, which then spurs it to consume more energy.‚Äù Their study came to two surprising conclusions. First, although improving efficiency through innovation is a hallmark of efforts to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, efficiency has the side effect of making it easier for civilization to grow and consume more. Second, that the current rates of world population growth may not be the cause of rising rates of energy consumption, but a symptom of past efficiency gains.

""Advocates of energy efficiency for climate change mitigation may seem to have a reasonable point,"" Garrett says, ""but their argument only works if civilization maintains a fixed size, which it doesn't. Instead, an efficient civilization is able to grow faster. It can more effectively use available energy resources to make more of everything, including people. Expansion of civilization accelerates rather than declines, and so do its energy demands and CO2 emissions.""

I'm sure humanity will cling on for many more generations, but in what shape will we be? As our world deteriorates in every way, we will slowly lose any sense of hope and optimism for the future. What will children dream of in 2100? I still find it incomprehensible that many politicians and of course fossil fuel execs believe that this hellish vision for possibly the only intelligent life in the universe, is worth trading off for a few more years of profits before they are finally forced to admit that they are sitting on stranded assets.

"Nicky Mitchell","2021-10-30T13:37:49Z","Here‚Äôs a way to stop üõë warming of three degrees: it‚Äôs called ‚Äòsolar radiation management‚Äô or ‚Äòstratospheric aerosol injection‚Äô. The idea üí° of flying high-altitude aircraft in the stratosphere ejecting ‚èèÔ∏è the same dust particles that volcanoes üåã emit. 

Mount Pinatubo üåã in the Philippines üáµüá≠ was the largest volcanic üåã explosion üí• of the 20th century. In 1991 it spewed out a huge gas cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è that spread around the globe üåé. Whilst the volcano üåã caused lots of local damage but the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è itself did something extraordinary: it lowered the earth‚Äôs üåç temperature. Sulphur dioxide in that said gas cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è in effect, generated particles that acted as small mirrors ü™û reflecting a fair percentage of sunlight back into space. The amazing ü§© thing is that scientists üë©‚Äçüî¨ are thinking üí≠ of mimicking that effect to counter global heating. How about exaggerating this:

Let‚Äôs have a situation like üëç in the movie üé• ‚ÄòSnowpiercer‚Äô where an attempt to do this resulted in an ice üßä age. Let‚Äôs add about 500 times as much sulphur dioxide, calcium carbonate and table salt üßÇ into earth‚Äôs üåç stratosphere as carbon dioxide every year until the year 4000 A.D., All governments implementing this. If Mount Pinatubo üåã cooled the earth üåç by as much as 0.5-1C for at least 2-3 years, just think üí≠ how much the planet üåé would cool üòé if we released high-altitude balloons üéà full of said dust particles, flew high-altitude aircraft with nozzles attached to them that are constantly blasting out sulphur dioxide particles, calcium carbonate and table salt üßÇ every year until 4000 A.D. The global average temperature could drop 13C for all I care. That‚Äôd give a 3-degree warming one ‚òùÔ∏è blaze of a beating. I hope ü§û that we implement this, I don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if it backfires.

To take out all that carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, let‚Äôs build a huge ‚Äòdirect air capture‚Äô machine that has 1,000,000 units that‚Äôs thrice as high as the Burj Khalifa somewhere in the United States üá∫üá∏ and to further cool üòé the planet üåé, whilst at the same time, providing all our green energy needs, we could cover much of the Sahara Desert üèú with solar panels and solar dishes to provide all of Europe and Africa with plentiful green electricity ‚ö°Ô∏è. All those countries that still rely on burning coal for energy can switch to wind üå¨ and solar and build 150 nuclear ‚ò¢Ô∏è reactors.

Give it to me, baby!"

Many scientists question this shoddy malpractice and the misinformation being held out.  Yes temperatures have risen since the 80s about 1/3 of what we are told.  Before this the world cooled between 1943 and 1979 when a looming ice age was the cry.  We are now getting massive fuel poverty in the UK as COP26 occurs.

We don't know what's optimal, but we do know with some assurance that the conditions we have at present constitute ecological overshoot.  That is, we have exceeded the sustainable carrying capacity of planet Earth.  How do we know?  By the fact that many aspects of the biosphere that we depend on are, by actual measurement, either being depleted (e.g., aquifers, sea life, soil) or overloaded with waste products (e.g., CO2, fertilizers) at rates faster than nature can restore.  Something that can't continue forever ... won't.

Anyhow, the consensus about Earth-centrism was dogmatic and greatly rooted in religious thought and upheld by church. The birth of scientific evidence & experiment based method was in its infancy during the time and the Earth-centrists were threatening these first ""modern scientists"" as heretics.

The matter was investigated by the¬†Roman Inquisition¬†in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish, absurd, and heretical since it contradicted Holy Scripture.[9][10][11]

Galileo later defended his views in¬†Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems¬†(1632), which appeared to attack¬†Pope Urban VIII¬†and thus alienated both the Pope and the¬†Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point.[9]¬†He was tried by the Inquisition, found ""vehemently suspect of heresy"", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[12][13]¬†During this time, he wrote¬†Two New Sciences¬†(1638), primarily concerning¬†kinematics¬†and the¬†strength of materials, summarizing work he had done around forty years earlier."""

But if you‚Äôre about to roll up your sleeve for a 3rd jab in one year with an eye on a 4th, then I‚Äôm not really sure what you‚Äôre on about as it was. So would I be correct in thinking that you fully trust the WHO (World Health Organization) and their organization VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). That wouldn't be tinfoil hat information now would it?"

"David Murphy","2021-10-30T16:43:49Z","@Iron Maiden Come on, stop beating about the bush and tell us about the lizardmen. Also, any tips on 5G? I hear tinfoil just isn't cutting it these days."

"Carlos Eduardo Bernini Kapins","2021-10-30T12:10:34Z","@Merry Machiavelli even with the projections of UN, we are still getting older and pursuing wealth. This lead to more consumption of the natural resources, more food, more devastating areas, etc‚Ä¶. it is all connected and must be also be in the center of the conversation. We are trying to change fossil fuels, but to support our growing wealthy population we need more energy, more energy of all kinds (food, electricity, goods) more destruction‚Ä¶
Even renewable resources destroys the environment‚Ä¶. It is not an easy problem and if we keep up growing as world population‚Ä¶. Even just one continent, we cannot support 10bi wealthy people‚Ä¶. Maybe that‚Äôs not the question for politicians to do, as they need the vote‚Ä¶. So they don‚Äôt put into the table‚Ä¶. Just think about it‚Ä¶. And try to imagine if the world can support it‚Ä¶. If you still thinks not I will consider it‚Ä¶. But don‚Äôt trust too much in projections‚Ä¶ take it in consideration but ask always why they pull it off"
"Merry Machiavelli","2021-10-30T11:32:05Z","Population growth is not the main cause of the problem anymore. Population growth is slowing, and the global population will mostly level off by mid-century, according to UN projections. The only continent with population that will see significant growth this century is Africa, and they aren't the main causes of the problem (although development may effect things), the countries that do emit a lot per capita are mostly set to see their populations fall or be sustained only by migration this century. It would still be helpful if there weren't so many humans in the world, the whole 'breeding ourselves into extinction' idea is a bit outdated."

What if its just fear being peddled by these marxists in order to get us to lower our standards of living so they can be right? Gore said thered b no ice by 2000 in The artic. That NY would b underwater by 2014 ish. Truth is white ppl cant stand the heat so they makes us all scared."

If you‚Äôre paying attention the road signs stretch behind us. You drive across this country in the XXIst and your car will not be covered in dead bugs and it‚Äôs rare to hit a bird‚Ä¶ yet, when I grew up the swarms were thick everywhere and you had to clear off headlamps and windshields when you fueled up. It was a gross and annoying part of summers and I miss all the birds that used to sing after eating those bugs: the birds are going.  We will follow, because we cannot live without the other critters and won‚Äôt last drinking Tang and eating aging packaged food in a bunker. We are in the Sixth Greatest Extinction of all Earth history and our corporate money-at-all-costs agenda IS the key motivating factor driving psychopathic institutional behavior. The March of Folly as described by Barbara Tuchman shows various civilizations‚Äô fall and the obsessions that doomed them, and ours is money.
Funny thing is this: you saw the clip and tapped. You were motivated to comment. Your denial is noted. See you on the other side. 
I hope your grandchildren make it."
