"Sensei Kurt: International Body-Guard - Realtor in Sonoma County, CA","2023-02-10T18:49:47Z","Is CO2 Earth's Thermostat?  

Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm, which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds, and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible! 
Also, bear in mind, that water vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5% of the earth's CHG. Water vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.   
Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas. Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate. 
Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat!"

"S N","2023-01-29T10:45:39Z","do you have any clue where OXYGEN comes from?

Oxygen...(you know, that stuff that literally every living creature that's not a plant requires to keep living from one minute to the next?)...Oxygen comes from PLANTS.
Do you know what Plants Breath?
Plants Breath CO2.  And then they exhale Oxygen.

This nonsense about ""co2 is building up in the atmosphere"" is the most ridiculously stupid thing I've literally ever heard.

Plants inhale CO2.  Which means that the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the faster and healthier plants will grow, breathing in all that delicious CO2, taking it out of the atmosphere, and turning it into rich, delicious OXYGEN.  And Oxygen...is NOT a ""greenhouse gas"".  But it IS essential to literally all life on the planet.  So is CO2 ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET, And it is essential to have CO2 in massive abundance, just like oxygen.

More CO2 = more and healthier and faster growing plants, (like FOOD for all you idiot vegans out there, Trees, Algae, etc) = LESS CO2 = MORE OXYGEN = healthier and happier ""literally all other life forms"".

The fact is we are in a state of dangerously LOW CO2 in the atmosphere.

more CO2 = More Oxygen

Not enough CO2 = literally the extinction of every living organism on the planet.

Didn't the climate cultists say the coastal cities would be underwater back then by the year 2000? Here we are 22 years later and no where close to it. Though there are some truths to global warming but way way way overblown by climate cultists.  Anyways we need to get rid of coal and more clean refining methods for oil and natural gas, but this whole obsession to completely get rid of all fossil fuels and ban all in existence and force everyone into electric cars that have half battery and degradation and long charge times and actually are much more toxic to the environment to produce than any gas car is a fear tactic and a threat to our rights!!!

Leave us gas car, furnace, ovens, stoves, and dryer owners alone and get all power companies on 100% clean energy for power going to house. And how about no electric cars. That way all power companies have 100% clean energy and can sustain it and no overloading the grid with the insane amount of power to charge electric cars. That way no affect at all to the individual consumer as they get their power to their home the same as before and can drive the kind of car they want and operate the appliances they want through good old electricity just clean on the back end. But can still use the same type of cars and appliances running in gas as well thus no change as well as have reasonable gas prices at the pump.

I will not put up with climate cultists telling me what kind of car or stove, furnace or dryers to have!! But feel free to force power companies to use as much clean energy to delivery electricity as you want as well as ban coal completely as no individual consumer uses anything directly powered by coal."

 we see we are having these Co² issues for the last decades because of massive emittions of power supply of all countries in the world because of the faster growth of techonlogy and population and the demand of power supply in increasing each year, but if we can discipline our self to reduce the energy consumption it might sound controling people but hear me out, at our home we don't really need to rely on electricity for example at our homes we just simply unplug unessesary device or appliances to grealty reduce the electricity bills and at the sametime we can help to reduce the Co² emmitons in short ways we need to analyze the electricity consumption in our homes to reduce it as far as possible we get to the point that we can save energy and at the sametime a money right?

and we know that rich people houses are the ones who consume massive amounts of energy simply because almost all of their appliances are all working on electricity but we can't stop them theyre rich tho so we can't do anything about it but with a good advices from each of our governments and enough information that they can anounce to us on advertisment or local door to door information papers to read by each household to aware us about Green house effect together we can reduce the amount of Co² emmitions to normal rates instead of fighting who's right or wrong why would we just work together to massively reduce the electicity consumption.

in conclusion as we know we can't simply remove fossil fuels power plants to massively reduce the co² emittions but we can take control by every little move and dicipline on energy demand in little ways so it can have massive impact of reducing this Global warming effect that we currently facing at as human species

And so are you.

Too bad the ORIGINAL scientist who theorized and predicted “climate change” was in 1896(ish) and was Swedish, named Svante Arrhenius.

Too bad also, is the FACT that each and EVERY prediction has been WRONG.

Too bad also is the fact that MORE pollution has been released than they “predicted” and STILL non of the disaster (effects) have taken place. None.

The environment , our personal responsibility and effect we have via pollution IS important.

Most of the statistic are exactly that, cherry picked to fit a narrative.

“60%” of species alive will die if we continue.  WEIRD, as how anthropologist (who know about animal life on earth )… already said we lost 90-92% of all life to extinction PRIOR to humans even existing.

Too bad tropical regions, were NOT tropical years before, and will naturally shift to not being tropical (an estimated 5x already) in earth existence.

So it’s hard to see the concern… when it’s so big we cannot not have ever effected it.

Coral reefs grow at 2-5cm per year…. Hawaii (as an example) is growing at 7cm per year.  Hawaii will NATURALLY KILL (overgrow) it’s reefs…. Yet that’s natural and okay.  But if we kill reefs… it’s unnatural.

I know, I know, it’ll take Hawaii thousands of years, yes, true.  Yet my point remains.

We need to refocus our goals BACK down to local, relatable environment and pollution…. Vs WORLD CLIMATE.

You don’t teach children physics, you actuate their ability to later LEARN physics by teaching 1+1 = 2.

Start small.
Start relatable.

And don’t catastrophize….  The worst in life RARELY EVER happens.  What does happen is people make manageable things seem far worse than they are. This turns everyone off."

There is no evidence that oil is made from dinosaur biomass, indeed it seems like oil is more and more a renewable resource and requires us to just not pump it out of the Earth so quickly. Enough! Apocalyptical thinking and crisis based actions will just cause human stress and make everyone crazy. Lets take an adult attitude and move forward on this issue without alarmism."

Even 1,200 ppm of CO2 would not even be a problem because it's been that high in Earth's past by evidence of ice core sample using SCIENCE. Even at 1200 ppm of CO2, the global temp did not go anywhere near current predictions nor did life lead to Earth's demise when CO2 was near 1200 ppm and the ocean did not rise to the levels predicted today. IPCC are guesses and bad guesses, and 97% is a consensus is not the scientific method. When discussing quantum mechanics, do you EVER read that X% of physicists agree in a consensus? It is either proven true with tests after test, or it is FALSE. ONE test can make a hypothesis FALSE and you start over. Science doesn't do a POLL to decide 'well a big majority agrees, so it must be true', no they TEST the hypothesis and unless every test proves it true does it become a proven THEORY.

"Mark Pawelek","2022-10-12T16:31:51Z","This video is a lie. Exxon scientists did not invent the myth that buring fossil fuels cause ""climate change"". This idea originated in the 19th century with Svante Arrhenius following on from Joseph Fourier and John Tyndall. After Arrhenius the idea vanished for 40 years until a British railway engineer revived it. The idea was rejigged in its current (mathematical modelling) form by Gilbert Plass in the 1950s. His modelling methods were modified in the 1960s, '70s and '80s by several ""scientists"" (AKA armchair modellers - not actual scientists), over more than 20 years, such as Syukuro Manabe, Richard Wetherald, James Hansen culminating in a 2000 paper by Isaac Held and Brian Soden; which hasn't been changed much since. Many of the people who developed these models were trained in atmospheric physics. So 45 yeaars of mathematical/computer modelling and ""Theory"" (AKA speculation) are behind this man-made climate myth.

The scientists at Exxon were NOT climate scientists - they would've been geologists. The climate of earth is more than geoology and atmospheric physics. Climate sciences now involve 9, or so distinct sciences and disciplines: geology, atmospheric physics, Paleontology, Paleo-climatology , oceanograthy, meteorology, solar physics, astronomy, mathematical modelling. Because, contrary to what media ram into our heads, earth's climate is a complex thing. The atmospheric physicists and modellers who invented the greenhouse gas effect played upon this compelexity (too hard for hoi polloi to ken) to reduce everything to slogans the masses would understand and buy. Not saying they planned it that way, the the mill-machine of politics, media forced it down that route.

When Exxon scientists researched the majority of scientists working in climate fields disagreed with them. So if they were reluctant to publish maybe that was because they didn't want to sound like idiots?  Al Gore took the idea up after being exposed to it at a university lecture he attended. The IPCC was created to ONLY research man-made climate change, and told to find the evidence for it. 34 years later and they still have no good scientific evidence; but they get lots of funding and keep their cushy jobs in academia playing with their supercomputers; so what do they care about science and truth when they're paid to lie? Gore himself made sure that ONLY true believers in man-made climate got any government grants at all to study science. Yet despite the US government attempts to kill actual climate science (to replace it with group think) there are still many scientists today (more in Europe than the USA) who are interested in how the climate actually works. Scientists who don't think billionaires, government and politicians should decide scientific matters; to tell us what to think. Brave scientists who know that climate change is almost 100% natural - driven in the main - by changes in the complex relationships between earth and the sun, and mediated by cloud cover changes over earth, ocean currents and oceans storing heat like a giant luke warm water bottle would."

We need to trust that our thought, which is our greatest quality, can change nature. We only need to understand the direction to which we should aim our thoughts. What should we think about? What condition or state should we aspire to and ask for?
In order to save our planet, we should think about positive human connections. That is, how can we, in our connections, keep nature safe? How can we all together protect our world? If we truly wish to better our planet, then we should see people holding a concern for how to positively connect everywhere that we look.
It has nothing to do with recycling or other activities that we commonly associate with as being sustainable. If we come closer to and consider each other, that we will reach an entirely organic, perfectly connected and round state, then the negative forces will disappear from the world.
We need to understand that if we start thinking better about each other, then the planet will recover from all harm, because our thoughts are the strongest force in nature. Likewise, our negative thoughts about each other are entirely to blame for damaging the planet. That is why the more we recycle and invest in energies and activities that we commonly think of as being sustainable, the worse our planet becomes. Nothing will work to benefit us until we reach a state where our attitude changes toward each other for the better to protect and improve our planet."

I am sure you all fear mongers were experts about the Green Deal as well as this clown story about Global Warming (which was recordable and proved false so they changed the term to ""Climate Change."") AOC's people admitted it wasn't about environment, but more about economy. 

NOTHING in this video which talked about ozone depletion from 70's to 80's, rising sea levels by the 90's, and the fear that the ice caps would melt by the 2000's came true. While reading the comments one would most definitely believe all of the lies the left has been pushing to be 100 % factual. The reality is that none of it has been proven true. For 70 years the liberals have sold FEAR  about many things. Yet results of Trump's presidency vs Biden's means nothing to the gullible who believe anything the left media pushes them.

 When one calls murdering any human life a woman's right and when the Superior Court decided that the decision in '72 ( from a liberal controlled congress ) was deceitfully portrayed as UNCONSTITUTIONAL and it was reversed, now the sudden fear of women's rights is all the newest left wing talking point. The left are trained to fear and hate. They made abortion so routine since the 1970's that now it is looked at as a simple health procedure nothing about the truth that it is a ROBBERY of what is considered the #1 right to ALL human's which is LIFE.

How can anyone believe that it is okay to murder a baby up to 5 minutes before delivered? Yet, the Democrats are always using the ""think of the children"" when selling their lies. They care nothing about anyone who is not a member of their dirty politics. ALL of the mandate BULLSHIT has been proven to be exactly that, BS! The vaccines actually helped to spread the virus than to slow or stop it. THE HILARIOUS MANDATE was with the masks in restaurants sitting down you were protected, even though the waitress touched one plate, one counter-top to another. Whilst the bartender who has been doing the same with each person at the bar hands her a germ print for her to pass on to your drink when delivered to the ""magic zone""  of sit down-ville.

Your gullible video from years ago has not aged well, as all lies that the left try to sell do not. Maybe you forgot the 3 PLUS years of constant lying about Russian collusion which has been proven to be a lie. A was a lie orchestrated by Hillary Clinton and the upper Democrat tiers of leadership with a FAKE DOSSIER which was paid for by HRC and the Democrats.

Oceans rising a few mm a year are not exactly ringing the alarm bells either.  Hopefully if it does become a problem we can do something to slow it, but our efforts may end up hurting the Earth more than helping.

"Nostrudoomus","2022-08-29T22:38:49Z","The heat CO2 absorbs it quickly releases when it goes into a water droplet in the atmosphere. Anything in a fluid MUST release its heat energy to the fluid, basic chemistry, then that water droplet evaporates, EVAPORATIVE COOLING occurs which wastes energy cooling the atmosphere this is why the Earth is called the water planet! Water evaporating in the atmosphere will happen over and over again until the atmosphere is below the vaporization temperature of water, which depends on atmospheric pressure. So the net effect of greater CO2 in the atmosphere might be slightly more cooling or a slight raise in humidity but the same balancing factors as always are still there so the net changes will be imperceptible.
If you are in a city and it has had record heat, that is because there is white cement, black pavement, and reflective glass everywhere this is not climate it is heat island effect, which comes from poor decisions by architects. It also comes from reactionary weather men in the media who report those temperatures which they know are bad and in the past would not have reported because those thermometers were in locations that were known to be artificially hot. 
If you live on an island that has eroding coastlines that is most likely because of SAND MINING! Sand mining is people or large companies digging up the sand on the beach or in the ocean and selling it for use as a foundation in construction. Do enough sand mining in the deep oceans below an island still quite far away from that island and it’s coastline will erode badly. Then the islanders try to sue for Climate Change and they have to sue the whole world, they probably won’t win, but if they sue the large corporations that do sand mining and the nations that build artificial islands and they probably will win!"

Second problem is that there isnt even enough water to flood all these citys etc. pp. Antarctica is actually getting bigger. Arctica floats on water, if it melts it dosnt rise the sealevel at all. 9/10 deadliest heatwaves in record of human history occurred since 2000? 8 billion people that live now vs 3 billion people and less that lived then, these numbers made this statistic... so are you surprised by that? Since 1970 60% of all wildlife has been killed... correlation is not = causation... obviously this is not done by the so called ""human made climatchange""... this is populism"
"Valkyrie909","2022-08-28T03:31:48Z","First it was acid rain. Then after that was debunked the climate crazies needed a new narrative, so here comes Al Gore to the rescue with 'the hole in the ozone layer'. Remember that? And when all their doom predictions didn't come true (because it was lies) they needed a new narrative. Hence 'Global Warming'. Oh my God! Only, once again, their lies were disproven. So what's a climate alarmist to do? Well, you change the narrative of course to something that CAN'T be disproven, like 'Global Climate Change'. Because the climate HAS ALWAYS CHANGED! Try to deny THAT one! But the big problem they have is history keeps proving them to be wrong. The left leaning press will not call out their lies and goes on reporting their new ones. Why? Two reasons. One, everyone learns when you are a kid that in order to cover one lie you must keep telling bigger lies, which is exactly what they are doing. Two, politics. This is the lefts chance to gain unprecedented control over the populace which is what all arrogant people desire. They are right about everything and you need to shut up (bye free speech) and obey (bye right to self-determination). Remember 'Manhattan will under water in 10 years'? Yeah, they said that 20 years ago. Proof that they don't believe their own predictions; Obama now lives on Martha's Vineyard- on the waterfront a few feet above sea level. Why would he buy a house that he has predicted will be under water in a few years? Because he knows it's a lie."

"helium73","2022-08-25T20:34:19Z","If you want to get rid of cars then get rid of zones.    People live in residential zones but they have to go to the commercial and industrial zones to work.    Then they have to drive to the commercial zones to get groceries.   Get rid of the zoning regulations and you get rid of the need for vehicles.      Climate change should be about getting rid of regulations rather than creating more.   Regulations help big business by killing their competition.    Ironically big businesses often fight regulation and end up helping small business.   Not always though.  Sometimes like when Amazon raised it's own minimum wage it then pushed for the law to change minimum wage for everyone thus hurting it's competition.    Competition keeps prices low but it also leads to innovations that may actually stop climate change.     What's odd is that you talk about climate change denial.    With the term: ""Climate Change"" denial is built in.   It's such a vague term it just begs to be denied.    ""Yeah right climate changes"".   :It's always changes and no matter what we do to improve the environment it will keep changing"".     Denial is built in.   At least you can measure global warming.    You can measure the loss of the rain forests.   It's as if the activists want deniers.   It's like they want a fight.

This is not the cause of which gives us our daily dose of mother nature. CO2 does not cause droughts-i mean really how does it tell humidity whether to coalesce. CO2 is not sensitive to all IR rays & reaches a saturation effect meaning at a point you get the law of diminishing returns-the photons begin to bump into the co2 molecules & this cuts the depth to which they can reradiate off the ground."

Data from the 70's to now also is no pattern. The facts have been very much manipulated and so have the extinction claims even here in Australia animals are the first to make a move in disasters and our Koalas do not sit and wait its being sensationalised and if there is no disaster they get no funding. Ads for the exaggerations like with these man made fires trees are rarely killed and the fauna regenerates and comes back strong. Look at your bushfires there is nothing left of houses burned to the ground yet the trees are green and been missed. Geo engineering is playing with our weather until they stop this and every one owns up to the level of and the actions they are undertaking this climate change is a joke as every bloody plant is at it so how do you call a climate crisis when ity mostly is man made same idiots who kept us on oil and now threaten our life styles as we need to fix it as they dictate and tell us to eat bugs when they live it up away out of site!

I remember being terrified looking at a map to see if I was going to drown and if they were right I would have  (in the mind of a 7year old) so not long after that my dad was looking at buying a 2nd car and I caused the biggest fuss cause I thought that I was definitely going to be burned alive by the sun or drown. I got in alot of trouble cause I kicked my dad cause of what the teachers were telling me... year 2000 goes by and by 2010 most households have 2+cars and definitely no real green energy to be seen, now starting to wonder when climate change was going to kick in.. 2020 comes around and we had the coldest summer I can remember and I can go to the same part of the beach that I did in the 90s.. no rising water, no 50°C summers... but life's sure getting expensive cause of this climate change and we get a few hot days and people cry climate change well do people think the earth is on rails staying the same distance from the sun for eternity?

2. Fossil fuels are the remnants of ancient flora and fauna and like all life are Carbon based and contain CO2. 3. CO2 is required for all plant life to photosynthesize the plants take in the Co2 remove the carbon atom and release oxygen. 4.ALL aerobic life forms take in oxygen and exhale CO2 humans lungs alone produce 3 billion tonnes of CO2 annually. Factor in the rest of animal life and uh oh life is pollution. 5.when CO2 is more readily available plants begin to grow larger and grow quicker. This will actually cause global cooling once plant life hits it stride, the carbon cycle provides carbon sinks as well as a means to offset excessive carbon. 6. Most living creatures feed on plants with the exploding food source animal population rises. It is the circle of life. A horse running full gallop produces more CO2 than a car. The lies are from those using this ""climate change""  (formerly known as global warming) as political spirit fingers. Just stop for a second and dismiss what your told to believe and find the time to read those crazy peoples article. I learned early if you go to a debate read the enemies playbook first.

"Cade Pellett","2023-02-14T01:38:10Z","@Leanne Karberg Actually, climate change is a complex issue and the climate relates to many multi-variable factors that creates different climate changes, including such things as cloud cover and how they're unable to accurately replicate cloud cover in the computer models they have, and how 90% of all C02 is stored in the oceans, and the role the sun plays upon our planet, not to mention the Milankovitch cycles.

Then you need to look at data from the Vostok Ice Cores dating back 450,000 years showing how when Temperature rises in the earth, C02 rises with it (with a lag of around 600-800 years). Then looking back to the Medieval times (known as the medieval warming period), where temperature was greater than it is today with the C02 concentration being 2000PPM to 3000PPM), all without fossil fuels (though they were likely burning wood). Lastly to understand that C02 in the atmosphere account for 0.04% of the atmosphere whereas water vapor accounts for 1-4% of the atmosphere and yet accounts for 97% of the total greenhouse warming of the planet. 

There is no one dial that influences our planet (as the mainstream media will have you believe). There are many different factors at play where all these things I've shared have hard data behind them. Even the IPCC earlier reports had the Medieval Warming Period graph in their reports, which they removed in subsequent reports."

But hey, keep believing the guys who sell you climate change lies when they live in their mansions that produce way more energy than an average home and fly around the in private jets and build their homes by the water that’s supposed to be rising👍🏼 They love brainwashed people like you. Good luck trying to get China to stop producing so much carbon 😂"
"OfficialTea Incorporated","2022-07-30T10:28:58Z","No one is saying we are going to die in 12 years except news companies begging for clicks. Climate change is real and mostly man-made, the Earth does go through cycles however the current trends show that the Earth is rapidly excelerating in temperature, much faster than our location in correlation to the sun and other points in the galaxy would cause.

Obama built a house on the seafront because he wanted a house on the seafront. He probably won't be alive for climate change to cause major sea level rise however his kids will which is why he wants to stop climate change."

"cvedeler","2022-06-20T00:06:02Z","I agree with everything in this video.  But the question remains, what do we do about it?  The US, China and India are the largest CO2 polluters.  The majority of Americans, never mind Chinese and Indians, are unwilling to forgo the convenience of fossil fuels.  Without a cheap and readily available alternative we humans won't be willing to change our ways until it is too late.  Electric cars won't save us.  Recycling won't save us.  Nuclear may be the best option, but can't be ramped up for many years and has it's own problems.  

We need a radical change in our priorities, comfort and lifestyle to even begin to make a dent in CO2 emissions.  I am quite pessimistic about the future given the realities we are confronted with.  Leaving the planet is not an option as there is no place better to go.  Mars makes the Earth look like paradise even with the worst global warming predicted and even if we could find a way to make it work, getting there in mass isn't possible. 

Humanity will be forced to do what we do best... adapt.  It won't be pretty and there will likely be a lot of massive social and political upheaval as we do.

"Trevor Westerdahl","2022-06-05T16:23:06Z","Which aspect is the lie? Any of you remember the biodomes that scientists built? Where are they now? Why don't you hear about them now? Why did funding plummet for those bio domes? The entire point with those domes was to create a controlled atmosphere. When you elevate C02 in that controlled environment... 

What happens?

1) Yes, the greenhouse effect occurs. That is not the important aspect... its what happens next...
2) The plants in that biodome adjust to the elevated levels and increase in size. The result: C02 levels start reducing. 

If you want to end world hunger. If you want more wood to build homes and furniture. If you more more trees to support the entire diversity of life from inspects, to birds, to cattle, to monkeys... you WANT more CO2, not less.

The actual problem is NOT CO2. The problem is reserving land for all those trees and plants. Then let them grow. CO2 will come down. Its how plants work (ya know photosynthesis).

Why aren't real solutions happening? Why does science feed us lies? Because science is driven by the funding from politicians Politicians use the science to scare society. Scared citizens now ""feel better"" paying ever greater in taxes, and paying higher prices for ""green alternatives"".

Its ALWAYS about money and power. Climate change is $TRillions folks. Trillions. The largest pile of political pork funding in the world. These same people who claim to be saving the earth and you... fly in corporate jets (worst carbon footprint ever), Live in lavish homes that have 100x the carbon footprint of regular folks. We can also add up on their vacationing, their large entourages they take with them, their cars, their boats....

Yeah, the live like millionaires... wait...they are millionaires... how is that? You guessed it... all those ""green dollars"" really just fund their lifestyles, their investments, and it extends to their families, their friends, etc.

Look at the stock market and, in particular, the ESG index. This index supposedly rates corporations for their sustainability and overall moral stewardship. That is the one thing is DOES NOT rank...not truthfully. Notice that Exxon is in the top-10 of that index. Not possible to be truthful just by looking at the ranking That is an index that is used to funnel your tax dollars. It's who gets all that green money (besides the politicians). It is created by the corrupt, to rank the corrupt... to specifically put themselves at the front of line for your tax dollars.

Most ""science"" is directly funded by this political pork pay line. What to get a larger piece of the pie, be most effective at influencing the general population to believe the lies that feed the political pork. 

One thing I know for sure... most people have know idea where all that money goes. Its impossible for anyone know exactly what you are getting. You can't. They promised nothing but generalities. You might name some aspects that are good, or at least appear good, but most of the money spent is dark money hidden from the majority of the population. 

None of us should support multi-billion dollar bills, let alone $Trillion+ bills with meaningless titles like ""Save the Earth Bill"". For example, over 90% of the money spent on the ""Covid Relief"" bill didn't go to Covid relief. All large funding is just a giant slush fund where sleazy politician divert the money for corrupt, self-serving purposes.

Again, which aspect is the lie or lies?"

"Graeme Ratcliffe","2022-06-04T09:17:43Z","There is no consensus among scientists to say the world is warming because of CO2. There is only a media consensus. The logarithmic diminution of the radiative forcing of CO2 will ensure there will be no increase in atmospheric temperature due to its increased presence in the atmosphere. This fact is well understood in the climate science community and can be accurately modelled using the Modtran program maintained and supported at the University of Chicago.The logarithmic diminution of the radiative forcing of CO2 is probably the reason why there was no runaway greenhouse warming from CO2 in earlier eons when CO2 levels were known to be at levels of several thousands ppmv (parts per million). Remarkably, IPCC published reports (TAR3) do actually acknowledge that the effective temperature increase caused by growing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere radically diminishes with those increasing concentrations. This information is in their report, Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate.From the present concentration of atmospheric CO2 at approaching 415 ppmv, only 5% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a Greenhouse Gas remains. This can only give rise to a maximum of a further of +0.21°C. Thereafter beyond 1000+ ppmv the effect of increasing levels of CO2 can only ever be absolutely minimal, even if CO2 concentrations were to increase indefinitely.That is the science."

"Secularanarchist","2022-05-30T13:34:17Z","It’s all manipulative bullshit and that is all we need to understand. The IPCC stands for ‘Intergovernmental’ not ‘interdisciplinary’ panel on climate change - that already should make people realise that climate change is primarily a political and economic, not an environmental, scientific issue. The fact is that real science is never about consensus or settled. Who is conducting the peer reviews on this ‘settled’ science? It is my understanding that the peer review process is directed and overseen in-house by the IPCC, because their science is apparently settled. How does that make the process truly independent and interdisciplinary? 

So we are told that we only have a 12 year window of opportunity to stop catastrophic global warming. Okay, great, but what happens if nothing happens in 12 years and these predictions turn out wrong! Will I get my money back and will the IPCC be held accountable? 

I have noticed that when we get extreme cold spells it is referred to as weather, but when it gets hot it is climate change. Clearly the language is not intended to be manipulative. 

A two degree temperature increase will not permanently melt the poles or upend existing eco-systems. Nature is extremely resilient, adaptable and has  responded to and corrected environmental imbalances for hundreds of millions of years. Thus making nature far more adept at evolution and adaptation than us. There was a time, before humans, when the world was 13 degrees warmer than it is today and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 2000 ppm. Currently CO2 concentration is around 380 ppm. Sure, the planet looked a little different then, but life was thriving and coral reefs existed in places that are now too cold. This is science fact, not speculation, which logically tells me that a two degree warming is very manageable in global and environmental terms. How humans will cope, however, is another issue. Judging by the mental meltdowns they are having over the speculation of what might be, doesn’t bode well for our species. 

I am if the opinion that the current take on climate change is akin to the believe in the end days. People wish it to be true because they convince themselves that everything is broken and the only way to fix it is to go through some cathartic change and where they imagine themselves as coming out empowered and on top. 

BTW, I am not a ‘denier’ of climate change. The climate has and continues to change and maybe humans do in some small way influence that change. I am all for studying and understanding this issue better. However, I do not subscribe to the militant ideologues and the opportunistic politics that are the elephant in the room of global warming."

"Bonobo Norman","2022-05-16T15:03:48Z","Where has common sense gone? Is common sense no longer common? 
Is there really something like a true global climate? For example, at the equator there is a rainforest climate, around the Mediterranean they enjoy a Mediterranean climate and up north they have a Nordic climate. Around the world we find many different climates, warmer or colder, dry or wet with windy days. A ""global climate"" from only a temperature perspective makes absolutely no common sense! Why worry about a simple global mathematical average from temperatures sampled from many places over time? Obviously, the global climate from this single measurement does not exist anywhere on the planet because it is just a static figure down to a 1/10 of one Celsius degree. It seems silly that the worlds temperature represents climate in the same way as people's “average age” with half of the world’s population above and the younger 50% below middle to represents the calculated ""human age"". What would such global “human age” tell us about any specific individual? Nothing of course! So what does the “world temperature” tell us? Nothing, because such a “global temperature” is NOT something that can be experienced at any specific location. 

If we choose an arbitrary place, like a village in southern Scandinavia, the temperature at that village varies every single day by about 10 degrees between 25 degrees on a summer afternoon and 15 degrees late at night. During all four seasons of a year, the temperature in the same village can vary a lot more, maybe as much as 50 Celsius degrees, from icy -20 during a clear winter night to +30 degrees on balmy summer days. If the temperature at that village changes on average one degree here or there, it does not really matter at all for the villager’s life. Yet, we are bombarded by shrill preachers claiming that species will become extinct, and diversity will decline due to a one degree change in global mathematical average temperature. We are told about imminent ""mass extinction events"" and that human living conditions are guaranteed to be destroyed for sure. Really? What does your common sense say?  Could +26 degrees during the day and +16 at night eradicate fauna, flora, and microorganisms? The south part of Scandinavian has very different fauna, flora, and microorganisms than the central landscapes, or the wild northern regions. Spring comes to the south a month earlier than what they expect up north, etc. Common sense tells us that what is likely to happen, namely that some of the southern life forms will seen further north and bloom a little earlier during spring. Well, such healthy natural variation is precisely what scientists have observed from recorded treelines over thousands of years during a variety of historical climate conditions.

Should we trust what we are told or dare to trust our God given common sense?  Many are too easily frightened by all sorts of dire predictions and intimidating threats. Frightened people desperate for a cure for their anxiety will readily accept anything on offer. In a panicked climate context, it can be anything from stopping the use of cars, forsake air travel and cancelling holiday trips. Even rationing meat, reducing home heating or cooling, and discourage young children from dreaming of an interesting, bright, and active future lifestyle. 

It is noteworthy what the Nobel Laureate Manne Siegbahn once reminisced. When he began to study physics at the beginning of the last century, many academics like himself honestly believed that only a few more pieces of Mother Natures puzzle remained to be discovered and then science would have a complete holistic knowledge of the physical reality around us. However, it did not take long for extraordinary thinkers like Einstein, Planck and Bohr to name but a few, to open up large knowledge gaps in the picture and even to change the boundaries of already laid puzzle pieces. Today we are told with 100% certainty that the ""science is settled"" despite that history teaches us that the only thing we know for sure, is that we never know everything, especially about something as complicated and chaotic as Mother Natures climate system. This is not to say that we should ignore our precautionary principles, but we must also trust our common sense in the face of the many reckless political decisions that are rushed through only because the “Masters of Power” are 100% certain that we need to be saved from a imaginary world-wide ""climate crisis"". 

In their too common ignorance, our leading politicians seem to hope for a day when we will all be able to see with the naked eye that a climate crisis is raging outside the window, like an approaching comet. This is a futile hope because a changing climate is as invisible to the human eye as the molecules and atoms in our own body. Despite this, the old mass-media is desperate to link every hot day, every recent forest fire, a glacier caught melting, another drought, earthquakes, changing land and sea levels and flooding rains as if they were occurring for the first time in Earth's history and must therefore must be valid evidence proving ""climate change"". Globally we are just over one degree warmer today than during the ""Little Ice Age"" when the Thames froze over and millions of Europeans starved with numerous deaths. Scientists, journalists, or anyone should be sharing that during the ""Little Ice Age"" it was much colder globally, and since then the climate thankfully has improved until this day! 

But instead of being delighted about this climate normalisation they tell us that any increase in temperature is about ""greenhouse heating"" and it is our generations fault due to our irresponsibly luxurious way of life! Never are any other possible causes discussed than our modern way of living where energy from fossil fuel is the most important factor that has pulled us out of poverty. We are told that unless we funnel our economic powers into stopping the temperature from rising by another degree before the end of the century, we will waste ""Planet One', and we will wipe out our civilization as we know it. We are told that the climate must and can be tamed and controlled by our generation of people by following the directives that politicians give us. The directives are made to influence every part of our daily lives. Previous climate history is ignored like the recent climate emergency that struck Europe in the 1860s. During that “Little Ice Age” summers went missing or were too short for farmers to grow and harvest crop. Few people have the stomach to reflect over the fact that such ""Little Ice Age"" could return at any time during coming decades. What social and logistic preparedness will be needed for our densely overpopulated world are questions that has become irrelevant because of the ""Climate Crisis"" in our overheating Bland New World.

Propaganda has historically been used for evil purposes - often influencing children and the young alike. It is favoured by dictators who are stuck in their own dogma regarding the politically acceptable. As a rule, the ""Masters of Power"" speak with well-chosen words, often in combination with adjectives such as emergency, crisis, and threats, so obedient people can be herded along a predetermined compass direction. Common sense means to look critically at the flow of messages and using our own intuitive examination of what can be regarded as moral, sensible, wise, and above all realistic. This is clearly not just a battle over “climate truth” and this fight will most likely never end. Today and during past millenniums, people has never known what the future may hold. With a reasonable outlook, humanity will be able to go where the future trends are heading and like every generation before us, we can trust our future descendants to live in ways that they find wise and justified, just like it always has been."

Are you one of those people who are alarmed by the claim that CO2 levels are at there highest in 800,000 years? If so, don't worry, the claim is simply a marketing ploy to scare the kiddies. It is meaningless. In terms of geological time 800,000 years is nothing. If the earth were a year old, 800 thousand years would amount to a mere 92 minutes. Would you judge a city's annual climate by a sample period of just 92 minutes? The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reduced by about 90% over the past 150 million years. Even though its level has increased fractionally during the Holocene epoch, CO2 is still at an average of only 415 parts per million. Far from being a matter for alarm, this recent increase is most fortunate. After all, in order to survive, plants require an absolute minimum or 150 ppm atmospheric CO2. Many plants species suffer stress at amounts well above that. Immediately prior to the Holocene the level of CO2 went down to 180 ppm. We would not like to see that occur again. Since the Cambrian explosion atmospheric CO2 has averaged 2,000 ppm and through most of the Mesozoic era was at 3,000 ppm. It has been 300 million years since CO2 levels have been as low as they are today. It must be noted that at no time in the past did high levels of CO2 result in runaway climate change. The CO2/water vapour positive feedback loop has never occurred and will never occur. CO2 enrichment in greenhouses allows crops to meet their photosynthesis potential. The supply of extra CO2 is an often-applied method to increase the yield of greenhouse crops. The current hysteria over rising levels of atmospheric CO2 has no basis in science."

"Sean Workman","2022-05-11T12:23:58Z","There is no evidence that CO2 is the major contributor to warming and if you think that sea level rise of 0.2 mm per year is a problem then you may also think that a major flood in Australia that causes sea level to drop is a problem. If you go back to the 1930's CO2 was lower but temperature were higher and if you want truth go to news papers of the time, has anyone heard of the American dustbowl?  What of this thing in the sky called the SUN? Does it contribute to the climate of the planet?
I think that the planet has climate cycles that are beyond the understanding or control of humans. That does not make me a climate denier, it means I am a climate realist. Have any of you noticed that none of the grave predictions of doom have come to pass, New York was supposed to be under water 30 years ago but is not.

It does not mean that Exxon, specifically, are evil. It does mean that exon works as a capitalistic business. It is in the roots of capitalism to evolve around ""how to make the biggest possible financial benefits"". And that's why, as long we remain dependent of this kind of economic system, we won't be able to take decisions hard enough to confront the challenges we're facing. We're losing time, year after year. And that's the poorest, the weakest, individuals, those living in endangered areas, around the coasts, and so on, that will pay the price. Keep in mind that if rich businessmen are so much looking for technological solutions, it is because they are not Willing to evolve toward a sustainable, fairer and more stable political and economical system. So they basically are searching solutions... for them. That most of us will not be able to afford. 

We need to find a way to create the conditions for the emergence of an economic and political system allowing sustainable development, democratic control over the businesses and institutions, international decisionsmaking, and meeting universal basic needs.

Did you know that several countries(including the western half of the US and Australia) have banned the use of fire-preventing natural methods such as thinning the tree-line and clearing the underbrush of leaves and dead materials?  

Did you know that on the topic of money, many large politicians have invested into ""green energy"" firms that afterwards went bankrupt for being unsustainable while the politicians pocketed millions in investments?  

Did you know that the only proof of the greenhouse effect is an experiment trapping gas within a glass box(essentially a magnifying glass) and recording a temperature increase?

Did you also know that most green projects will not offset their carbon footprint, EVER, due to the materials required to build it all and the energy required for mining and production? 

Did you know that some efforts to reduce global warming have actually CAUSED it but have not been reprimanded for the image the ""cause"" represents?  example:  white roofs reflecting sunlight and heating the atmosphere ;China increasing coal consumption as other countries decrease their demand as the price falls for unused material

Did you know that preventing environmental disaster is the oldest trick in a con-artists playbook where entire religions were founded based upon the idea of getting good weather?

Its a much simpler solution then you may think but it takes 1 thing that naturally humans are against which is a little bit of effort from everyone. To put it simply, if every child in grade 8/9 did 1 class of skateboarding lessons during their school year instead of gym class then 90% of kids who graduate grade 12 would be capable of skateboarding. This means that they can ride electric skateboards to their jobs everyday instead of a car. Not only would they be happier in life because they are enjoying their commute everyday but they would also be much healthier by getting exercise. They would save $170,000 over the course of 20 years by avoiding the high costs of driving a car (which is enough to buy a house btw). Global warming would be solved by eliminating 90% of car emissions. Nobody will get there skateboard stolen because you can carry it with you in stores. Traffic will be a distant memory of the past. Parking space that take up one 3rd of city space will be free'd up for new stores or businesses. Car accidents and deaths will be a distant memory of the past (skateboard injures may occur but close to 0 deaths per year because they only weigh 20 pounds unlike cars that weigh 4000 pounds.) I could go on with all the benefits but essentially it would create world peace and solve depression, global warming, obesity and it would cost the tax payers $0 and can be achievable in under 2 years from now."

This is nothing more than a political economical game of western civilization nothing more nothing else. I have met so many scientists over the years saying the same thing we can not alter the climate on a global scale no matter how much we try never. Carbon dioxide is at the same level as it was 100 years ago. Everything you have heard is scientists getting paid by America to make you believe that climate change is real. There is such a whole big dispute is scientists and most of them know the truth. Yet they are afraid to speak because no one will listen and they are playing their head if the tell people what is actually happening. Please CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT DUE TO HUMAN FACTORS, IT HAS ALWAYS HAPPENING AND ALWAYS WILL UNTIL THE DEATH OF EARTH. i have no power i am just a random comment of youtube but if i can make at least one man to rethink everything this is a win for me! Please use your head do not believe their lies!"

""Our results confirm, as has been found in numerous other previous studies of this question, that there is no significant scientific debate among experts about whether or not climate change is human-caused. This issue has been comprehensively settled, and the reality of ACC is no more in contention among scientists than is plate tectonics or evolution. The tiny number of papers that have been published during our time period which disagree with this overwhelming scientific consensus have had no discernible impact, presumably because they do not provide any convincing evidence to refute the hypothesis that—in the words of IPCC AR5—'it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century' [12], and, most recently in IPCC AR6—'it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land' [13].""

There is No ‘climate emergency’.
How many times must we hear that ‘the world has only eight years left’ and nothing ever happens…???

Also, why do we never hear BOTH sides of the debate??? Isn’t that what science (which, by the way, is NOT a democracy!) is all about???

• In 1922 the Washington Post carried an article saying that within 10 years, there will be no more ice caps, seals are dying off and great shoals of fish were depleting at an exponential rate. It went on to state also that within 10 years the Earth’s coastal cities will be fully submerged.

• In the 1970s, there was the great acid rain scare.

• in the 1970s/‘80s, as a youngster I remember news reports (you can still find them on YouTube) stating that with global cooling, we’re now about to move into a new ice age. They even proposed covering the polar ice caps with black soot in order to *stimulate* melting so as to prevent global cooling.

• in the 1990s/2000s, the issue of global warming was put forward and the scare-mongering recommenced with, additionally, the idea of a hole in the ozone layer was set to destroy us all!

• According to Al Gore, the world’s coastal cities should be submerged by now (actually projected for 5 years ago), and the polar caps completely gone. [Very interesting how real-estate agents are still selling multi-million dollar coastal residences in Florida and elsewhere. Obama, for example, hasn’t sold his coastal estate and scurried off in blind panic].

• With global warming having become static for 25 years, they decided to *conveniently* change the description from ‘global warming’ to ‘climate change’.

• Recently, they’ve again been postulating the idea that the Earth is now cooling.

...and through all this, we’re STILL being taxed and penalised on the basis of so-called ‘man-made climate change’.

The man-made climate change issue is nothing but a cockeyed myth.

As Thatcher said after changing her mind about the whole issue: “Global warming ‘provides a marvellous excuse for worldwide, supra-national socialism’”.

But the climate change was not discovered by Exxon and not in 1980.
As far as I know, Exxon started the research on climate change in the second half of the 1970s because they were afraid that they could be held responsible for climate change and wanted to check facts and to find reasons why they can't be responsible for global warming. But unfortunately for them, the research didn't come to the facts they had hoped for.

For me, the history of climate change started at the end of the French revolution, when Prof. „Baron de l'Empire“ Jean Baptiste Josef Fourier and chairman of a revolutionary committee, who was a mathematician and scientist who made many important discoveries and developed some mathematical processes, decided in 1824 to 1827 to calculate the energy balance of planet Earth. Since the climate gases and their impacts were not known at that time, he was astonished that his calculations resulted in an AVERAGE temperature on the planet that should be minus 15 deg. Centigrade or 5 deg. Fahrenheit, since he didn't know he had to consider the impacts of CO2 and Methane. (A few hundred years ago the instruments were not so precise, so the correct average should have been minus 18º C or -0.4º F). He published his results in „Mémoire sur les températures du globe terrestre et des espaces planétaires“ p.97-125
https://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Fourier/Fourier_pdf/Mem1827_p569_604.pdf

The climate gases were first discovered by American women's rights campaigner and scientist, who published her discoveries about the warming effect of climate gases in November 1856:
„Affecting the heat in the sun's rays” (American Journal of Science and Arts)
https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002152491/page/381/mode/2up?view=theater

From 1859 to 1862 Irish Professor John Tyndall did further research on climate gases.
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1861.0001

Between 1896 and 1906 Swedish Professor and Nobel-Prize winner, Dr. Svante Arrhenius showed that the climate of the Earth is dependent on CO2 concentration.

In 1912 New Zeeland Newspaper „Rodney & Otamatea Times“ published a short article that due to the burning of coal the temperature of Earth would rise.

In 1938 Guy Steward Callendar warned that global warming due to the Greenhouse Effect is already progressing.

During the 1940s (WWII) German meteorologist Hermann Flohn from the High Command of the German „Luftwaffe“ (Air Force) warned about the slow but contionueous rise of temperature. The article „Die Tätigkeit des Menschen als Klimafaktor“ was published in the magazin „Erdkunde“ (Geography) No. 9, 1941, Page 13 to 22.  (no online-copy available)  

The US Airforce did research on global warming in the 1940s, too.

1956 The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs warns that the atmospheric CO2 concentration will rise 25% until the end of the century.

1957 scientists Roger Revelle and Hans Suess were surprised about the high concentration of fossil CO2 (proved by the Radiocarbon method).

1958 The US TV informs it viewers about global warning (see Leonardo de Caprio's movie about global warming)

1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson warns in a speech at the Congress about Global Warming and rising CO2-Levels, after having received a warning report from the governmental „Science Advisory Committee“ which was established in 1951 by Harry Trueman at the Dept. of Defense.

The cartoon graphic showing the sun sending rays through the ""CO2"" layer to the earth where they're re-emitted and absorbed by the CO2 is ignoring a very key fact: the impinging rays from the sun are also first absorbed by CO2 and re-emitted into space before ever reaching earth. A barrier works both ways. This doesn't even consider formation of more reflecting cloud cover with warming. The hottest climate recorded in US history was 1930s dust bowl, and temps have gone down compared to that time. It is very complicated and now polticized, producing the likes of this video. The real truth needs to be uncovered, if at all possible now."

Volcano and forest fire data could be used as a model. Dust is naturally occurring and lime dust has antiacid properties. Think about it, who wouldnt want their local weather to be less hot.  The dust is temporary but lasts several years. The dust cloud can be managed either more or less by how many flights are done. Target areas over 100° and reduce temperatures to say less then 90°. Do local and regional territories. If there  are problems, just stop and let the dust settle out, this should be a stop gap program to give cultural and technical change on earth to take hold, things like electric cars and solar and wind power have more time to develop. Accumulation of dust in the atmosphere over time would cool the entire planet. We need to start small and learn how to do this, Junk airliners can be converted to dusters for cheaper investment."

When Governments around the world have Very costly weather modifying technology like America's HAARP, well one can only assume they will use it. If the technology exists and we know they are using it, we can't claim the world is changing and listen to the lies of climate change and we can only point a finger at the instillations and assume they are causing the extreme weather. Look up HAARP and you will see that they openly share and are proud of manipulating the weather and ask yourself, should I believe and trust those Governments and controlled scientists who claim we are facing climate change, when they have weather modifying weather technology? Should I really be parroting those who aim to change the weather and who aim impose weird carbon taxation?

We on Earth are in an ice age cycle that started about 2.5 million years ago (see Milankovic cycle), it started out with about 41, 000 of ice and a 2 or 3,000 year of interglacial warming period, then 800,000 years ago the cycle changed to about a 95,000 ice to about 10,000 years of warming (interglacial period).  We came out of the ice age period about 13,000 years ago or so, we are over due for the ice age cooling period. Why are we overdue? Because humans began warming the planet with the advent of large scale farming, forest clearing, flooding rice fields, animal husbandry on a large scale etc. (civilization activities)10,000 years ago. Earth actually began cooling again as per Milankovic cycle years ago but Humans staved off the returning ice age that long ago but we are over doing it now.

I mean the complete loss of individual rights and abilities such that no society has or will ever see. The Catholic Church and the U.N. are the directors of this scam which will catapult the world into the masonic and the elitist New World Order and the C word virus was I feel the fuse that was lit to scare people into starting to bend over so the preverbal NWO could spit on their penile head and start walking towards our bottom ends dripping with fear and worry unless they stick us with those swollen harpoons of freedom stealing and genocidal concoction that will rid the world of 1/3 of its population. Its all based on lies and they think that we are so unintelligent that we will fall for the trap. Well This guy aint falling , giving up or hiding for that matter. They have underrated the intelligence of free people in society and grossly neglected their own due diligence in the study of our psych. We out number them a million to 1 and their royal interbreeding has obviously cost them I.Q. levels points. The likes of these people whom are mostly the top 1% don’t care to shed a dime to feed the hundreds of thousands of neglected children around the world whom on a daily bases are dying for lack of nutrition. So if you think they care about the earth you could not be more mistaken and that should be quite obvious. We aint buying your lies globalists.I am speaking to NASA,The Vatican jesuits, U.N., Bill Gates, Clintons, Barack insane Obama and all you other globalist child sacrificing cabalists whom are involved. These are not God fearing people whom have your best interests in mind and would love nothing more than to strip you of your basic human rights and are more than willing to take your life which holds no intrinsic value in their minds. We do not need your demon harpoons to protect us from your created virus. We serve the real God that never sleeps and is fully aware of your atrocities. I pray God will lend you mercy and the righteous punishment that will soon set upon your heads like a fleeting sun on a warm summers day. On that note I love my free brothers and will meet you in due time and God speed men. Oh and I am the nephew of the late and Great Robert E. Lee. His blood runs through these veins and I feel an awakening in my soul to reel in those whom hold no fear and whom cherish this free land and the likes thereof. For we will not buckle or bend to such tyrants whom tread our waters with their snake oil bottles of lies. Not on this land from which God has so graciously given that is painted with my ancestors blood. If my blood were to fall upon the roots of this precious ground in its defense. I can hardly imagine a better way to die.  M. Lee"

As a result Obama bought property in Martha's Vineyard which is very close to the beach and valued at 11.75 million in 2021. Gore spent 8.9 million 2010 dollars on beach front property and is not preparing to sell it. If climate change is as devastating as the predictive models are saying, then why invest in property which is essentially worthless in 20 years or so. Considering that 20 to 30 years is a typical mortgage, they basically made a bad investment. What does that tell you about climate change?"

An analogy I often use is when someone sees a friend after not seeing them for a few years - They see the drastic aging that has taken place. However, if they saw their friend everyday, they would have never noticed such a drastic change. Climate change is denied by those who cannot stand to be wrong about something they think they are knowledgeable about when in reality they know nothing. Climate change being made political was possibly a death sentence for us. It caused us to waste years of time that could have been spent on finding solutions to this problem. COVID 19 echoes this problem. It was made political and now humanity will suffer because those that will not get vaccinated, are the same types of people who denied climate change for so long."

Bullshit. Mankind emits approximately 60 times more greenhouse gases than the planet's volcanoes

 ""We are moving into a global ice age, and humans cannot  ignore the obvious cause, our nearest star, the Sun.""
Bullshit. Although solar irradiance (the amount of heat energy reaching Earth) has been in decline for four decades, and we _should_ be cooling, the 36 billion tons of greenhouse gases that man emits every year into our atmosphere more than counterbalances the cooling effect. _Only_ mankind's greenhouse gas emissions can explain the current rapid warming the planet is experiencing. 
 
""Climate change is a cycle that is not  caused by humans, plain and simple.""
Bullshit. Climate change is caused by three fundamental forcings: changes in solar energy, changes in atmospheric gas concentrations, and changes is aerosols and particulates.

This is just your opinion mate, not a fact. As long as you learn to distinguish between opinion and fact, you'll make less of a fool of yourself. Climate researchers have shown the link between CO2 and temperature repeatedly over 120 years of research. Not even the most ideologically-driven deniers cling to the claim that CO2 doesn't cause warming. If it didn't cause warming, Earth would be approx 33c cooler than it is. 

""Not only that co2 is a god particle to life and is need for survival of all organic matter with out the planet would be barron""
CO2 is certainly essential for life, but that doesn't preclude it from heating the planet. Nobody with any serious intentions in science uses the term ""God particle"" - such a term is left to the religiously-inclined

""so you're net zero co2 is bs fella and sounds like communism doctrine. I hope you and greta thunberg do well.""

It is not supported by the wealth of evidence that has lead practically every single, currently-publishing, climate scientist to conclude that man's emissions of greenhouse gases, in particular CO2, is causing the Earth's climate to rapidly warm. You make yourself look stupid repeating this nonsense.

Solar flares do not have a cyclical impact, and ""Sun cycles"" (I guess you're talking about the Milankovitch Cycles) impact Earth on a much longer time scale than the warming we are currently witnessing. But hey! I'm open-minded - if you can you support your spurious claim with a reference to credible research, I'll give it a read.

""The fact majority of farmers like myself have had bountiful harvest due to the heavy rains this season speaks volumes, rather than your  greata Pseudo science.""
Farming is a very regional activity. If you have been lucky enough to have a bountiful harvest, spare a thought for the tens of thousands of Indian farmers who commit suicide every year because the warming climate is making crop growing more and more challenging.

A number of years ago, I asked the same question. Instead of dismissing the work of an entire field of scientists because they knew something I didn't, I decided to Google the question and do some reading....and now I know the answer: Isotopic analysis of atmospheric carbon dioxide and understanding the change in Carbon-12 to Carbon-13 in the atmosphere. I would post you a URL so you can read for yourself, but if you go to Skeptical Science and search for _Human fingerprints on climate change rule out natural cycles_ , this is one of just many very informative articles on how we know man is causing current warming. 

""And why did they change it from Global Warming to Climate Change...is it because the climate started cooling and that didn't fit the narrative so they had to  change it to climate change that if its going down or up then its because of Climate change""
No. Not even close. The short answer is that nobody changed Global Warming to Climate Change. Both terms have been used in the scientific literature for at least the past 50 years. Furthermore, they refer to different phenomena. GW is simply the warming of the mean global surface temperature, whereas CC covers all the myriad impacts that GW has on the climate, such as changing rainfall patterns, harsher winters at some latitudes, more frequent storms in the tropics etc. They are not interchangeable terms, so GW can never simply change to CC. This is simply a myth being spread by mendacious politicians and commentators.

""Check with CNN any your local public school and let me know the answer""
I'm happy to share with you the scientific research which underpins what we know about the climate Brent. Because of the sheer volume of garbage being pumped out by the media on climate research, especially the Murdoch-owned media, I used to have my own doubts about whether the scientists knew what they were doing. Since I didn't have the credentials or the authority to question their work, I simply started to read. And then it all made sense. The media is full of crap and the scientists really do know what they are talking about. Good day to you, sir, and I'm sorry for being rude earlier."

I know....it's very disheartening to realize that all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your kids ""The Green Revolution"" science project, throwing out all of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and speedboat, vacationing at home instead of abroad, nearly getting hit every day on your bicycle, well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days.  The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth's atmosphere in just four days - yes,  FOUR DAYS  - by that volcano in Iceland which has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should mention that when the volcano Mt. Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991,  it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth. Yes, folks, Mt. Pinatubo was active for over one year - think about it. Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect climate change. And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years And it happens every year. Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus 'human-caused' climate-change scenario. Hey, isn't it interesting how they don't mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just  “Climate Change”  - you know why? It's because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees  in the past century and these global warming bull**** artists got caught with their pants down   And, just keep in mind that you might yet be stuck with an Emissions Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer.

YUP...THATS RIGHT! 
It got the carbon from breaking the Carbon Dioxide molecules in the air down into CARBON and OXYGEN.
It split the molecule by photo synthesis...released all the oxygen back into the air...and then used the carbon to build itself.
The tree is almost 100% Carbon.  That’s why it can burn and turn back into Carbon Dioxide once the oxygen is once more combined with it when it burns.

Behold, the whole earth is corrupt and filled with violence! Lo, even My own people fight against Me! Indeed, all flesh have corrupted their way before Me[1]...

Therefore I shall bring calamity in waves, great destruction upon this generation of evil men, evil men who are set under the authority of evil men, hidden evil in high places! For I am come to stir up the multitudes, and to shake the nations mightily! Behold, I shall grab hold of the Pacific plate, and twist! I shall press down hard, and it shall tip, it shall crack, it shall surely buckle!
In that day, the waters shall flow backward! No more shall I cause the ocean to know its place! No more shall I say to the waters, “You shall proceed no further!” For I shall strike the northernmost parts, until they are no more! I shall reach down to the south, into the great treasuries of ice and snow, and push them into the sea in one day! And the seas shall increase by measure before the eyes of all these multitudes, before the eyes of all those who dwell near the coastline, and before the paled faces of the wealthy, who by greed and evil gain have constructed tall towers and built extravagant houses upon the shore!
Therefore, watch! Be awestruck in astonishment, O foolish people who build on the sand![2] Watch how swiftly calamity overtakes you, how the waters inundate and swallow up the shores, how the land shrinks back at the power of the sea! Says The Lord.
Behold, I will show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth beneath, blood and fire and pillars of smoke! The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, as it is written![3] Satan’s strongholds shall be swallowed up, and all these vines of wickedness shall be uprooted and cast into the depths of the sea! City by city shall be oppressed and broken down, when I call nature to rise up and fight against you!
Then you will know, I AM THE LORD! For the word of the wisest among you shall fail, and the knowledge of the most learned shall be accounted as dung, when calamity upon calamity breaks out in every corner! Says The Lord.
Behold, My every burning tear, which you have caused, shall rain down in torrents of flooding rain, with a great multitude of hail mixed with fire and blood![4] It shall inundate the cities and towns, while still other places shall be left utterly desolate!
Behold, the dry and cracked ground shall speak in the hollows of the waste places as a testament against you, O most wicked generation! For My anger is kindled, the heat of My fury has come up into My face, and shall scorch the earth in the day I repay you for all your wickedness![5] Says The Lord.

Therefore hear My words,
And heed the sound of this Trumpet!
For I am God alone; there is none besides Me![6]...

For I tell you the truth, it has come, all have entered in!

Behold, the outcry of the prophets has
Come forth, the Word of The Lord is here!...

Behold, the bundles are tied and set in their places, and still the people mock! And those called Christian say, “Are we not the chosen? Yes, we are the elect of God”... Woe, I say to you! Woe to you and all your arrogant houses; you have surely deceived yourselves!

Bow down therefore and humble yourselves,
Heed the call and depart from

As I strike the earth in My anger, My tears run down! As famine spreads forth across the land, My heart is rent inside Me over the hardness of men’s hearts! As My face fills with the heat of My fury, My eyes are set ablaze with fire over that which I see! My tears run down, My blood pours down. As My own servants turn from Me and run, as My own beloved, whom I have called sons and daughters, turn and fight against Me, as My own body betrays Me, My blood pours down, My tears run down.

China causes more pollution in one day than America does in an entire year! Punishing Taxpayers and implementing Socialism isn’t going to fix that! A Civil War between Americans & Communists will cause more pollution. ANTIFA BLM Terrorists burned down entire city blocks & started some wildfires in the Pacific Northwest, which caused a huge amount of air pollution, burned down trees, killed people & animals, destroyed personal property, burned down small businesses including minority owned businesses & are Hate Crimes Against Americans. 
The Left is using Climate Change as an excuse to bring in Socialism and Communism. They are using it as a way to control people, for example, CCPVirus Lockdowns. They told us Two Weeks & It Will Flatten the Curve! They LIED! They will continue to Lie in order to pass Tyrannical Legislation& take away more Freedoms & more Rights, which they already have done. Democrat Lockdowns caused the permanent closure of 1/3 of all bars & restaurants in NYC. They have arrested people for refusing to close their restaurants over Mandates that are Unconstitutional and are Not Laws! They have committed Police Brutality for refusing to wear Masks outdoors. Now they are forcing people to take The Shots or be Fired. Americans are refusing to Comply with Medical Tyranny. Democrats are the New Nazis, forcing Medical Experiments on people & Segregation against the UnVaxxed. That’s how the Holocaust started. First Jews were banned from the workplace, their businesses were closed down, they were bullied by their neighbors, then they were Segregated, remember the Warsaw Ghetto, then they were rounded up and taken away to the Concentration Camps! Everyone knows what happened next. These Mandates are diabolical & UnAmerican! Using The Climate to control people and make tyrannical laws stealing taxpayers money & private property is not going to work out for Democrats! 
Go protest in China if you people are really serious. We Will Not Comply with Socialist Tyranny, Medical Tyranny, which Violates the Constitution, Civil Rights & Civil Liberties & the Nuremberg Code! We Will Not Comply with Climate Tyranny Lockdowns ever again! Democrats have destroyed millions of jobs & our economy!

If there were any proven  science you would have a better understanding of this. We also know as a race that the majority of Earth-based science that we have have so far learnt is often proved flawed. You then bleat on about how you have been lied to and these companies need to be sued. This is the dimness of youth it will never happen and it is not an option. Suggesting it makes you into a half witted extremist. This allows those who want to ignore the climate agenda to label you as such. Stop with the harbinger of doom predictions. The older generation were told we would all be fried by now due to the hole in the ozone layer/ hasn’t happened. Which in no way means we shouldnt take actions to preserve the planet. But you’re doing exactly the same thing, which makes it easy for people to ignore your agenda, as an extremist. As for you’ve got to sort it out as the young inspired informed wise generation- somehow that looks very unlikely bearing in mind what this chap does is now considered a job.

The upsetting fact (for the Alarmists) is that CO2 always follows Heating peaks by 700 to 1000 years. CO2 is therefore the result of Heating and NOT the cause.

"Doug Berrett","2021-10-08T02:33:16Z","What unadulterated crap.   Why have none of the alarmist’s predictions come true?   All of the so called evidence, like more powerful storms, heat waves, floods, etc., are within the range of naturally occurring events.  So they can claim their proclamations of doom are accurate.    Doubt that the events claimed to fulfill their nonsense predictions are actually normal? Try explaining how 1936, 1934, 1921, and 1901 were very hot.  All of them before the CO2 levels were high.  Forest fires were much bigger back then too.  Many tropical cyclones were bigger back then also.   
The alarmists are doing their best to scare weak minded people into destroying Western Civilization.  
One need not be a climate scientist to see that the claims of the alarmists are lies.   One only needs to actually watch what they do.   Here are three “tells.”   Before listing the tells, let us review the claims made by the alarmists.   They say CO2 is so dangerous that we only have x number of years to stop it.  Of course x number of years depends on who the alarmist is.  Beginning in 1989 it was 10 years until Arctic Ice was gone.  Then it was moved to 2013, 2014, and now out to 2035.   They say global warming will cause crop failure.  People will starve by the thousands.  Storms will be worse.  Hot places will get hotter, cold places will get colder.  Basically the world, as we know it, will cease to exist.  Such doom and gloom.  
So if CO2 will cause all this, why do they oppose known ways to reduce CO2, and still have plentiful, reliable, and inexpensive energy?
The first tell.  They oppose building new hydroelectric plants, and even have shut some down.  Hydroelectric does not emit CO2, but it does generate electricity.   
The second tell.  They oppose the enhanced recovery technique that makes it possible to generate electricity using natural gas rather than coal.  This switch lowered the CO2 emissions of the US by a large amount.   This enhanced recovery technique allows copious amounts of gas to be extracted from shale.   It is called Fracking.  A contraction of hydraulic fracturing.   
Some say fracking is unsafe.   Really?  Compared to their doom and gloom?  How can a rare Fracking problem possibly compare to their doomsday scenario?  They oppose it with gusto!  Why would anyone do that IF CO2 is SO dangerous?
Third tell.   Most of the alarmists and their legions of useful idiots are also violently opposed to nuclear.   Nuclear has the capacity to produce all the electricity we need and with the exception of CO2 produced in making the reactors etc., generates zip, zero, nada CO2.   
But nuclear is too dangerous the alarmists cry.   Really?  Which one of the three nuclear accidents have caused droughts?   Which one caused more severe storms?  Which one has caused major forest fires, or crops to fail?   None of them have!
But what about the waste.  Modern nuclear reactors are more efficient that early ones.  The fuel can even be recycled.   The waste from a modern reactor can power a medium sized city for a year and produce enough waste to fill a shoe box.   There is ample area to store this for the foreseeable future.  
To me it is obvious the goal of the alarmists is not “saving the planet!”   Many of you need to wise up before it is too late!"
"Tim K","2021-10-07T15:45:56Z","I appreciate the video, but the assertion climate change was established by oil industry scientists in the 1970s is wildly inaccurate.  Fourier described the basic atmospheric physics in the 1820s.  Tyndale showed the connection to gases like CO2 and water vapor in 1862.  Arrhenius wrote about the warming effect of greenhouse gases accumulating as a consequence of burning fossil fuels in the 1890s.  Keeling started tracking the relentless increase in CO2 in the 1950s.  None of this is new, although it did take until the 1970s until there was, by any reasonable measure, scientific consensus in Anthropogenic Climate Change."

"ZigZagHockey","2021-10-06T04:36:51Z","Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant nor, by any stretch of the facts, is it a primary cause of global warming, the amount or warming it causes is minute. The Earth has warmed (from all causes including coming out of the last Ice-Age, which we are still in - there is ice covering the polar regions ) O.8°C in the last 100 years  The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, there because of human activity, is estimated to be (even by the alarmist's own figures) 0.016%. The huge cost (trillions of dollars) of removing that 0.016% would harm plant life and possibly (not certainly) reduce global temperature by about 0.1°F fifty years from now.

The main pollutant arising from the burning of fossil fuels is sulphur dioxide, which  has for a long time been 'scrubbed' or filtered out of industrial and vehicle emissions.  The UK by means of the Clean Air Acts prohibited the burning of coal and coke in open domestic fires back in the 1950's. Getting cleaner air had nothing at all to do with reducing carbon dioxide."

* At twice the current level of400ppm,  greenhouse experiments have shown plant growth to double in output. At present CO2 levels, current world food yield has never been higher.
*CO2 is in fact a colourless tasteless odourless gas and an essential part of the carbon life cycle.
* Earth history shows that CO2 and temperature rise have been totally out of sync. i.e. a false correlation.
* Methane gas emitted from livestock has been demonized by vegans as a major cause of climate change. Stock Farms have been raided and fences destroyed as part of their agenda.
* No one is denying inefficient industrial processes and use of energy in some countries nor the dumping of plastics and other waste and the clearing of rainforests, all side issues that needs to be addressed.
* No predictions in the last 50 years ftom climate models and alarmists have ever eventuated.
* Despite claims from the alarmists,  sea level records recorded at fort Denison in Sydney Harbour have actually showing a slight decrease in the past 100 years. 
* The IPCC is a world wide organisation setup whose SOLE AGENDA is to study climate change. How much funding would they receive if their results revealed negligible or normal variations?
 * ""the science is in"" : 97% of scientists agree, but is it?  The claim is more fiction than fact. Cook et al, Uni of Q,  read not the actual papers, but the abstracts of about 11,000 so-called science papers that included the words ""climate change"" in them. On closer inspection, the papers selected, came from a broad spectrum of academics and not surprisingly failed to include  papers from sceptics like Patrick Moore, Ray Spencer, Tony Heller, Michael Plimer, and a dozen others, highly qualified to speak on the subject. It appears that if you want tenure or funding on a certain agenda then toe the party line. Just word your criteria  or questions in such a way to achieve a predetermined outcome..""Do u believe in Climate change?"". ""Do u think man has contributed to it""? What should we really be asking? What about CO2, is it a pollutant or food for plants, is a 0.01% increase significant,  unexpected, unusual or beneficial, has it made the world greener, improved crop production, provided energy for wealth production, life expectancy…?."
"Gerry Denaro","2021-11-03T23:09:24Z","FACT CHECK: anyone can have opinions on climate change but they can't have their own facts.
* Demonising of carbon is the basis of a change to a new world order: mostly a secular, economic,  left wing political and wealth distribution agenda.  (Small island governors at the current summit are smugly saying ""give us the money"") 
* NASA has in fact fudged their data reducing average temperature rises in the 90s and increasing it in the 2000s with the intent of showing an exponential temperature rises. (see their 1990s graph vs. current)
* Fear mongers allege the 1⁰C rise in the past 100 years is due solely to a man-made   rise of 0.01% in  carbon dioxide 300-400ppm
* Their modelling totally ignores 400% rise in global population, the 40% increase in the life expectancy, the 40% reduction in rainforest (lungs of the Earth), 40 -60% increase in Urban populations in the past 100 years
* Making people think of carbon (that black Sooty substance in the ground) rather than a colourless, tasteless, odourless gas like the PLANT FOOD CO2 is a clever LIE to cause fear and anguish in a gullible, uneducated population.
* Without atmospheric carbon dioxide above 200 ppm  all of life will begin to die. It is the basis of all plant growth and therefore all life on earth.

"Mark Kettlewell","2021-10-28T14:41:03Z","@-GinΠΓ Τάο Well axial tilt does a lot to keep the water masses circulating nutrients. The meeting of cold water bodies from the poles rich in oxygen and nutrients displace the warmer water masses in the tropics. These warm water masses are nutrient deserts so without continued circulation caused by the Coriolis effect our planet would be come banded in to oxic and anoxic rings. The rotation of the earth is a factor as well as the minor effect of the moons gravity affecting tides. The earth in relatively recent times (a few million years) was like a beautifully crafted Swiss Watch everything working together in biological harmony, until the advent of mankind who have broken the fragile equilibrium. Now on a geological time scale this was not always the case. The earth in it’s 4.5 Billion Year history has been just about everything from a molten poisonous volcanic inferno all the way through to becoming and ice covered snowball. Due to global tectonics the earths crust has been raised up from and subducted into the mantle many times with only a few vestiges of this original crust still extant today. We have been bombarded by a massive planet size object that created and formed our moon, the remains of that collision orbit between Jupiter and Mars as the Asteroid belt. The Pacific Ocean covers the hole that was caused by this. There have been six major extinctions between the Precambrian and the present. The most notable of these were the huge extinction event known as the ‘Great dying’ where 90 % of all life on earth was wiped out. This happened at the end of the Permian and the beginning of the Triassic. The second was the huge meteorite impact that wiped out 75% of all life at the end of the Cretaceous, taking with it the dinosaurs, ammonites and many of the primitive gymnosperm plant life. Since then furry rat like mammals evolved in what is known as the Tertiary and with the loss of the predominant ferns and gymnosperms, angiosperms ( flowering plants) became the predominant plant type. During this period the continents moved into the configuration we recognise today. The major ice ages ended the Tertiary and we live in the Holocene/anthropocene. Now for the first time in our planets vast history an organism has arisen that has ability to change our planet and not for the better, man. The earth will survive but we will not. If anything intelligent comes after us they will notice a thin band of radioactive fossilised plastics which will be the only relic that we ever existed, and maybe the odd rare bone. For all our hubris and fury this will be what is left."

In God's Word you can look to chapters 20,21,22 in the book of Revelation.  Within these chapters and other chapters throughout the Bible explain what will happen with this current earth irregardless of what man says about what will happen to this earth.

(Rising Sea Levels or stupid Politicians?) The politicians in California are so insane they actually need to vote on what to do with this water flying out to sea. In 1928 Admiral Byrd went to the Arctic Region and began blasting 50 gallon barrels of TNT inside the ice caps, & the ice sheets. The ice obviously began to break. Over the last three decades industrialists continued damaging the ice caps & ice sheets with continued Fracking for whatever reason. The Arctic ice has different layers. The lower Ice is made of salt water ice, it's much colder than the upper freshwater ice layers. This blasting and fracking caused the upper freshwater ice to melt into the lower salt water ice and forced a warming trend of the Arctic ice. It's much easier to ignore the repair and preach doomsday for profit. The Industrialists who started the man made global climate change should also be allowed to pay for the cost of the repair of the Arctic Regions. About a one quarter mile thick layer of salt spread across the top of the Arctic Region would force the ice to repair itself. 
Fact 1} Doomsday is a belief infrastructure.
Fact 2} Geothermal patterns have been wreaking havoc on Antarctica for centuries.
Fact 3} Antarctic ice has endured for at least 2.7 million years, that means it has survived roughly two complete Ice Ages and at least one Global Warming Change.
Fact 4} Despite the media hype, fear mongering for profit, etc...it will be fifty million years before the ice is completely gone in Antarctica, and then it can be said the Earth is free of any glaciers.
Fact 5} Antarctica has always contracted and expanded, while losing methane gas for over two million years.
Fact 6} The Antarctic Ice has doubled in size since 2015 and a person would have to be mentally disordered to believe that Antarctica will melt into the sea within one year.
Fact 7} The industrialists who started fracking the ice caps and the ice sheets to allow the upper freshwater ice melt into the lower salt water ice started the climate change.
Fact 8} Those Industrialists should be allowed to pay for the cost of the repair.
Fact 9} Salt can and should be spread across the entire Arctic surface.
Fact 10}Fear mongering for profit is easier than repairing it.
Fact 11} On Earth there is more water than land.

You use the juice without returning anything, pathetic is what the planet would say, if it had words to speak with. Who's the trader now? My topographic research (because I model 3D environments for racing games), has lead me to the conclusion, that there are seasons in seasons. And what we are occurring (actually caused, because we didn't plant trees, you stupid fucks.) is that we might experience a new ice age pretty soon, meaning many people will die, because their hearts will not withstand the sudden change. All of this could be avoided, if we fix the greenhouse gass effect. Meaning, we must keep it under control, but how can you keep it under control if you kill off all the natives, who know the secrets to speaking with the land. I am not  blaming anyone, but if americans polluted the air, maybe its now time to listen to the natives? Sure you invaded the land, but that's how things are now, ghost towns and pollution.

""Human activities emit 60 or more times the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes each year. Large, violent eruptions may match the rate of human emissions for the few hours that they last, but they are too rare and fleeting to rival humanity’s annual emissions. In fact, several individual U.S. states emit more carbon dioxide in a year than all the volcanoes on the planet combined do.

Volcanic v. human emissions of CO2
On the scale of carbon dioxide emissions, human sources far outweigh volcanoes. NOAA Climate.gov cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh.

Human activities
Human activities—mostly burning of coal and other fossil fuels, but also cement production, deforestation and other landscape changes—emitted roughly 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, more than 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide have been added to the atmosphere by human activities according to the Global Carbon Project.

Volcanic versus anthropogenic CO2 emissions
Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, human emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and cement production (green line) have risen to more than 35 billion metric tons per year, while volcanoes (purple line) produce less than 1 billion metric tons annually. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Burton et al., 2013.

Volcanoes
Volcanoes emit carbon dioxide in two ways: during eruptions and through underground magma. Carbon dioxide from underground magma is released through vents, porous rocks and soils, and water that feeds volcanic lakes and hot springs. Estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes have to take both erupted and non-erupted sources into account.

Mount Merapi degassing
Much of the carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is emitted by degassing of subterranean magma when the volcano is not erupting. In this photo, volcanic gases and steam rise from Mount Merapi, Indonesia, on May 20, 2012. Creative Commons license by Jimmy McIntyre.

In a 2011 peer-reviewed paper, U.S. Geologic Survey scientist Terry Gerlach summarized five previous estimates of global volcanic carbon dioxide emission rates that had been published between 1991 and 1998. Those estimates incorporated studies reaching back to the 1970s, and they were based on a wide variety of measurements, such as direct sampling and satellite remote sensing. The global estimates fell within a range of about 0.3 ± 0.15 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, implying that human carbon dioxide emissions were more than 90 times greater than global volcanic carbon dioxide emissions.

Mount Saint Helens erupting
On May 18, 1980, Mount Saint Helens experienced an explosive eruption, sending a column of ash, steam, and gases up to 60,000 feet above sea level. For about nine hours, carbon dioxide emissions from the volcano may have matched human emissions, but such massive eruptions are rare and fleeting. U.S. Geological Survey photo by Robert Krimmel.

In 2013, another group of scientists—Michael Burton, Georgina Sawyer, and Domenico Granieri—published an updated estimate using more data on carbon dioxide emissions from subsurface magma that had become available in the years since the last global estimate. While acknowledging a large range of variability in the estimates, the authors concluded that the best overall estimate was about 0.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.

While higher than Gerlach's estimate, the figure is still just a fraction of carbon dioxide output from human activities. Gerlach remarked via email, “Taken at face value, their result implies that anthropogenic CO2 exceeds global volcanic CO2 by at least a factor of 60 times.”

Occasionally, eruptions are powerful enough to release carbon dioxide at a rate that matches or even exceeds the global rate of human emissions for a few hours. For example, Gerlach estimated that the eruptions of Mount St. Helens (1980) and Pinatubo (1991) both released carbon dioxide on a scale similar to human output for about nine hours. Human emissions of carbon dioxide continue day after day, month after month, year after year.

Today versus the past
Volcanic activity today may pale in comparison to the carbon dioxide emissions we are generating by burning fossil fuels for energy, but over the course of geologic time, volcanoes have occasionally contributed to global warming by producing significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

For example, some geologists hypothesize that 250 million years ago, an extensive flood of lava poured continually from the ground in Siberia perhaps hundreds of thousands of years. This large-scale, long-lasting eruption likely raised global temperatures enough to cause one of the worst extinction events in our planet's history. Current volcanic activity doesn't occur on the same massive scale.

Climate cooling
Today, rather than warming global climate, volcanic eruptions often have the opposite effect. That's because carbon dioxide isn't the only thing that volcanoes inject into the atmosphere. Even small eruptions often produce volcanic ash and aerosol particles.


Taken by astronauts from the Space Shuttle in early August 1991, this photo of the Earth's limb shows the double layer of volcanic aerosol particles (interpretation from Self et al., 1999) that spread through the stratosphere following the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Encircling the globe at altitudes even higher than the tops of thunderstorm clouds, the particles reflected so much incoming sunlight that global surface temperatures cooled off for two years. Photo courtesy NASA JSC's Gateway to Astronaut Photography of the Earth.

Whether from small or large eruptions, volcanic aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, cooling global climate. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora produced enough ash and aerosols to cancel summer in Europe and North America in 1816.

Also, when you have manufacturing giants from the East emitting tons of carbon, don’t matter how much you pay in carbon taxes, it won’t reduce the emission levels. Remember when Australia implemented a carbon tax to help reduce emissions? Yeah what happened afterwards?"

First, we can never slow climate change. Our plant has been changing for billions of years. It is sad to listen to people posture about an impossibility. Please note, even in this video, the first terminology was global warming. Now it is climate change. See the switch?!?! Since the earth is always changing, CO2 can always be the culprit! 

Second, I noticed that you penned this 10 months ago. We were in a global lockdown, if you remember. Not in the most optimistic reality, would the entire world reduce carbon emissions at the same time. I don’t have a firm number, but I suspect that the reduction was at least 20% and likely much more. Spend a moment and see how that has affected the global CO2 in the atmosphere. It did NOTHING. If 20% doesn’t register, what would 100% register? Next to nothing! 

Third, the human contribution to annual CO2 is less than 5% of the total gain. If we stopped all carbon fuels, the global population would be reduced to the pre industrial level of 1 billion people, we will cut trees down to heat and cook, no plastics for anything, all of the luxuries we are now so accustomed to would be gone, life expectancy would drop significantly. If you believe this is a future you’re living for, keep fighting carbon fuels. Personally, I like living in a house, with running hot water, with lights air conditioning and all the rest.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Strong

The IPCC was created in 1988 largely due to the efforts of Maurice Strong, a oil, gas and power billionaire and self-confessed socialist, as part of a larger campaign to justify giving the United Nations the authority to tax businesses in developed countries and redistribute trillions of dollars a year to developing nations. 

Strong had previously succeeded in bringing about the creation of the UN Environment Programme in 1972 and served as its first executive director. The IPCC is a joint project of that entity and the World Meteorological Organization.

(Strong was subsequently implicated in corruption surrounding the UN’s Oil-for-Food-Program and has resigned from his UN positions. 
According to John Izzard writing for the Australian publication Quadrant Online,  “Following his exposure for bribery and corruption in the UN’s Oil-for-Food scandal Maurice Strong was stripped of many of his 53 international awards and honours he had collected during his lifetime working in dual role of arch conservationist and ruthless businessman.

https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2015/12/discovering-maurice-strong/

A superb political operator, in 1972 he set up a UN “Environment Conference” in Stockholm, to declare that the Earth’s resources were the common inheritance of all mankind. They should no longer be exploited for the benefit of only a few countries, at the expense of poorer countries across the globe.

To pursue this, he became founding director of a new agency, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and in the Eighties he took up the cause of a tiny group of international meteorologists who had come to believe that the world faced catastrophic warming. In 1988, UNEP sponsored this little group into setting up the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

In 1992, now allied with the IPCC, Strong pulled off his greatest coup when he set up another new body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to stage that colossal “Earth Summit” over which he presided in Rio, arranging for it to be attended not only by 108 world leaders and 100,000 others but also by 20,000 UN-funded “green activists”.

It is the UNFCCC which in effect has dictated the global climate change agenda ever since. Almost yearly it has staged huge conferences, notably those at Kyoto (1997), Copenhagen (2009) and the present one in Paris. And all along it has been Strong’s ideology, enshrined at Rio in “Agenda 21”, which has continued to shape the entire process, centred on the principle that the richer developed countries must pay for a problem they created, to the financial benefit of all those “developing countries” that have been its main victims.

In 2005, Strong was caught having been illicitly paid $1 million from the UN’s Oil for Food programme, supposedly set up to allow Saddam Hussein to pay in oil to feed starving Iraqis. He retired to a flat in Beijing, where he had been close to China’s Communist leaders back to Mao. It was from there that he returned home to Canada to die,on November 27.

""Strong’s dream is more than ever falling apart""

To this day, global climate policy is still shaped by Strong’s Agenda 21, as was highlighted last February when Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican Marxist now head of the UNFCCC and organiser of the Paris conference, urged that the West should give “$1 trillion a year” to the “developing” world.

But the wonderful irony is that the reason why Paris will fail, like Copenhagen before it, is that those “developing countries”, led by China and India – now the world’s first and third largest “CO2 emitters” – have not the slightest intention of curbing their emissions. It is for the West to do that, for creating “the problem”. Thus, just as he died, Strong’s dream is more than ever falling apart – thanks to those very countries his socialist vision was intended to help.

Sadly, this is not the case. Unfortunately, the IPCC (which has no scientific basis for their publications and warnings) is pushing the agenda, and agenda which is causing a severe policy shift.

We are damaging the world. This much is certainly true. But it is not CO2 which is the issue.

So how does a car work differently ? it doesn't , it's only reasonable to a human mind that you put petrol and after a combustion the result is no longer petrol , it's kinetic energy (moving the car) and the excess or better said the energy that was not transformed in movement . If the transfer were 100% (only on paper is actually do-able) then you would put petrol , it would burn and move the car , and you would have no exhaust . But ICE's have a maximum of around 20% efficiency . That means that if you put 100 L of fuel , only ~20L get transformed into kinetic en. .  How many of the 7-8 bil humans think about this ?

Also sea levels didn't rise as much either over that period! Al Gore said the polar ice caps will be gone by 2013 (Associated press Dec 14th 2008). Nasa said by 2018 (Guardian Feb 24 2004). I haven't checked recently but I think they are still there??? The benefits of having more Co2 far out weigh the benefits of trying to cut emissions because the more co2 we have the better the yield of crops and more food to feed a growning population! A well known scientist who is an expert on Co2 believes that it would greatly inhance vegetation yield with little or no effect upon the climate.
We don't have as many famines (caused by drought) as we used to back in the 60's & 70's, the last very big one was 1985, but we will still have them due to the natural cycle in climate.
Lets make a prediction shall we!!.... More and more hysteria will be feed to the media claiming that every weather event like flooding, forest fires, heatwaves and drought etc.. will all be blamed on global warming regardless if these events are just a natural phenonenom like El Nino or increased Sun activity etc..  I predict that political decsions around global warming will cause more harm than any global warming in and of itself will ever do.

I realized this way back when there wasn't even a discussion on this rarely discussed positive thing with increased co2. I looked at old photographs (1800 century) from my country Bosnia & Herzegovina, it's what made me realize this. The hills on these looked almost barren, and it wasn't that people used these steep hills to cut wood. It just wasn't as super lush, and abundant as today becasue co2 is a fertilizer and building block for plants. So my question is if there is anything positive from increased Co2 in the atmosphere? Climate alarmism has become like a anxiety disorder in some people really, and they just love projecting this meaningless, useless anxiety on other people, as if this anxiety will solve the issue. According to them there is not a single positive thing with our current state when there actually IS and will be MORE positives from a warmer climate. Increased crop output, longer growth season and huge new areas that can be cultivated in northern Asia and Canada among other things. After all 85% of earths existence planet Earth was in a greenhouse climatic state, which means there were no ice caps (thru earths history there are extremely rare phenomenons) , the coldest temperature was 0 degrees Celsius and most earth had a tropical and subtropical climate because better continent arrangement and current flow... I don't thing this warmhouse state is ideal for humanity because of less land areas but I'm just saying."

"larry philby","2021-09-28T05:46:59Z","@Armel Mahmutovic101 I didn't say the ocean wasn't rising. It is not rising at the alarming rate the Climate Hysterics claim. Moreover, since the land is not static, various places on the earth see different rates of rise. In some places, the sea level is falling, because the land is rising. In some places the land is rising at the same rate as the ocean, so there is no apparent change in sea level at all. In some cases the land is sinking, so sea level is rising faster there - though still at a small rate. The state of California (noted for Climate Hysteria) claims the sea level will rise several feet in just a few decades, which is utter nonsense, but they have set up an agency to deal with this ""crisis"". (They have never heard of King Canute there, I suppose.)
The ocean has been rising ever since the end of the Ice Age. There is a tide gauge at the Battery, the southern tip of Manhattan Island.  It has been taking readings since the 1850s, before Lincoln was President. It shows a steady rise in sea level for 170 years. The rate has not changed in all that time, just a slow small rise every year. New York is not about the slip below the waters of the Hudson any time soon."
"larry philby","2021-09-27T11:20:54Z","@Andrea Barone Most of what you say is based on the Climate Hysteria and not factual.
All green plants eat CO2, not just trees - your lawn does, too. The ocean is not rising at an alarming rate. The ocean is not acidic - salt water is slightly alkaline to begin with. Coral reefs are not vanishing. Storms are not increasing in number or strength. The Arctic Ocean is not ice free. The climate is always changing. 
Take a deep breath and do some research."

"Zachary Dunn","2021-07-20T23:57:33Z","""Claims of unprecedented carbon-dioxide levels ignore most of Earth’s 4.6-billion-year history. Relative to Earth’s entire record, carbon-dioxide levels are at historically low levels; they only appear high when compared to the dangerously low levels of carbon dioxide that occurred in Earth’s very recent history. The geologic record reveals carbon dioxide has almost always been in Earths’ atmosphere in much greater concentrations than it is today. For example, 600 million years ago, when history’s greatest birth of new animal species occurred, atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations exceeded 6,500 parts per million (ppm) — an amount that’s 17 times greater than it is today.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently only 410 parts per million. That means only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide (compared to 0.03 percent one century ago). Only one molecule in 2,500 is carbon dioxide. Such levels certainly do not pose a health risk, as carbon-dioxide levels in our naval submarines, which stay submerged for months at a time, contain an average carbon-dioxide concentration of 5,000 ppm.

The geologic record is important because it reveals relationships between carbon-dioxide levels, climate, and life on Earth. Over billions of years, the geologic record shows there is no long-term correlation between atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels and Earth’s climate. There are periods in Earth’s history when carbon dioxide concentrations were many times higher than they are today, yet temperatures were identical to, or even colder than, modern times. The claim that fossil-fuel emissions control atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations is also invalid, as atmospheric concentrations have gone up and down in the geological record, even without human influence.

The absurdity of climate alarmism claims gets even stranger when you consider there are 7.5 billion people on our planet who, together, exhale 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, which is almost 10 percent of total fossil-fuel emissions every year. However, we are but a single species. Combined, people and all domesticated animals contribute 10 billion tons.

Further, 9 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions from all living things arise not from animals, but from anaerobic bacteria and fungi. These organisms metabolize dead plant and animal matter in soil via decay processes that recycle carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The grand total produced by all living things is estimated to be 440 billion tons per year, or 13 times the amount of carbon dioxide currently being produced by fossil-fuel emissions. Fossil-fuel emissions are less than 10 percent of biological emissions. Are you laughing yet?""- Excerpt from an article written by Jay Lehr (Internationally renowned scientist and Senior Policy Advisor with the International Climate Science Coalition and Senior Science Analyst at CFACT) and Tom Harris (Executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition.)"

•	Develop factories that mass produce equipment that makes green hydrogen gas (H2), and green liquid ammonia (NH3).
•	Develop factories that mass produce generation 4 nuclear reactors, and automate the construction of nuclear reactor buildings.
The $10B/yr initiative automates, to the extent required, to make green energy cheaper than carbon-based fuels. This gets us worldwide decarbonization, since customers will buy green to save money. And this gets us capital market participation, which means banks and bond markets will pay for green energy power stations, and factories that supply them.

"1000frolly PhD","2021-07-08T12:31:11Z","It's rubbish and does not happen in the real atmosphere. There is no such thing as a ""Greenhouse Effect"".

In the real atmosphere, increasing CO2 doesn't and can't increase the temperature of the troposphere in any measurable way. In other words, the climate sensitivity is essentially zero.

Only an increase in insolation, an increase in surface pressure, an increase in molar mass, or a decrease in atmospheric density will increase the surface temperature significantly.

My videos explain why in fine detail; it's because there is no 'greenhouse gas warming effect' and there is no special group of gases called 'greenhouse gases' which can cause anomalous warming of the atmosphere. Neither of these exist on any planet - including Earth.

If you are wondering; yes, I'm a climate scientist, a PhD in climate science.

All you are doing is parroting the stuff they have filled your head with at Uni.
All of it is about radiative interations - but radiative interactions only dominate heat transfer in the mesosphere and the statosphere - not in the troposphere.

We live in the troposphere, and there heat transfer is totally dominated by convection.

Convection occurs in the parts of all planetary atmospheres which are over a pressure of 10kPa. This causes convection and a thermal gradient to appear.
- Robinson, T. D., & Catling, D. C. (2014). Common 0.1 [thinsp] bar tropopause in thick atmospheres set by pressure-dependent infrared transparency. Nature Geoscience, 7(1), 12-15.


This gradient leads to a surface thermal enhancement, which is the 'residual warming' effect wrongly attributed to ""greenhouse gases' by the climate scientists of the 1980's.

The residual warming effect is the difference between the effective temperature and the measured surface temerature.

You need to read my papers then all this radiative stuff will be seen as what it is; irrelevant with regards to temperature in thick atmosphere's like Earth's.

Regards,
Dr Robert Ian Holmes"
"Kloko Loko","2021-07-19T17:46:56Z","@1000frolly PhD  ""I guess that would make you happy. ""
No, it won't because I said I do not think so that you are bad person.
It's unfortunate that you lose your job.

You know that gases with more than 2 atoms can vibrate on long infrared radiation and slow down cooling of the planet because when you have nothing, like on moon, energy transfer (cooling) is the highest.

Gases with more than 2 atoms like H2O, CO2, CH4, N2O block some of the IR radiation spectrum (from earth to space)so earth can't cool it self so fast and to get on new temp. equilibrium earth heats up and since now hotter earth radiate stronger, energy IN and energy OUT is again the same but at higher global temp.

When you accept that and fact that pressure of the earth is consequence of sun energy (or less cooling). and not the opposite you will get it.

If you want to increase pressure or temp. you must put energy into the system and that energy is from the sun but you omit that energy in the system can increase in 2 major ways, stronger sun or slower cooling of the planet.

You do understand that energy from the sun is almost all in form of light, average wave length of 550nm and  when sun hits water surface (90% of planet heat absorption) that light is transformed into heat that radiate back to space at totally different frequency spectrum at average wave length of 10 000nm (10um) and  all gases pass sun light and  heat from earth to space BUT those that have more than 2 atoms block some of that IR radiation so you have slower cooling of the planet.

So energy goes in without problem  BUT it can't go out without problems.

When earth heats up either from stronger sun or higher GHGas effect, pressure on earth goes up because now you have 7% more water vapor in air for every 1°C and again ideal gas law condition are realized.
Also albedo and other things, like clouds have an effect.
Clouds also can block IR and reflect light but if they are dark they absorb light.
Water vapor and clouds are two different things.

Put that into formula.

Temp and pressure is closely correlated and one always affect the other.

You can change pressure with higher gravitation but this is constant and only with more energy IN or less energy OUT you can increase global temp. and consequently pressure.

This is just like I say that fever is cause of virus so you must avoid heat wave and not that virus is cause of your fever.
This is how is on our planet because gravity is constant .


And be sure to buy those low emissivity glass windows, they also have argon inside for lower thermal conduction, but most of the saving is because low e coating.  

Again https://youtu.be/wfs2WvwujqY

Low emissivity silver coating is so thin that pass light but do not pass IR radiation from your room, so cooling of your room is reduced and  energy loss is up to 3 times less than from conventional double glassing windows. It is not much if other parts of your home is not well thermally insulated but if they are you can save 25% on energy for heating.

Also investigate how this works too https://youtu.be/rtm1dnUR0wo"

All you have is a blind belief in a dogma, the dogma of an incorrect null hypothesis of climate, invented in the 1980's by dolts like James Hansen.
There is a thermal surface enhancement, but this is cauased by simple gas thermodynamics in our thick atmosphere - a natural thermal gradient

"Smon the Vidd","2021-06-26T14:19:25Z","Guys, I want to challenge the early stuff here. I learnt about the greenhouse effect at school in the 1970's. I never heard anything at all which challenged the idea until a became a youtube junkie a couple of years ago. 
What I observed was that whenever renewables began to be financially viable, the oil price would mysteriously come down. Also, the motor industry started to produce more fuel efficient cars as though this was somehow an attempt to reduce the use of fossil fuels - but, again, it just kicked renewables further down the road.
The 2008 crash meant putting the whole eco thing to one side.
And the rapid growth of China and of India was fuelled by coal. So we just watched on the side lines, dutifully taking the metro to work instead ot the car, in the hope that would make some difference.
Then only recently I began to learnt about solar activity and its affect. I also began to come across the idea that the areas of land covered with ice were not always covered with ice. Then, that there was more C02 in the atmosphere in the past and the there is an effect called global greening which is a result of having a better level of atmospheric C02 which may be useful for feeding a growing population.
And while sea levels rise, vast area of land area are also made available because they are no longer covered with ice.

Nevertheless, I do find the behaviour of EXXON shocking. As you say, they could have gone for diversification of energy. 

But here is the issue. Believing in man made climate change does not change anything. You can give yourself a pat on the back for having 'sound doctrine' but it doesn't actually change the reality. It may be that you can't do anything of any signficance. Okay. But I would rather be a little sceptical but address the issue than be a 'believer' in 'the science' and sit in some ivory tower lecturing every one on how wrong they all are."

If man has anything to do with global warming or could change global warming we would have done it by now. We've had the technology for electric cars long before the internal combustion engine since the seventies how many electric cars are on the road today. Since the 70s the only thing that government has done was taxes at the pump it made us missions on our cars which literally makes you burn more gas no I'm no scientist but Common Sense would have to say that if you're burning more gas you're putting more hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. Another thing that we could do maybe stop. Cutting down thousands of Acres of rainforest everyday since trees are what help suck up CO2 and converts it to oxygen"

"Stuart Keeton","2021-07-14T17:22:32Z","@Kloko Loko I've never heard Dr. Happer say anything about CO2 being saturated, but I have heard him say we were in a CO2 drought, and adding some to our atmosphere would be not be a climate catastrophe. Dr. Happer Is not a climatologist, but he is a physicist and knows a lot about CO2. Climatologist need government funding and in order to get what they need, they have to go along with the alarmist view.  Dr. Happer agrees that adding CO2 to the atmosphere will raise temps, but you would have to double the amount to raise the temps by 1 degree, but humans only account for 3% of what is added each year. That means 97% of the CO2 added each year is natural. Have you seen the NASA photos of the Earth and how it is greening. So some of the additional CO2 is being used to green the Earth. How can that be bad. These are unprecedented times of life and longevity on earth. The USA had the best long term temp data and if you look at the data before the alarmist started adjusting it to match their projections, you'll find the 30's were the hottest decade in the US,  but there have been ups and downs all along the way. No we're not in a climate emergency, it's just easier to manipulate the public if the powers that be can keep the public in fear of something all the time. Hobgoblins and such won't get us, but panic and alarmism just might!"
"Kloko Loko","2021-07-12T22:26:54Z","That guy is not climatologist and his colleagues from Princeton University that are climatologist reject his explanation about ""CO2 is saturated"" so therefore can't increase global temp. like false hypothesis.

This is true, but there's no use for many times the CO2 levels if there's not enough nitrogen in the soil to go with it and heat stress is also a thing that would limit plant production for many plant species. If you'd ask your average neighbourhood plant what they'd prefer, they'd probably prefer now to dinosaur times. ""Maybe just as dangerous is the population explosion and subsequent destruction of habitat"" Yes habitat destruction is extremely bad. It is an underrepresented problem, imo. I disagree with your idea that it won't be as bad as 'doom prophets' are saying though. CC is going way too fast for most species to adapt to. Of course some species would likely survive even if we wouldn't, and life will probably return and flourish especially on a longer time scale of millions of years, but most of the species here now would die with us prematurely and they'd leave no descendants (I mean as in adapted different types of species), only because we've denied them any time to adapt."

"Daniel M","2021-06-09T06:26:49Z","@Ben Sput that is false. There is no such thing as equilibrium.
How much natural greenhouse gasses the earth produces is not a stable number. It always changes. And the amount of greenhouse gasses the earth absorbs always changes.
You are assuming things were perfectly balanced, despite the fact we are still in an ice age, and on our way out of one.
The time line used in this video is only within our current ice age, it never looked at patterns or temperatures before the ice age."

"Daniel M","2021-06-08T20:06:45Z","@Ben Sput 
Climate change is real.
But thats not the question.
We are talking about man made climate change. 
Which is also real, but its debated how much do humans contribute.
We know that humans are only responsible for less than 5% of all green house gasses, and the other 95% is natural.
And 2% of that 5% we produce is absorbed by the earth. meaning we produce 3% Net of global green houses gasses.
So the debate is based on, are we speeding it up? or having no effect.
If we follow the Paris climate agreement we will slow down climate change by 3 months, as it will happen anyway.
My opinion is that humans have no measurable effect. which explains why every singleclimate prediction ever made proves itself to be false by the predicted date. Britain should have no more snow since 2012. The great lakes should have dried up by 2019.
It's clearly not happening as fast as predicted, so it looks like humans are not speeding it up at all.
For example if i walk to the shop in my new trainers, its predicted i will get there sooner than normal. 
I should arrive in 5 minutes, not 8. But i arrive there in 8. 
Did my new trainers speed me up? or did i arrive as fast as i normally would?
The problem we have is, what has been predicted (the effects of climate change) are things that will happen despite of humans, given the time. So when when these thing eventual happen, you will see people with smug faces saying ""i told you so."" Ignoring the fact that they didnt happen in the time frame predicted therfore displays a lack of human greenhouse gass emissions, meaning humans have had no effect on the climate despite sea levels rising."

We do not yet have sufficient data to build a worthwhile climate modelling computer program for realistic calculation of climatic changes and much is to do with clouds, water vapour and other greenhouse gasses. Australia was early to build the Hornsdale green mega battery to help with going green with solar and wind power and despite our backward thinking Prime Minister. I believe we should now also be the leading nation in installing fusion nuclear. The fusion nuclear SAFIRE GENERATOR by Aureon Energy Ltd. of Canada is the actually cheapest, cleanest and least expensive solution for clean electricity. Wind energy, solar, hydro and other green technologies are now just superseded. Hydrogen will not either become a future conventional fuel but a nuclear fusion one! Electric power is the future for autonomous small aircraft and with ever more battery energy storage density perhaps some larger ones. However, FUSION NUCLEAR IS THE FUTURE of ever-larger commercial and military aircraft. Now we have a 24 hr. reliable fusion power product. We now in 2021 have super cheap nuclear fusion energy already proven and almost commercialised as in being in advanced production, that of the ""SAFIRE GENERATOR"". So sadly, storage technologies and the power from ITER-type fusion power generators as well as conventional fission nuclear are going to be eclipsed. Current magnetic plasma confinement strategies and all current green energy technologies are totally out of date and relatively redundant. All our effort must now go into EVER HIGHER ENERGY DENSITY BATTERIES because green energy is now solved. With intermittent green energies we need an enlarged electric grid, so we see wind generators, solar farms and a multitude of variable green technologies with expensive backup batteries and they are all ugly and use up much land, while also being significantly capital intensive and all while having some safety issues. They are all also going to be unnecessary with the advent of the ""SAFIRE GENERATOR"" that is safe, costlessly self-fueling, totally green, buildable on any scale on a tiny footprint to safely match local community requirement and it is easily chokeable and 24 hours dependable. It makes all other technologies redundant as in being much less advantageous. It is fusion nuclear powered by nuclear ""NUCHEMY"" and seen at ""AUREON ENERGY.COM"" of Canada. Also learn your new plasma physics, astrophysics, and general Electric Universe Theory at ""THUNDERBOLTS PROJECT.COM"". This way you can learn your new EU Theory, advanced plasma physics and all needed to fully understand all this new academic and practical material. and appreciate that all the other green technologies are currently just now superseded."

Like in a car in summer, which can become hot like a frying pan. This is what glass does, and also water vapor as you can seen when you look at absorp-tion diagrams, you see that CO2 does not absorb more infrared radiation than Oxygen:

CO2 does only block 2 frequencies, different from water vapor 20 times as much represented in the atmosphere than CO2. Water vapor behaves very much like glass in its absorption be-haviour. And: The same 2 frequencies blocked by CO2 are also blocked by the 20 times more frequent water vapor in the atmosphere. So which warming effect CO2 is supposed to have?

Drilling in the ice caps of Greenland and Antartica showed, that after ice age periods of cold the intermediate warm periods came first, the rise of CO2 only after the global warming in between of the ice ages."

"drmr miah","2021-04-17T09:27:35Z","Dear Respected All, 
From my PhD research- ISNAH Experiment, recent Climate change is nothing but misusing of wireless sensor networks. Present cutting edge technology must and must be secured, otherwise, present situation will be dangerous. For example: COVID-19, which  is a message of third world war. The coronavirus has exaggerated the entire world, which escaped the horrors of the previous World War I and II. These coronaviruses were spreading unambiguously everywhere in all countries. People are already aware that it will take months if not years to end the COVID-19 conflict, which became painfully obvious that the conflicts during world war I and II would go on and on for months and years. Both these wars were also misnomers. The World War I ended with roughly 20 million people dying, which is comparison with COVID-19 deaths [136]. The coronavirus pandemic has confirmed the disturbing potential of viruses as a weapon of mass destruction, reduction of social rapport building, distancing in religious activities, which have transformed the concentration, dimension and trajectory of an undeclared third world war and, in its aftermath, could conceivably transmit about a revolution in the global order [137]. The world is in turmoil from racial injustice to rising inequalities due to pandemic COVID-19 [138]. These World Wars were named with retrospective effect to all generations. From the higher study, it is informed that COVID-19, suddenly earthquake, tsunami, cyclone, rainfall, forest fire, building burning, load shedding, soldiers’ mutiny, plane demolish, family clash, vehicles’ accident, political instability, landslide, winter storm, building fallen down etc. have been occurred by cyber hackers due to misusing of wireless sensor networks.

There are trillions of dollars at generated through contracts delegated through the UN. The Earth has a natural carbon and glacial cycle. The whole plan for zero emissions does not matter. The problem is they want to do more than zero emissions oh, they want to generate carbon scrubbers to pull the carbon out of the air. The hypocrite climate scientists think that it's bad to contribute 0.04% of carbon emissions, because that 0.04% is manmade and not natural. Scrubbing the carbon out of the air is to bring the Earth's atmosphere down to 200 parts per million at least that is their plan. We are at 400 parts for me and now roughly, and during glacial times we are naturally at 200 parts per million. The Earth's natural carbon cycle bring CO2 levels as high as 600 parts per million and greater. At 600 parts per million plants thrive, and biodiversity regenerates on the planet. Now these climate-science Psychopaths want to bring you down to 200 parts per million, and according to their pseudoscience this means they are forcing the earth into a glacial state., and they want to sustain a glacial state; if the scientist were correct about how CO2 controls the climate. The one thing the climate scientists forget to tell you is that as glaciers melt because of the Sun and solar Cycles CO2 is released from the ice at the poles oh, it is also released from the waters during these solar Cycles because of underwater volcanic activity is activated by solar Cycles much like what happened in the 70s oh, those who are educated remember the glacial growth that happened at that time. Another thing that climate scientists do not understand is why did the CO2 collect at the poles and Glaciers that start with. The reason for this is because of the properties of carbon period carbon is an amazing element oh, and it is so useful, not just as food for the food that feeds the plants LOL. Carbon by itself is a superconductor up electricity, it is also diamagnetic. When combined with oxygen oh, that happens to be paramagnetic, this sets up the perfect electromagnetic properties that draws this amazing CO2 compound to the polar regions of the Earth.

"Daniel M","2021-06-08T20:11:11Z","Climate change is real.
But thats not the question.
We are talking about man made climate change. 
Which is also real, but its debated how much do humans contribute.
We know that humans are only responsible for less than 5% of all green house gasses, and the other 95% is natural.
And 2% of that 5% we produce is absorbed by the earth. meaning we produce 3% Net of global green houses gasses.
So the debate is based on, are we speeding it up? or having no effect.
If we follow the Paris climate agreement we will slow down climate change by 3 months, as it will happen anyway.
My opinion is that humans have no measurable effect. which explains why every singleclimate prediction ever made proves itself to be false by the predicted date. Britain should have no more snow since 2012. The great lakes should have dried up by 2019.
It's clearly not happening as fast as predicted, so it looks like humans are not speeding it up at all.
For example if i walk to the shop in my new trainers, its predicted i will get there sooner than normal. 
I should arrive in 5 minutes, not 8. But i arrive there in 8. 
Did my new trainers speed me up? or did i arrive as fast as i normally would?
The problem we have is, what has been predicted (the effects of climate change) are things that will happen despite of humans, given the time. So when when these thing eventual happen, you will see people with smug faces saying ""i told you so."" Ignoring the fact that they didnt happen in the time frame predicted therfore displays a lack of human greenhouse gass emissions, meaning humans have had no effect on the climate despite sea levels rising."

Have you ever worked on Petroleum platforms before? I haven't, I admit it, but have you? Have you worked on any contracts for them? I'm basing my assertion based on what I learned in Geosurveying and mineral extraction in university, part of my Mechanical Engineering degree.

Floating platforms do exist but are only useful and cheaper than fixed platforms in low-density mineral/oil reserves. When working on a large deposit, you NEED a fixed structure to reduce costs. The overall cost of maintaining a floating platform is significantly higher because of the stresses I mentioned.

I am sorry, I am talking crazy, there is no political or financial motivations in the scientific community.  Just like the science has spoken and that virus did not come from that lab, that was studying viruses just like the one that that is destroying millions of lives.

You know, the lab run by histories most brutal human rights abuser, that has killed millions of its own people, currently committing genocide in concentration camps and is a brutal authoritarian regime that is actively trying to destroy democracy and freedom.  So lets sum this up.  Our scientific community gives funding to create deadly viruses to a brutal murderous dictatorship that has been responsible for numerous global outbreaks and is most certainly using every single bit of this research to design biological weapons, but any scientist who wishes to perform research that does not fit the narrative is denied funding."
"Cleasia","2021-06-12T14:44:02Z","@Ian of Liverpool Hey, I'm just gonna reply in the two comments I see you copy-pasting this. Sure most CO2 emission come from natural cause, and that human's miniscule input may seem insignificant.

But, remember that the natural CO2 back then were a part of a naturally balanced system/cycle. That, before human slowly increased and affect the CO2 emissions, earth had a fragile cycle to heat and _cool_ itself down.

But now that we added more CO2 into the atmosphere, that cycle is not interrupted and the earth is indeed getting hotter at an unnatural rate. You could even say it spiked, not just increase, but _spiking_.

You could see how the graph (and CO2 emission from human causes, let the graph to spike) from these video.

A calmer, clinical, and skeptical look on climate change: https://youtu.be/uqwvf6R1_QY

A more humorous, snappy, though showed how the CO2 emission affected the atmosphere more clearly imo in this video: https://youtu.be/R7FAAfK78_M

Take your pick.

Not to mention that even if Volcanoes or what have you erupted, it _also_ releases a cooling gas (I believe it was sulphur but I could be wrong) that counters the affect of its heat while humans _doesn't_ do that. And, if we continue to let the CO2 increase, and decrease natural land (trees or what have you) to make for more housing and fuel burning without stop— that natural cycle isn't going to keep up. Leading to the greenhousing CO2 from us (and natural causes) from the years before to stack up and make the earth even warmer, which leads to more residual CO2 next year, that'll make the earth even more next year, and so on and so forth.

So, small as it may, it does tip a delicate balance for humanity and is one of the cause, the main cause, for global warming.

I hope this helps ^^."

“Another reason why the environment is such an important issue to us is that it will enable us to introduce and ratify comprehensive international treaties granting unprecedented power to seize government and private property all in the name of protecting the environment. In fact, our mandate for the future includes the imposition of stringent global environmental laws which would regulate every area of life. Toward this end we have been supporting the creation of an all-encompassing planetary document called The Earth Charter.” - Gary Kah Advisor to the UNIPCC and author of The Environmental Agenda.

"" The environmental crisis is the cornerstone for the New World Order” Maurice strong ( U.N. environmental leader and Director of Canada Oil and Natural Gas Utility) was quoted as saying, “ Isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?” James Garrison ( President of the Gorbachev Foundation ) says “we are going to end up with world government. It's inevitable... There's going to be conflict, coercion and consensus. That's all part of what will be required as we give birth to the first global civilization.”

“ World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.” - Jacques-Yves Cousteau, oceanographer and humanist, The UNESCO Courier, Nov. 1991, page 13

“Within a few years snowfall will become a very rare and exciting event….Children just aren’t gong to know what snow it.” -David Viner, Climatic Research Unit of East Anglia. 20 March 2000.ll 

“Scholars are predicting that 250million people worldwide will be displaced by 2010 because of rising sea levels, desertification, dried up aquifers, weather-induced flooding and other serious environmental changes” - 2005, Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation.

June 30, 1989, Associated Press. “UN OFFICIAL PREDICTS DISASTER, SAYS GLOBAL WARMING WILL WIPE SOME NATIONS OFF MAP- “entire nations will be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000. Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of “eco-refugees” threatening political chaos” said Brown, director the New York office of the UN Environmental Program.

""We've got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of global economic policy.  - Timothy Wirth.  IPCC

""The commitment of government to deal with the population issue is of course essential...There are many ways to make the death rate Increase. Action will necessitate a propaganda campaign of global proportions. ” - Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense, New Solidarity, March 30, 1981

“One of the least understood strategies of the world revolution now moving rapidly toward its goal is the use of crisis as a major means of obtaining the consent of the people who will be subjects of the New World Order.”
–K.M. Heaton, National Educator

Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.”
–Dr. Henry Kissinger, Evians, France, 1991

“The truth of the matter is that you do have those standby provisions, and the statutory emergency plans are there whereby you could, in the name of stopping a terror or environmental threat, apprehend, invoke the military, and even arrest Americans and hold them in detention camps.

"Rm18082","2021-03-10T11:48:17Z","If we want to effectively tackle these problems, what we need is to focus only on measures that have a real impact

1) distance tax: a tax that increases the longer the goods are shipped or transported- this incentivizes a local economy and stops the mess of goods running around the world for no reason.

2) female education- the more educated the less children they will have, as overpopulation is a huge problem

3) tackle income inequality- tax the super wealthy and the multinationals, make them pay the right share, no more tax avoidance or producing in countries with lower regulations. Big companies need the most resources and make up the biggest polluters, so local and smaller is better.

4) universal basic income so people dont have ""to make a living"" at any cost and follow their passions- no damaging, stupid or unnecessary work

5) make hemp biodiesel (and other biodiesels) make up 30% of all fuel compulsory in the economy and make investments. Tackle food waste and make it maximal 5% of all produced. Go towards 0% fossil fuels with improved technology. Swap most plastics for hemp-derived materials

6) sustainability index- make an index of the worst environmental offender-practices. Ban those that are not needed and bring within limits those that can be made sustainable. Use taxes to incentivize/disincentivize

7) go towards a bio-adapted infrastructure such as passages for the wild under highways and so forth. Go back to natural farming, drop all intensive farming, is healthier anyway. Decrease production of animal products. Abandon chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides, all not sustainable. 

8) we need a working UN back in some form, to protect areas such as the amazonas and other strategically important parts of the world for the ecology. Besides that we need first nation countries to invest in countries that are lagging behind, as the investment would yield much greater results. This is a global challenge.

9) drop all the measures that wont make any difference and accept that we cant control it 100% at this point. Maybe there are some benefits in a warmer climate too.

What happens to the liquid inside? it comes out. Now take a candle and wait till it burns, where is the smoke going up and out- now place a glass over it slowly and the heat backs up inside. Now when you are burning a kerosine lamp, you see the heat on the glass but the heat is being is vented out throw a hole around the glass. So when you enclose something like heat, sooner of later it will bounce back from what is stopping it to vent out and upwards. The heat is hitting a barrier prevented it from going out in space. What heat that has accumulated over the years has not been our fault, all this that is happening is because the ones that that use machines that produced so much heat and melted the ice,  are the ones who are responsible for the changes in our weather. The candle burning smoke goes up and disperses in the space above, but put something to prevent it and what happens? it bounces back."

Humans do not   cause CLIMATE CHANGE  it has been constantly ongoing for billions of years humans did not start it and we cant stop it, the same is true for global warming and global cooling, though human emissions are probably adding some warmth to the natural warming in in line with our TINY Co2 emissions (less than 4% of the annual total of Co2 outgassed into the atmosphere) remember there are processes which recycle Co2 out of the atmosphere and back into the planet.
This guy knows NOTHING about the science , NOTHING, he just keeps trotting out the same unsupportable BS that you get in the media.
How dare they portray a highly UNCERTAIN science as UNCERTAIN, indeed he sounds like Lady Macbeth ""Out Out Dammed spot""
What the filmmaker knows about our paleoclimate data you could fit on a postage stamp.
NO ONE EVER SAID CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT REAL, do what this ignorant and dangerously naïve  youth wants and in twenty years you will have destroyed your nation.
I saw EXACTLY the same sort of BS in the 1970's pushed by the same powerful capitalists through the Club of Rome via the U.N
then in order to prevent a human induced global climate catastrophe they wanted us to melt polar ice by sprinkling carbon black on the poles, and to build as many coal powered power stations as possible to pump as much Co2 into the atmosphere as possible thats right exactly the opposite of what they demand now.

Why, well there are a range of climate cycles over various time frames and intensity's both cooling and warmings, the short term cycles such as the bearded wonder is responding to are irregular in the time they run for (and we really dont understand the causes well)  but warming follows cooling which follows warming.

One hundred and eighty years ago we broke out of a several hundred year period of cooling (the little ice age) this had followed a period of warming at least as warm as today and quite possible warmer (the medieval warm period is one of many which seem to occur roughly every thousand years and have been much warmer in the past than now), since then we have had numerous short term cooling and warming cycles but overall it has warmed (otherwise we would still be in the Little Ice Age) the peak of the last short term warming was in the late  1930's (in fact that time period still holds the records for the most broken records for high temperatures) from 1940 (with human Co2 emissions peaking) we moved into the next part of the short term cycle COOLING it cooled from 1940 through to the 1970's, so in the 1970's they were pushing human caused climate catastrophe  GLOBAL COOLING, when we moved into the next short term cycle WARMING, then within a couple of years it was a human caused climate catastrophe GLOBAL WARMING.

So far NONE of the predicted climate disasters HAS EVER OCCURED from the 1970's till now, this issue is 90% politics and 10% science, science is being used to justify the imposition of a geopolitical agenda our governments signed us up to at the 1992 Rio Earth Conference (without our permission).

The irony is that the bearded one (who does not seem to know much climate science) attacks the oil industry but ignores that the Rockefellers (Massive Oil  producers and ruthless and powerful capitalists) set up the Club of Rome to advance their financial and geopolitical interests by using the environmental movement (the Club of Rome set up the U.N environmental department and the IPCC), in this they have been stupendously successful the AGW panic is enormously profitable for them.
So your climatically challenged narrator is doing his best to pour even bigger profits into their pockets and transfer political power from the nation state (you dont mind living in a corporate controlled socialist dictatorship do you ?) to the U.N as Global Governance (which the U.N has been pushing for years, after all that is the real reason they were set up by the Rockefellers and the international banking elite with the support of the Fabian and other socialist groups and their compliant governments).

Now i dont remember he who has glasses (he is certainly shortsighted when it comes to this issue ) ever pointing out that a Climate segment is THIRTY YEARS thats right thirty years, climate is many things but here we are using the word CLIMATE when we are really talking about Global Warming.
We will not know whether the current thirty year segment we are in has warmed/cooled or is in overall stasis for another EIGHT OR NINE YEARS, thats right its WAY too early to know what climate has done right now and wont  for years.

Going back to a recent convenient point we know it warmed from late in the 19th century (Australias hottest recorded  day was in 1909 51.7 Deg C),  till around 1940 then cooled till the 1970s, then warmed till 1998, thats what we know ALL THAT FUSS RIGHT NOW and so far nothing out of the ordinary at all, in fact a European ice core series paper published last year covering the last eight hundred years shows clearly that our current climate movements are slow  and mild compared to what has happened in only the last eight hundred years.

Perhaps EXXON were in existence then ?and were responsible for the medieval warm period, the even warmer roman warm period, the warmer still bronze age warm period etc, do you think the Trojans bought EXXON shares ? or maybe the Myceneans,
perhaps Julius Caesar had to invade Gaul to recoup the losses he made trying  on a short sell on EXXON shares ?

 There is no significance at all to the EXXON scientific reports they were hypothesis only that needed replication via empirical testing, neither necessarily wrong or right just hypothesis and on their own PROOF OF NOTHING.

Clearly Brittany Spears with the beard does not understand the concept of HYPOTHESIS, i see he has other videos UH OH HE DID IT AGAIN, i would advise potential listeners to go out and get some books from AGW proponents and AGW sceptics and form their own opinions, this guys video was a waste of space."

People tend to take Trump's claims a bit to serious , in reality he tries to misrepresent facts as much as possible.
For example , Obama became president during a financial crisis where the unemployment rate was above 10%.
At the end of his second term that unemployment rate was down to 4.7%.
Trump still managed to convince his followers that Obama was destroying the economy because they forgot to factcheck the things he says.
One of his main claims for success was the unemployment rate which was 3.9% just before Covid hit,
That is obviously still lower than 4.7% but some of that declining unemployment rate during Trump's term was from initiatives that Obama put in place.
Trump just took a lot of credit for things he didn't have much to do with."

( بحسب التقويم الرسمي لأمّ القرى )



سلامُ الله عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته يا معشر البشر الذين إذا تبيّن لهم الحقُّ اتّبعوه، كونهم يستخدمون عقولهم فلا أحد يستطيعُ أن يستخفّ بعقولهم كونهم لن يسمحوا بذلك؛ أولئك الذين هداهم الله وأولئك هم أولو الألباب في كل زمان ومكان، ولذلك تجدون الفتوى الحق من الله عن سبب دخول أهل النار في النار وهو الاستخفاف بالعقول وعدم استخدامها، تصديقاً لقول الله تعالى: {وَقَالُوا لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِي أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ ﴿١٠﴾} صدق الله العظيم [الملك].
وربما يودّ كافّة الباحثين أن يقولوا: ""ومن ذا الذي يستطيع أن يسْتَخفّ بعقولنا؟ فنحن بشر ميّزنا اللهُ عنْ الأنعامِ بِنعمة العقل، ومن لا يستخدم عقله فهو كالأنعام، فلا أنت يا ناصر محمد اليماني تستطيع أن تسْتَخِفّ بعقولنا ولا كافّة الذين يصدّون عن آيات التصديق من الله لدعوتك؛ إن كنت من الصادقين حتماً يُصدِقك الله وحدك فيصبحَ الصادّون من الكاذبين."" فمن ثمّ يقيم الإمام المهدي ناصر محمد اليماني الحجة على الجميع وأقول: اكتبوا كلمة بحث في قوقل وفي القنوات كما يلي:
""رُبّ ضارة نافعة فايروس كورونا""
وسوف تجدون أنّ علماء المناخ بما فيهم وكالة ناسا وكذلك كافّة الأساتذة والباحثين يقولون: ""إنّ فايروس كورونا استطاع أن يحقّق ما لم تحقّقه اتفاقية باريس للمناخ! كونه وقّف مصانع البشر وسياراتهم حتى خفّ عادم ثاني أوكسيد الكربون المُتصاعد إلى غلاف الكرة الأرضية؛ فهذا يعني أنّ فايروس كورونا حلّ مشكلة المناخ كونه حتماً خفّف خمسين في المائة من ثاني أوكسيد الكربون الصاعد من سكّان الأرض إلى غلافها الجويّ العلويّ، وأنّ هذا يعني أنّه خفّف كثيراً من الاحتباس الحراريّ، وأنّ هذه بُشرى."" يخفّف من كوارث الطبيعة من فيضاناتٍ وأعاصيرَ وزلازلَ وغيرها من كوارث الطبيعة الذين زعموا أنّها بسبب الاحتباس الحراري، فإذا هم يتفاجأون في صيف عشرين عشرين ما لم يكونوا يحتسبون، ولم تخفّ كوارثُ الطبيعة شيئاً بل تضاعفت الفيضانات والأعاصير البحريّة والبرّية والزلازل وغيرها بما يسمونها (كوارث التقلّبات المناخيّة) بسبب الاحتباس الحراري.
كَذّبهم الله بحوله وقوته وأفسد نظرية الاحتباس الحراري! ليعلم البشر العُقلاء أنّه حقّاً كوارث التغيّرات المناخيّة أنّها ليست بسبب الاحتباس الحراري للأرض؛ بل سببها كوكب العذاب (نيبيرو) سقر الذي يحذّر منه المهديّ المنتظر ناصر محمد اليماني منذ ستة عشر عاماً، ولذلك بعث الله فايروس كورونا ليثبت افتراءهم فينسف نظريّة الاحتباس الحراري! ليتبيّن لكافّة البشر أنّ ما يُنذر منه المهديّ المنتظر ناصر محمد اليماني منذ ستة عشر عاماً أنّ سبب حربِ اللهِ المناخيّة هي حقاً بسبب اقتراب كوكب سقر، فيحدث التناوش لحرب الله المناخيّة قبل مروره نذيرًا للبشر، فهل تناقض الإمام المهديّ ناصر محمد اليماني ؟

والصادّون عن حقائق آيات الله المجرمون يتناقضون ومُصرّون على تكبّرهم وغرورهم، ومن اتّبعهم استخفّوا بعقولهم فأضلّوهم ولن يُغنوا عنهم من عذاب الله شيئًا، والقادم أعظم، اللهم قد بلغت.. اللهم فاشهد.
وسلامٌ على المُرسَلين والحمدُ للهِ ربِّ العالمين..
خليفة الله وعبدُه الإمام المهديّ ناصر محمد اليماني.

"Tate Phelps","2021-02-12T01:33:58Z","So please explain the concept of a greenhouse, I’ll wait.....you don’t seem to comprehend it, so may I elaborate? Green houses are designed to trap c02 to rapidly increase rate at which plant life grows. This is what is happening throughout the world. We are currently terra forming it to what is natural, whether or not higher c02 is good for us shouldn’t matter as we should adapt rather than play god and alter the adequate levels of c02 that actually improves the overall health of the environment. Pretty much all of the issues as a result of climate change listed really are just due to human incompetence. Science shows that less that 2 percent of what happens with weather is actually caused by humans. The planet is going through changes as it always has and always will. Climate change is not man made, it’s a natural phenomenon."

"Alan Robertson","2021-02-11T00:04:43Z","Some facts. Historically from ice core samples the CO2 levels have risen 800 - 1400 years AFTER global warming. In the past 1 million years the CO2 levels have never been higher than 300 ppm, which they are now exceeding, but before that the CO2 levels were very much higher, up to 5000ppm. Animal evolved in this time so there is no reason to suppose that higher CO2 will lead to an extinction event or that there will be a runaway. All these facts are readily identifiable from many sources on the internet, you do not have to take my word for it.
A scientific theory or law represents a hypothesis (or group of related hypotheses) which has been confirmed through repeated testing, almost always conducted over a span of many years. Generally, a theory is an explanation for a set of related phenomena, like the theory of evolution or the big bang theory. Global warming models have not yet been able to predict the future climate so the current status is one of a hypothesis. Science must always incorporate new data. The reason that people say ""Climate science is established – we are in the midst of a climate emergency."" is for political not scientific reasons. Green policies will make everybody poorer for what is unproven and undemonstrated."
"Jan Ski","2021-02-10T22:13:06Z","Who mentioned MSR thorium reactors?"
"Toby Agerbak","2021-02-10T21:14:53Z","1) Co2 released from factories doesn't cause the greenhouse effect, it enhances it. Without the greenhouse effect earth would be almost impossible to live on, 20 degrees colder. 
2) I the 1980s renewable energy sources were barely being investigated and were nowhere near efficient energy or cost wise to justify the shift for a large company
3)I don't know all the context of this story however Milankovitch cycles do lead to extended periods of global temperature increase and decrease and it is true that an unprecedented change may not have been unambigously obvious. (still very shady business practice though and whilst evidence of this wasn't fully uncovered the theory was very clear and well backed up by other scientists)
4) Climate change IS caused by more than just human c02 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. However it does make up the majority.
5)

Please keep in mind that these are nitpicky things but its really important that amazing education channels like yours show all the facts. Love you guys!
(also please like so they can see)"
"Steve Gehrke","2021-02-10T13:40:06Z","BTW, as it turns out (you would know this if you were a scientist or able to read and interpret the scientific data on climate change) the scientist at Exxon were wrong! Yeah thats right! They were wrong, because as it turns out the emissions from burning fossil fuels does NOT contribute to the warming of the planet! And you need not take my word for it either. But get a so called scientist who is on board with the lie and dont ask him what his data shows or tells him but instead simply ask him to see his data for yourself! He wont let you! And if he des he is betting that you are not capable of reading or interpreting the data because it would tell you tat there is no evidence that says CO2 causes global warming. Its in the facts. But it is hidden and lied about! Look for yourself! Then find a few ""Denier's"" and ask them why? You will get the real reason behind warming and it is NOT man made!! In fact humans could not make such an effect on the planet if we wanted too! Its all right there IF you know how to read it!!"

"RhedinRage","2021-01-31T15:30:47Z","Co2 is not a pollutant and it's temperature contribution is none linear. Puzzle me this, if we were are 280PPM pre industry and we raised to 380PPM post industry for over 200 years plus all the prior years of fuel burning for heating and the PPM designated "" the point of no return "" or "" the point of collapse "" is 420PPM? or was it 460ppm? Then how did the Cambrian start at 6000PPm and how did life sequester so much hydrocarbon bio mass in low surface, sub surface and sub ocean deposits, how did sea life fossils end up on what are now in land meadows? 

According to the current modelling, the earth has already ended 4 times since the climate scare was started back in the 60s. Oil has also run out twice since the start of the climate scare, so. Either. This is all a lie because it creates expedient political control, or, we are actually all already dead, or, climate change is just a complete tax scam.

Co2 can't contribute as much temperature as is proposed as it has a saturation point where it's re radiative effect falls off, we are already at that point. Oil is likely to never run out either as in 200 years we have used just a fraction of the original sequestered co2 combination of hydrocarbon. The time it would take us to use it all up, new deposits accessible by technology like fracking, would already be forming, especially if we increase the earth's capacity for green growth through the introduction of more Co2.

If you look at the fear induced by "" climate change "" you'll notice that it's primarily aimed at western countries, countries like china do not have to participate in the paris accord but get all the green tech patents to sell back to the countries that invented them. You'll also notice that the main focus is Co2 which is the almost universal by-product of energy consumption and production. One intergovernmental organisation sets the policies that these western countries must abide by, In conclusion this means,  one organisation governs more than half of the world.

Scoff if you will but it's true, whether Co2 is heating the planet (which means the planet would have been a fireball during the Cambrian period ) or whether Co2 is a net benefit to the greening of the planet (which it is) neither outcome matters because the UN-IPCC governs almost all western countries now by throttling or allowing their production and consumption of energy and it governs those people by controlling their autonomy over personal transportation and soon, food as well.

Scoff some more if you like but I predict that over the next few decades, we're going to see a sharp drop in temperature due to the solar cycles and our orbital cycles combining to produce some harsh winters and mild summers. This entirely natural cycle will then be credited to the IPCC and climate activists, the green bubble will collapse as people demand their liberty and choice back, you'll all realise you were lied to and find something else to latch onto and we'll tax the crap out of that instead."

You mentioned other sources of engery before going nuts on them we also have create end off use for them. Take solar panels as they fail or become useless we have yet to come up with a way to fully recycle them that’s in the planets best interest. As of now we have warehouses full of used panels waiting to be recycled. The same is true about wind farms these towers alone weight hundreds of tons in steel not to mention thousands of tons of concrete to support them then try to recycle the blades. Yes we have problem only if we do not balance the books as to population, or figure out what the numbers would be if they where adjusted for population. In my world travels I have seen what the other countries use and there way of making vehicles that should not be running run burning oil and so much smoke and noise,over loaded . Our present answer is to build 650,000.00 dollar fire trucks with 30,000.00 dollar exhaust systems that in some cases go into regen driving to a fire call needing to have a other truck also answer the call.

"Alan Robertson","2021-02-19T18:24:09Z","@Nor Adrenalin - Thanks for the links. I had not realised that there was some more recent 2021 information. From your 3rd ref I got Table 6.1 (https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-6/ ) which was similar in format to the AR5 Table 12.1 I mentioned however importantly there were some high and medium confidence effects which are more likely. Where did the cost benefits numbers you quote come from? Your 4th reference (https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2964) asks for money, was it from there? When I first studied this subject I went to IPCC but as its difficult to digest I thought I could get the gist of it by looking at for and against videos on youtube. That was a blind alley because anyone can produce a convincing argument when there is no opposition, so you just end up picking the side that most appeals to you. For the actual climate science use IPCC. Its hard work. Beyond that there are political aspects where people can have preferences. I think I have to read some of the references. I can't give you a decent reply currently."
"Nor Adrenalin","2021-02-19T13:30:28Z","​@Alan Robertson Alrighty let's see what we got here.

_Reason for use of the word ""warmer"" is that there are sites that believe in the hypothesis and as you say ""deniers"" who do not_
I don't think we even need a word for ""people who accept the science of climate change"" for much the same reasons we don't need a word for ""people who accept the theory of gravity"". The science of anthropogenic climate change has long been past the the status of hypothesis and has been since the 1960s. In fact the firsts attempts to limit CO2 emissions were made in the 1960s by then-president Lyndon B. Johnson. This is not some new hypothesis that's still in it's infancy.

_CO2 lag is interesting is that it shows that in the past CO2 was not the initiator_
Not for the Younger Dryas, no. That was most likely caused by a combination of less solar radiation received in conjunction with a vast volcanic eruption in what today is Germany. But as I said before: No climate scientist ever claimed that greenhouse gases were the only factor that can influence our climate. And that is exactly why...

_ you have to make a more complex model to incorporate other things_
... scientist *do* include ""other things"" in their models. Changes in solar activity, the earth's albedo, volcanic actvity, land use, weather pattern etc. etc. are all accounted for in climate models and models of human influence on the climate. I mean c'mon: Do you really think the people who dedicated their life to understanding and analysis earth's climate wouldn't know about facts you can literally read off wikipedia?

_I can only direct you to the actual IPCC text relating to this matter, See Table 12.4, page 1115, dealing with abrupt and irreversible changes_
I know that the IPCC releases their reports to the public. I hadn't read this one though, because it's from 2013. The more recent ones can be found here : https://www.ipcc.ch/library/ and here https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/ (not that I'd claim to have read them all, obviously). 
Regardless of this I read the one you linked. But I also actually read the text surrounding the table the specifically referred to, that says e.g. ""most aspects of the climate
change resulting from CO2 emissions are irreversible, due to the long residence time of the CO2 perturbation in the atmosphere and the resulting warming"". I assume when referring to the table as an argument for your claim that tipping points aren't a thing or at least nothing to really worry about (is that the point you're making?) you're talking about the 3rd column ""Reversible"". Apart from the fact that it says for most reversible on a time scale of centuries to millennia (i.e. not reversible within a human life-span), the table reads ""Reversible *if forcing reversed* "". 
Now what does mean? Climate forcing - to put it simple - is the induction of energy into the climate system via various factors. A reversed forcing would be a scenario in which the total energy in the climate system actually shrinks (e.g. via a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration). The presence of such a scenario is the assumption under which this table operates. To go back to our forest fire analogy for a moment: The table doesn't deal with the question: _Will the fire continue to spread if we stop dumping fuel into the fire? _ but rather: _Can we regrow the forest after the fire was ended? _ ... In words: The table doesn't deal with tipping points. If you want to read an IPCC report that does deal with tipping points; this should be the most recent one: https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-6/ or if you want to ""drink from the source"" even more directly; this is one of the papers the report cites: https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2964

_people need to be able to perform cost benefit calculations to know what is worth doing. To do these calculations we need not only that X causes Y but how much X causes Y, probabilities and are there other relevant factors which we have ignored_
Scientists *do* these calculations. The very paper I just linked you does for example (which is obviously the reason I specifically picked it). It gives calculations for the annual social costs of 1 ton of CO2 for the future under different scenarios giving - of course - probabilities and confidence intervals for the values they arrive at. It's rather short and not too hard to read so I'd recommend you give it read, but if you just want a quick number. Under a baseline scenario (i.e. with only limited efforts to decarbonize) the social costs of of 1t of CO2 could reasonably as high as $450/t by 2060 and $750/t by 2100. For the US, at current emission rates, that would be an *annual* cost of roughly 2.3 trillion US$ (3.8 trillion US$ by 2100).  And that is not even factoring in indirect and non-climate change related social costs of fossil fuel use like an increased chance of getting lung cancer.

The gist is basically: Decarbonizing has a high upfront cost, but if you look past the next couple decades the cost of decarbonization are negligible in comparison to the costs of not mitigation climate change."
"Alan Robertson","2021-02-17T17:33:59Z","@Nor Adrenalin - Re Warmer. A) I accept that the warmer hypothesis best fits the available information and there is no better explanation. I am not a denier. Reason for use of the word ""warmer"" is that there are sites that believe in the hypothesis and as you say ""deniers"" who do not. If I wish to persuade you then it is better to pick a site on the warmer side of the argument. The New Scientist fits this bill. The reason the historical temperature - CO2 lag is interesting is that it shows that in the past CO2 was not the initiator, other things were. Which means you have to make a more complex model to incorporate other things. However its still possible that manmade CO2 can in this instance act as an initiator. I do not dispute that possibility. I agree with your forest fire analogy. I also agree there is no conspiracy. This lag is very well reported by both sides of the debate.
B) I only start disagreeing with you from ""We are steering towards a situation that is completely outside of our control..... etc. 
There are many websites which do speak of tipping points etc so easy to believe that if you want to. I can only direct you to the actual IPCC text relating to this matter, See Table 12.4, page 1115, dealing with abrupt and irreversible changes.
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL.pdf
As you probably know all IPCC texts are available.
C) ""Now you just need to put them together"". Just? That actually is the main point, we need a model which is sufficiently developed to be useful. The main purpose of this debate is what to do about it. Decarbonising the energy system, transport, food supply etc is very expensive. So are the projected costs of doing nothing. So people need to be able to perform cost benefit calculations to know what is worth doing. To do these calculations we need not only that X causes Y but how much X causes Y, probabilities and are there other relevant factors which we have ignored. (Which is where the CO2 - temp lag issue comes in)."
"Nor Adrenalin","2021-02-17T12:32:03Z","@Alan Robertson What is a ""warmer"" supposed to be? I thought the breed of climate change denial that flat out denies the earth is warming effectively died out a couple years ago and has been replaced by the narrative ""the earth is warming but it has nothing to do with human activity"".
The source you linked does not support your statement. And I'm not just talking about the fact that the article comes to the opposite conclusion you come to. But it only talks about the warming following he Dryas Ice Ages. Your statement was that CO2 increase _generally_ lacks behind a rise in temperature. You see, if I say that lightning strikes cause forest fires and you link me an article about a thunderstorm that happened after a forest fire, than that doesn't show the lightning doesn't cause forest fires. The mechanism lightning --> fire still works. (Btw. the same were true if you pointed to a forest fire caused by something different. Nobody ever claimed that the concentration of greenhouse was the only thing that can influence our climate). And that dipoles like CO2 trap infra-red radiation has been shown over and over again. 
And the fact that rising temperature can consequently increase the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere even more is not some well hidden secret that evil climate scientists don't want you to know about - or what some people believe believe. It's a key factor of why the global warming is such a big problem. More CO2 --> higher temperatures --> even more CO2 (and water vapor which is also a green house gas btw) --> even higher temperatures --> yet even more CO2 and so forth. You see the problem? We are steering towards a situation that is completely outside of our control. That is the ""runaway climate change"" that everybody is talking about (not to be confused with ""runaway greenhouse effect"" btw, that is something different). 
I think you already have all the pieces already to see why climate change is such a big deal. Now you just need to put them together."
"Alan Robertson","2021-02-16T00:01:26Z","- To be honest the lag references are no problem. I could give you 10 but more interestingly even the 'warmers' agree with it. Nobody disputes this on either side. Chose the Newscientist reference because they are not on the sceptics side so you can agree with it.

Yes I understand chemistry and how it could be a cause for the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Its possible but not the only possible explanation. I have no information to prefer one explanation over another. To quote from the reference already given in previous comment.
""One possible cause is the bolide impact event. Evidence that the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction was caused by an impact event has led many to believe that a similar impact may have led to other extinction events including the Permian extinction. Other possible causes of P-Tr extinction include volcanism, temperature crisis, especially in shallow marine waters, alteration of the carbon cycle, increased population of methane-producing microbes, widespread anoxia, and emission of hydrogen sulphide. Other scientists also suspect that the mass extinction may have been caused by the assembly of supercontinent Pangea."""

Climate might behave as a stochastic process. Especially if you look at short time intervals. It is however not random.

Next to that, you say that coral is dying, but way back in the past we had co2 levels much larger than now and it was actually the biggest explosion of life and ecosystems thrived because of it. I highly doubt co2 levels would cause corals to die."
"peter jones","2021-05-25T22:33:34Z","@SayHallo There is an old saying ""When you are in a hole stop digging""
The current short term warming is so far,  cooler than the peaks of the last 8000 years, ocean levels are LOWER than they were 6000 years ago (there was a large drop in ocean levels around 4500 years ago, and STILL have not risen back to that level).
Coral reefs are therefore GROWING higher as ocean levels slowly rise back toward their previous levels the exposed ancient reefs are now (and will be for some time ) DRY LAND.
Most coral bleaching is the result of exposure to air for too long rather than as a result of higher temperatures, there are many species of symbiotic  zooxanthellae  some handle cooler temperatures others warmer, coral polyps expel  zooxanthellae when the zooxanthellae, are in water temperatures higher than they can handle, but usually re capture species from the water column in time, a bleached coral is not necessarily dead, thats why the same species of coral on the Great Barrier Reef that temperature bleaches, lives quite happily in much hotter water further north without bleaching.
Storms are major causes of temporary  coral reef damage but the reefs re grow The Great Barrier Reef is in good shape and generally healthy.
There is based on ice core studies (there are uncertainties as to how accurate those Co2 measurements are due to pressure effects and the transfer of dissolved gases through ice by water flow, in any case they do not represent spot levels but averages over varying periods of time)  no overall paleoclimate correlation between rising Co2 levels and warming, the REVERSE IS TRUE, temperatures usually rise first THIS DRIVES UP Co2 with around an 800 year lag, but higher Co2 levels DO NOT STOP temperatures dropping which results in lowering of Co2 levels as colder oceans can hold MORE Co2 in solution, conversly WARMING oceans cannot hold as much Co2 in solution and outgass more into the atmosphere.
We do have fossil leaf stomata evidence from the Holocene thermal optimum of atmospheric Co2 levels of around 500 ppm, this is likely to be more accurate than ice core measurements.
There is overall only around a 15% correlation between rising Co2 levels and warming.
This is why researching the paleoclimate is important it allows you to put things into an accurate context.
Co2 may or may not produce atmospheric warming, this is yet to be settled, the limited experimental data we have says NO but this needs multiple replication.
If Co2 does provide warming to the atmosphere its effect will be strictly limited, this is because the effect will be logarithmic not linear, if Co2 warms its greatest warming effect will be at 20 ppm, with each subsequent doubling of Co2 in the atmosphere the additional warming produced will be smaller and smaller, assuming Co2 does warm, currently Co2 has used around 87% of its ability to warm, at 410 ppm we could double the concentration of Co2 without producing more than a small additional warming.
This is why the AGW hypothesis was ALWAYS mostly about water vapor,
Co2 is publicly attacked  for two reasons , who is going to panic about more clouds, and attacking Co2 allows them to attack our economy and start the process of removing cheap and abundant energy from the western nations which is the whole purpose of the exercise, thats why nuclear power which is the perfect solution if Co2 were a problem is being closed down  in western nations.
The north west passage was also open in the late 1930's looking at the Greenland glaciers they are still larger than they were a thousand years ago, they grow and shrink during periods of warming and cooling.
Greenland is called Greenland because it was very warm during the Medieval warm period, warmer than now in fact."

"Jeff Harmed","2021-01-13T10:20:19Z","Sir David Attenborough has said that reforesting our lands and feeding our populations with better food using modern technology is the best solution for ourselves and our planet. 

https://youtu.be/c3bdUk4qa0Y

Many people have believed the carbon dioxide demon when the truth is quite evidently right in front of their eyes. The stripping of forests for plantations and habitats has changed the climate. 

The planet’s climate has been controlled by life forms for 3 billion years as seen by earths carbon dioxide level of a mere 0.04% against our two neighbours mars and Venus that have 90%+ carbon dioxide. The burgeoning human population struggled to feed its own with grains that caused forests that bound soils and moisture to be ripped up and replaced with dry fields with no topsoil retention. So plant life’s grip on the climate was weakened and the climate shifted slightly. 

The solution is to return the forests and feed the population at the same time. New plant factories in the Netherlands (53°N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.

Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests

Don’t be misanthropic. Be positive. Be useful. Help flora and fauna control climate and don’t demonise plant food (carbon dioxide).

It’s now possible with plant factories to make a country like Britain self-sufficient in food and return its arable land to forests. It just requires the focus of resources.

The individual can also help reducing the rape of forests by moving away from grains into plant and animal fats and proteins with the keto diet and live longer and healthier lives."

Of course people would be smart enough during these days that apparent mechanisms of indoctrination and borderline slavery becomes crystal clear and feared as oppression since we dont ever feel satisfied or content with other aspects of life. Slavery not because you dont get paid, but because you're allowed little time of your life to be yours, otherwise population explosion. Christianity understands that the main point of life is family life. Materialism takes trunk space not even the backseat. Otherwise ""end of days"" rears its ugly face again. Respect what took countless generations of filtering out the stupid out of people until we supposedly are the smart ones in control by respecting the awe inspiring work of the super natural. understand, the bible warns about the inevitable trend of human ingenuity and the rise and persecution of the main loving individual with knowledge and reason and refreshing common sense that calls for humanity instead of blindly ignoring their humanity for new experiences that aren't necessarily self sustaining. Accept that the bible speaks of trends my friends, and Jesus will always be the one lovingly reminding us about our love towards life. No need to paralyze your own heart and your own access to truth through common sense awareness! My god people wake up from your mental slumber. The bible is about inevitable trends the kind we ought to be more careful about moving forwards. We should grown foods locally by repurposing plastic for hydroponic pods that can be attached to all vertical poles using metal straps. Four pods per row each row can be as little as 6 inches apart if you distance it horizontally as well as vertical, a little, as you move up to avoid it being directly above lower hydroponic pod. We can definitely and MUST definitely take control of food production. It can be a new kind of soicialized job/value instilling effort in the community. We may have tech evolving but our bodies still need proper nutrition in order to think and feel great. 

For energy we can use mountain sides by building rail track that goes top to bottom. Have water pipes at top. Fill train cart with as much water as possible. Utilize a slope to assist in cart acceleration down a tall mountain. The brakes can generate emissions-free electricity while pulling up another cart from the bottom to the top, but empty.... Hopefully... I mean if windmills can be a thing then so can using gravity as a source of energy. Hopefully this should free us to repurpose trash into bricks that we can use to house the homeless using gravity generated energy.

These options may be sub-optimal to the educated engineer, i understand that i just want to point out that we HAVE OPTIONS!!!! all we need is real unity!"

However Anthropogenic global warming is a hoax. 
Anthropogenic climate change is complete nonsense. 

Carbon dioxide is trace levels in your atmosphere at 400 ppm. 
Furthermore, it only holds heat for a few seconds. Therefore CO2 is not the thermostat that controls our climate on this planet. Carbon dioxide is completely ineffective at driving Climate. 

History even records climate change... we all have seen climate change from 
the three major Ice-ages recorded in history to the subsequent warming 
periods (which were the Medieval warming period in the Roman warming period). 

However, Anthropogenic global warming is a complete hoax. CO2 
has nothing to do with creating global warming. CO2 Is currently 400 ppm. 
That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. 
Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm which is 4% of the total CO2 produced in a year. 

CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds and there is not enough to drive climate- it is thermodynamically impossible and yet we are told it is true. Lastly, CO2will increase only after temperatures rise and conversely CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack there of and therefore does not drive climate but follow climate.  #CLIMATECHANGE

Carbon dioxide is good for life, it is not a pollutant, and it is not particularly important for the climate. There is a big problem  not addressed  here: real pollutants, like SO2. 
We can give up oil and coal, but with great human suffering, because we do not know how to produce enough energy (for now). Can (real) pollution be reduced? Of course, there are very effective filters. Why don't we use filters? Well, someone would have to pay for the installation of filters."

During the triassic era/period the co2 levels were at 2,000 ppm.. plant, animal life flourished..
So why does this seem to be so scary.. 
#1.. mutations are how we came into being.. and unless we go from 405ppm to 2,000ppm in 400 years then we will change as the earth does..
#2. How will temperatures rise when sea levels rise? The water absorbs 90% of the earths heat.. therefore more water more heat absorption..
#3. Plants live off co2, and high temperatures.. and once again in the triassic era, plant life was not only abundant but thriving.. therefore how will we lose plant life?
#4. The planet literally before humans ever were around, had astronomically high co2 levels as well as temperatures, and yet animal and plant life not only survived.. but continued to step forward..
So once again please explain how, why and what we did to cause this, and how it will affect us.. especially when you consider the extremely slow creep we are seeing, yet the earth/plants and animals survived far faster jumps in climate change previously.. and they had no technology or knowledge of it even happening.. yet the just used the slow process of mutations to continue to trudge through.. worst case we evolve to fit our climate needs.."

What? Of course Energy companies have a say in what gets mined. Do you think when a Energy company orders 10t of Thorium from a mine, the Mining company goes like ""Uh uh uuuh! Imma send y'all coal instead."" :D Many energy companies also mine resources themselves. 

"" _Thorium already has the groundwork for function_ ""

"" _The only reason they aren't being used is because its cheap and plentiful_ ""

You see how these two statements are not the same? 
The ""fleshing out"" as you call it will probably take some 10 to 30 years. That is unfortunately too late to use them as a primary mean of decarbonization. 
And yes fusion has several advantages over Thorium chiefly that a) the process produces more energy and b) we have a virtually limitless supply of the fuel they ""burn"" (i.e. Hydrogen)"
"Saucine","2021-02-09T16:32:45Z","@Nor Adrenalin Well as far as the first part goes, I don't think energy companies would like to buy coal either, but they don't have a say in what gets mined or do they? As far as I know there are no energy companies with thorium reactors, and it's true they're not just waiting to be built. But there are coalitions and research that is pushing *for the development of* thorium reactors. Fusion is in that stage of development and it's extremely hard from what I've heard. Thorium already has the groundwork for function, all that needs to be done is to fully flesh it out. My question is, if fusion is a lot harder, why build, test, and improve fusion? Does fusion have some long term advantage over thorium? When you compare the two, thorium makes more sense. At least that's how I see it."
"Nor Adrenalin","2021-02-09T07:58:08Z","@Saucine Let me turn this question around: Why would an energy company want to endlessly buy or mine for coal (and endlessly pay money) if they could just get so much energy from 1kg of thorium? Energy companies sell energy. They don't sell coal. The cheaper they can produce the energy the better for them. The reason why thorium rectors aren't being used is because there are no working thorium rectors. 
I'm not saying the concept wasn't sound. But as somebody working in research and development I can tell you that there is a world between having _a sound concept_ or even _a working prototype_ and having a functional end product. And people who pretend that thorium reactors are basically just waiting to be built are doing so either a) because they don't know any better or b) because they are being willfully dishonest."
"Saucine","2021-02-09T00:29:43Z","@Nor Adrenalin You're not wrong and you have a point. However, while you can mine endlessly (and endlessly get money) for coal and produce about 8kWh of energy per kilogram, one kilo of thorium could produce about 4.8 billion kWh of energy. Why sell 1 ton of thorium  when you could sell 600,000,000 tons of coal to make the same amount of energy?"

"Cleasia","2021-06-12T14:51:52Z","@Ian of Liverpool Hey, I'm just gonna reply in the two (well three now) comments I see you copy-pasting this. Sure most CO2 emission come from natural cause, and that human's miniscule input may seem insignificant.

But, remember that the natural CO2 back then were a part of a naturally balanced system/cycle. That, before human slowly increased and affect the CO2 emissions, earth had a fragile cycle to heat and _cool_ itself down.

But now that we added more CO2 into the atmosphere, that cycle is not interrupted and the earth is indeed getting hotter at an unnatural rate. You could even say it spiked, not just increase, but _spiking_.

You could see how the graph (and CO2 emission from human causes, let the graph to spike) from these video.

A calmer, clinical, and skeptical look on climate change: https://youtu.be/uqwvf6R1_QY

A more humorous, snappy, though showed how the CO2 emission affected the atmosphere more clearly imo in this video: https://youtu.be/R7FAAfK78_M

Take your pick.

Not to mention that even if Volcanoes or what have you erupted, it _also_ releases a cooling gas (I believe it was sulphur but I could be wrong) that counters the affect of its heat while humans _doesn't_ do that. And, if we continue to let the CO2 increase, and decrease natural land (trees or what have you) to make for more housing and fuel burning without stop— that natural cycle isn't going to keep up. Leading to the greenhousing CO2 from us (and natural causes) from the years before to stack up and make the earth even warmer, which leads to more residual CO2 next year, that'll make the earth even more next year, and so on and so forth.

So, small as it may, it does tip a delicate balance for humanity and is one of the cause, the main cause, for global warming.

I hope this helps ^^."

1. Probably because he's a puppet to corporate interests, and he'll be dead by the time sea levels get that bad. 
2. They're melting actually. https://phys.org/news/2019-06-himalayan-glaciers-years.html
3. Sea level rises are projections of the next half century. People aren't going to uproot their lives until they absolutely have to. 
4. We haven't seen a great increase in these events yet, that's true. If the earth were to warm to two or three degrees though, all models do show much greater increases. 
5. A good point, but how would she actually convince them to do anything anyways? 
6. Who is claiming this? What climate scientists have said this? Of course the media can be biased and get things wrong. I haven't heard of anyone claiming that though. 
7. They have a sea wall actually. Look it up! It's really interesting.
8. Once again, the sea level rises are what they want to avoid as much as possible in the next decades. They aren't going to suddenly drown California. 
9. Average global temperature increases can cause local temperature decreases in some cases, due to interruption of global sea currents. Even if they didn't, there would still be snow in many places, unless the earth warmed by a ridiculous amount. 
10. That's not scientific evidence. There is still ice, but it's not as thick in the winter as it once was, and it's even thinner in the summer. In some areas where it was once frozen all year round, the permafrost is beginning to melt in the summer. It's a reduction, not elimination. 
11. It isn't happening immediately. It couldn't. It's going to be gradual, and slower than ideal actually, because the rich make less money by cutting it off immediately. Oil companies have power in the political system, Republican and democrat. Even the Paris agreement isn't enough to actually stop two degrees of warming by the looks of things. 
12. Because he's a hypocrite, sure. The fact is that he's just one person. Companies are doing far far more than most individual people. 
13. I'm sorry. I don't really know what you mean by this one. 

Don't just trust me, do your own research! I would compile some resources here, but most of these can be googled. Thank you"

Northeast. Heat waves, heavy downpours and sea level rise pose growing challenges to many aspects of life in the Northeast. Infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised. Many states and cities are beginning to incorporate climate change into their planning.

Northwest. Changes in the timing of streamflow reduce water supplies for competing demands. Sea level rise, erosion, inundation, risks to infrastructure and increasing ocean acidity pose major threats. Increasing wildfire, insect outbreaks and tree diseases are causing widespread tree die-off.

Southeast. Sea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to the region’s economy and environment. Extreme heat will affect health, energy, agriculture and more. Decreased water availability will have economic and environmental impacts.

Midwest. Extreme heat, heavy downpours and flooding will affect infrastructure, health, agriculture, forestry, transportation, air and water quality, and more. Climate change will also exacerbate a range of risks to the Great Lakes.

Southwest. Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all linked to climate change, have increased wildfires. Declining water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to heat, and flooding and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns."

Not to mention that the computer power today is too small to manage the system of equations properly. So, incomplete set of equations, nonlinearity (huge approximations), parameters that are not the result of measurements (like climate sensitivity), but estimations...

all in all, I think we are pretty close in our research and views.. Which means, you actually read and research and dont just read headlines.. So I already like you. I still dont get how too much Co2 would hurt plants, but I will have to research, whether some plants are like us in to high oxygen levels will straight kill them, or is their range far larger than ours or not... maybe they have a smaller Goldielocks zone then we do.. But even say that is true, think of slash and burn farming... The forest literally grows back even thicker.. I would imagine this would be the case if the Co2 levels increased.. for plant life at least, maybe not.. But common sense points that way..
But Honestly I know everyone is worried about temp rise.. But our true biggest treat is temp drop.. Most of us wouldn't survive an Ice age.. I do appreciate the comment without any venom.. Thanks bubba.."

Those who agree.. DO SOMETHING FOR ENVIRONMENT! 

● Stop using those plastic bags! U can carry a heavier mobile all time then u can carry a 5 g cloth bag too when going out eah time. Keep the pre existing plastic bags which u already have in your cars, scooty so that whenever u go out u can use them. 

● Store that RO waste water and use to wash clothes or water plants,  or fill in the washing machine or even mop the floor,  For 1 litre of drinking water, 3 litres of waste watsr is produced. Those who are buikding new houses should connect the ro waste water to the toilets.

●   Its high time we start recycling plastics friends!

● and the most often heard... plant a tree. Most of u cant due to lack of space or u r too busy to help save planet. 
U can at least donate to the organisations! A small amount of 100 rs. Also makes a difference!

● Put indoor plants in house instead of air purifiers if ur air is not that polluted. U can put snake plants which are approved by NASA and they dont beed fertislisers, and water is only needed once a month at maximum. They are a little expensive, but thats a one time investment!
There are several other plants also which are of no maintenance.

● Dont think that caring for environment is uncool or who cares and stuff. This generation may die happily, but the coming generation will starve to death! 

● EVERY EFFORT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. Every drop of water saved adds a day to someone's life. Every tree planted adds to someone's breathe! 



PLS MAKE A DIFFERENCE..... WE NEED TO SAVE THIS PLANET!

Because it is not a government agency, and because its members are not predisposed to believe climate change is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, NIPCC is able to offer an independent unbias expert opinion of the evidence reviewed – or not reviewed – by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the issue of global warming.

NIPCC seeks to objectively analyze and interpret data and facts without conforming to any specific agenda. This organizational structure and purpose stand in contrast to those of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is government-sponsored, politically motivated, and predisposed to believing that climate change is a problem in need of a U.N. solution.

 • The NIPCC has been proving over and over for decades that Co2 does not cause climate change and that the Temperatures are not only normal and the same as they were 1,000 years ago, but they have VALID PROOF THAT THE HEATING OF EARTH IS ACTUALLY GOOD .

I get that you like sarcasm but please, you claim to be a science channel but you cannot even talk without 'attacking' (for lack of a better word) the opposing argument. Full disclosure: I am not a climate change skeptic, I just care about the way information is presented. Instead of using the ad hominem fallacy over and over, how about trying to neutrally report your position with evidence to support. 

Example from the video: ""the debate on climate change has been long, complex and intense. This is of course not true because according to their own science..."" (I don't really feel like typing the whole thing out so from 4:18-4:33)

That statement is factually accurate because climate scientists have been trying to figure out all of the effects of climate change for several years now (and we are still trying to figure out the effects). It's a fricking world climate with so many countries, companies, variables, etc. Climate scientists are still not 100% certain of what will happen. That's why, if you read the IPCC's most recent report (the staying under 1.5 C), you can see that there is a TON of things they have to talk about, and within each one, they list off the things they are 'confident' in and how much evidence supports it. According to their charts, they have varying levels of confidence (from low confidence to high confidence). Medium confidence is about 50% certainty an outcome will occur which doing a simple Ctrl-F will reveal dozens of times ""medium confidence"" appears in their report. Meaning that there is uncertainty about certain outcomes. Which means that it's debated.

SO. TLDR; Climate change is an ongoing debate, and it has been long, it has been complex, and one could classify as intense if they wanted to. However, the existence of climate change is real, and the statement made by that ad was accurate thus invalidating one of AsapSCIENCE's argument points. 

My opinion: This guy talking is too passionate and needs to report information in an unbiased manner; his emotions on the topic cloud his judgment to make reasonable points of opposition."

The revelation that global warming is a religion based loosely on science is hardly front page news.  What is less well known is that the same can be said for aspects of meteorology, specifically the convection model of storm theory.
My name is James McGinn. I am an atmospheric physicist and a science theorist laying the ground work for a brave new future of severe weather mitigation. I have an exciting new hypothesis on the cause of storms.  Click the link below to see what all the excitement is about.

"Greg Byrne","2020-11-10T05:29:08Z","Energy is neither created nor destroyed.
On this planet.
All energy comes from Goes to the SUN.

Earth is a 4.5 Billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with life.

Climate change is has and will always be caused by the Milankovitch cycles.
The changes in the Tilt of the earths Axis, North star and proximity to the SUN.

Obliquity is causing Global warming. As the axis of he earth continues to tilt towards the sun. More direct sunlight reaches the higher latitudes. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink Oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen CO2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and CO2 follows. Cause and effect. Not this BS forcing putting the cart before the horse.

The inconvenient truth about the Milankovitch cycles causing climate change is that every 13 thousand years at the Vernal Equinoxes the equator eclipses the orbital plane and the gravitational pull of he SUN pulls global Tsunami's around our water planet east to west because the planet is spinning west to east.

Gobekli Tepe was filled at the last Equinox 12 thousand years ago. The Mayan Calendar predicts this Now give or take 72 years in the great year.

Eccentricity is the trigger at the perihelion.

So yes climate change is happening but no co2 is not causing it. It is all a distraction to raise money to build space ships to get off the planet while fossil fools like you and your useful idiot cohorts run around like chickens with your heads cut off.

Want to save humanity? Prepare for the Global Tsunami's that are inevitable. Not if But when. By building a railroad to Alaska, Preparing the top of Africa with water and trees for the long cold planetary winter. 

CO2+H2O+SUN=LIFE

Fossil fuels are nothing more than trapped energy from the sun.

Planets do what planets do. We tried before to stop these tsunami's with the Great wall of china to no avail.
Trump seems to be your best bet. 
Build that wall. That isn't a wall to stop people unless you consider dead corpses washing up against it to make a new oil field people.
He also is promoting planing 1 billion trees because it is going to get cold because once the  the tsunami's wash across the continents they will freeze into the continental glaciers \. What doesn't freeze will evaporate and block out the SUN for ?

The one of =f that has confused humanity is Noah's flood which was specific to the Mediterranean. It would have only broke the Strait of Gibraltar silt dam some 3-4 thousand years ago. And it would have taken 40 days and 40 nights for the Mediterranean to fill back up again.

Anyway Good Luck. I am not long left in this form of CO2=H2O+SUN I hope to come back as anything but a human to see the stupidity humans are getting on with."

I mean the atmosphere of Venus has huge amounts of CO2, and it acts as a smothering blanket, raising the surface temperature to about 900 degrees. its not just CO2 that act as heat sinks by the way, Methane is 60 percent better at trapping heat. and get this, water vapor is the strongest green house gas we know of. atmospheres, we believe, are delicate and can drastically. the science about atmospheres is fascinating. one of my heroes, the late Carl Sagan, did his dissertation on the planets of our solar system and their different atmospheres. mars without an atmosphere is naked to the radiation and frigid cold of space. we get just enough protection and heat from our own. but Venus.... Venus is a planet much like earth, but its atmosphere of mainly CO2 traps heat for a long time, and the heat, as ive mentioned, is ridiculous. 

look, its cool to argue against the popular opinion. Einstein did it with general relativity, and is known around the world as a genius today. but this will not be that battle my friend. the science vote is in. its been cast. for a long time now. we know how this shit works, its not some big confusing conspiracy. temperatures are rising, and CO2 is rising, maybe we should dump more CO2 into the atmosphere just top prove the point. but that point is being prove right now, and will be proven even more severely in the near future I promise you."

The last 100 years have been incredibly stable if you take the raw data from all 1218 american weather stations. There is actually dangerously low levels of CO2 in the atmosphere at the moment. If we have a huge increase in CO2 we do not get a warming effect, we actually get a cooling effect hence why we had 6 major ice ages and all had far more CO2 in the atmosphere than we do today. There is also far more at play than CO2 that affects temperature. We are polluting the soil through the use of herbicides and pesticides and this is where the real focus should be. In the early 20th century there were far more forest fires than there was today, the history books do not lie. The real conspiracy is that CO2 is being demonised when we actually need lots more of it. A ban on fossil fuels with result in the deaths of millions of people."
"Zachary Higginbotham","2020-11-14T03:18:13Z","Robbie Scrivener 3 more things.. 1). CO2 is necessary!! with out it we would surely freeze as a significant amount of the suns light would be lost to space. However, just like life, its a delecate balance; too little we freeze, to much we fry. 2). the regulation of CO2 in our atmosphere is controlled by our oceans (which turn CO2 into carbonic acid) and by, as we all know, photosynthesis. These two constants have in the past kept the PPM of CO2 in our atmosphere from tipping the scales. but our oceans are becoming saturated and acidifying, and our plant life is burning. Our biosphere is losing its natural regulators. so atmospheric CO2 is rising. because of this our planet is steadily warming. 3). There are several positive feed back mechanisms that our accelerating the warming of our planet. lets start with permafrost. permafrost is frozen plant matter stored in ice around our northern hemisphere. this plant matter has yet to decay, so its methane and CO2 are sealed like in a vault. the warming of our planet is causing these vaults to ""open"", or in reality “melt”. the contents of these vaults are enough to significantly increase the atmospheres ability to trap heat, and will itself accelerate the melting of more permafrost. this is the feed back loop that is occurring right now. the next feed back loop is the demisinishing of reflective surfices. Ice is the most reflective surface on our planet, and water is the most light absorbant. as the ice sheets melt, more of the surface of our globe will be able to absorb more energy (light or heat. all are synonymous). this will increase the temperature of the ocean and continue to melt more ice. this is the feed back loop that will, just as the previous loop, accelerate itself. the last feed back loop is the destruction of forests. whether by man or by fire, our forests are disappearing. because of the rise in heat wave, forest fires are burning more often, with more intesity, over larger swaths of forested land. this year alone saw more forest fires than has ever recorded. our forests, as any child knows, converts CO2 into sugar and O2 as part of its respitory cycle we call photosynthesis. when these trees burn, they not only stop the gas conversion, but release their stored CO2 back into the atmosphere to further warm the planet, and increase the capacity of forest fires to burn. This is final feed back loop.

it's easy and sometimes empowering the believe and endorse conspiracies, but the truth in this instance is far more interesting. instead of a massive conspiracy to destroy the natural fuel industry, what we see is the ability of a single species to destabalize their own planet. over the next century if preventitive actions are not taken, our climate will be undeniably changed. you look young robbie, and thats great. you will see this take place in your life time. i ask you now if you wish to be the one people who people remember as denying the greatest calamity our species has ever endured, or as someone who saw the world as it was changing, and correctly prodicted its outcome. you strike me as someone who likes to be right. So i ask you consider what ive said, conduct your own research, and make your own model for our reality. and be judged by your peers accordingly."

The climate cycles of our water planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane at the ecliptic's.

Global warming is caused by the increase in tilt of the earths axis. Increasing the amount of DIRECT sunlight the higher latitudes poles receive. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect.

"john zuijdveld","2020-10-28T23:57:54Z","Rubbish! the first to theorize about the effects of us burning fossil fuels was a guy back in the mid 40s' Then sometime in Brittan's Thatcher yrs, she was alerted to the theory and the possibility that it might already be happening. She started an enquiry into it and after a few yrs it was decided that it was too big and that it needed to be studied by a bigger, more all encompassing entity and so the United Nations Panel on Climate Change was born. I think that was around 1980 and should be easy to find out exactly.(yes! I may be lazy, but I'm more interested in telling what I know than proving it, as I said it would be easy to verify) they put out a report every 4yrs. and it is the result of 4yrs of research by around 1200 of the worlds' most prominent climate and weather scientists, unfortunately it also has attached to it around 300 diplomates and others who continually push to have the report watered down so as to not destabilize Govts. In one of the reporting yrs. the scientists were SO outraged at the lack of clarity released that they actually put out a report of their own! So if you want to know how bad things are then consider that even the UNPCC report is minimalized. Things are changing faster than anyone predicted, we must act now and we DO have the technological means to slow it down, and in time even reverse it, but time is racing ahead!

It is always about what the US is going to do and never India or China, who have it the worst."
"Bonobo Norman","2020-10-28T09:14:30Z","There is NO CLIMATE EMERGENCY and atmospheric CO2 is actually too close to starvation-levels at current 400 ppm, so we could be living in a greener and lusher world if it could be boosted to 1,000 ppm again, as in past lush Interglacial periods. Humans are now recycling past plant-material transubstantiated into coal and oil which contribute very little to this huge global CO2 metabolism.
Green plant photosynthesis must have atmospheric CO2 to fabricate Carbohydrate sustenance and release O2 gas for us to breathe. Gaseous CO2 is for plants like life-giving breathable O2 gas is for us humans and animals. CO2 is NOT a poisonous weather pollutant and instead we depend on green plants and their productive use of CO2 for our survival!
FACT IS that we live at the tail end of a 10,000-year INTERGLACIAL CYCLE and in just another one or two thousand years we are likely to slowly enter a statistically inevitable ~90,000 yearlong ICE-AGE.

The seas in Northern Europe are draining due to the LAND-RISING because of the past pressure of a several kilometres thick ice-cap that  once weighted  the Northern land down. In other areas we see a relative SEA-RISING due to land dropping, especially at the edges of the grinding tectonic plates. Our planet is still ALIVE, and we can see this in beautiful geysers and destructive earthquakes and VOLCANIC eruptions. It is Earth as usual and perfectly normal!

That's right, our old Earth have had many such ICE / GREEN CYCLES with each averaging a total of about one hundred thousand years! So, we are extremely lucky to live at the optimum habitual time in current INTER-GLACIAL period, when obviously glaciers and polar caps melt and sea-level goes up. This climatic trend will reverse like a pendulum and the world will again grow massive icecaps that drains much of the seven seas all over again! Sadly, green plants and most living things will slowly perish over the next ice-age's many millenniums. Hopefully, the coming Ice-age will leave us a wide survival ""zero-season-zone"" around the equator for our future generations to escape to.

Earth's complicated and varied climate reflects so many factors like humidity, reflective cloud cover, Earth rotational tilt angle, the shape of the elliptical annual orbit around the sun and interplanetary and interstellar radiation. And most of all, what ""mood"" our great all mighty SUN happens to be in!
We ""bipeds"" are not as important as we like to think, and we definitely cannot ""operate"" and ""control"" Earth climate destiny by choosing a nuclear vs. wind electricity providers and driving a newly manufactured 1830 kg electric car instead of keeping the swift old WV Golf. Vegan of genuine human food makes for no change except for near-zone farting-frequency. Ignore slick advertising and enjoy your unique gift of life to the fullest and give the ""climate hysterics"" the ""finger"" because they are out to destroy your mental health for absolutely nothing in return. Trust me, we are so blessed to be alive in this time of history!

Finally, the real environmental problems are associated with foolish over-population, greedy over-consumption, over-fishing, rapidly shrinking animal habitats and species eradication. Pollution of seas and air must stop, especially from China and all the many rivers of Asia."

They also push the lies that we need more oxygen/plants when in fact more oxygen = less plants and more fires. Plants breath Carbon in any most gaseous forms, thus More CO2 = more plants. Everything these lunatics have been telling us is a reversed script. Now all you have to do is go to Wikipedia and research things as essential to the environment as peat and you'll find it vilified as if it's a detriment to the environment simply for producing access carbon (the building block of life). Plants thrive on the ""shit"" in the air just as much as they thrive on the shit on the ground. The global warming theory literally claims that the life cycle is bad and is destroying life on earth. If you reduce carbon you reduce life. It is argued that dinosaurs couldn't exist today because there are not enough plants due to depleted carbon in the atmosphere and an access of oxygen. And besides all that, green energy creates far more toxic pollutants for the environment during production. Many of these pollutants are dumped in the oceans and are far more difficult for nature to break down. The atmosphere is easier for the environment to clean, because trees are the worlds greatest purifiers but we are removing their ability to do anything by reverting our pollutants to chemicals and plastics in the name of green energy. It would actually be a beneficial thing for the environment if we burned all our trash at the power plants.

We had far higher CO2 levels in the distant past which still led to ice ages. The ice core records prove that CO2 levels lag behind temperature changes by hundreds of years. We are coming out of a mini ice age so it's normal for temperature records to have been broken. Temperature changes have been static since the late 90s and it is probable that it will be a lot colder as the solar minima takes hold. If not then it is estimated that the CO2 levels must double for each extra 1C of temperature increase. So we are a long way from the panic point instilled into our children at schools and colleges. It will be ironic if we actually need to release more CO2 in order to save us from an ice age in the next few years. If it was a real problem then the government would use molten salts instead of pressurised water to cool nuclear power plants. This won't enable them to work at far higher temperatures which could both make electricity 20% more efficiently and allow it to crack atmospheric CO2 and recombine it is with water to form synthetic automobile fuel. This would effectively make burning fuel carbon neutral. These power plants could also act as desalination plants as well. There is no need for new technology but I am sure we would all benefit from the release of the high technology used by the government in its black projects that power their ARVs and TR3Bs."
"Invincibletro","2020-10-17T06:18:37Z","7.8 billion people (and climbing) at a 98.6 degree average, heating their houses to 72 degrees when the average surface temperature is 59F. Everything we use that creates heat or friction. Obviously the temp has been climbing, but we would have to control population to effectively change the environment. Yes we can make changes in how much CO2 we produce, but the population increase will counter-act most of them. All countries should promote a 2 child or less household."

"Byron Allen","2020-10-17T00:49:58Z","total nonsense!!!   the real temperature change has been .14C per decade, basically virtually nothing!!!      In addition the CO2 impact is self limiting and we are at virtual saturation of CO2 absorption of energy.  It takes exponentially more CO2 for each 1/2 degree and this means that the entire warming theory is not an issue.  Then we have the fact that the CO2 increase is dramatically helping plant life.

The proof for CO2 from fossil fuels was established in 1955, from which Keeling gave us the Keeling Curve in 1960, proving that CO2 levels are increasing. By late 60s many scientists were arguing the dangers and many papers were written in the 70s. Exxon no doubt put a lid on its own research, and they had a whole team of lobbyists to fight the concept, producing tons of papers to counter valid claims, as did all oil companies, done through a consortium, as did big tobacco. Shell and all still hire environmental scientists, more for legal than environmental purposes, perhaps..."

What melted the last ice age?
What froze the last ice age?
Was not CO2,  it was the sun, orbit, volcanism, or comet or asteroid.
92% of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is simple water vapor.
Chemical energy got man into the Industrial Age.  Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment.."

Yes, scientists are all in agreement, but the 97% figure which is what I am assuming you are referring to is incorrect, it is more like 90% based on multiple studies.
The person who you are referring to is a highly controversial scientist that rejected research and repeatedly went against conduct, his points have been debunked numerous times.

The scientific census on the australian fires is not that they were caused directly by global warming, but rather global warming could have played a hand in the devastation. These effects will greatly accelerate in the near future, can't wait till you eat your words.
Temperatures were not higher in the 1800s or 1940s. I am assuming you aren't referring to global temperatures?
""Climategate"" was debunked a long time ago, about 11 years ago or so. Check factcheck.
And you have linked me to numerous climate denial blogs and a youtube video. Blogs which have been discredited numerous times in the past and debunked as well, and a 1 hour long movie. The movie itself disagrees with green energy and says that population is killing us. I can agree with that, nuclear or fusion is the way to go as well as controlling population and lowering our consumption. I am assuming that the point you are trying to make is that green energy is bad. Oh, and the movie you linked also contradicts your opinion on global warming."

Moreover  scientists like this one  https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-skeptic-professor-fired-for-telling-truth-great-barrier-reef/   are bullied into to not questioning and are forced to keep quite.
People have gone through the national archives here is Australia, the 2019 fires that were supposed to be the worst in History and caused by GW, were in fact 1/5 th  the size of fires we had in 1975 and marginally larger then those in the late 1800s and again in the 1930/40s.
And temperatures were higher in the late 1800s & 1940s too.

1. CO2 is good for plants, but not in this amount, why do you think we are planting trees and shit, the plant life that is here now can't keep up with our emissions.
2. Oxygen means fewer plants and more fires? Never heard that one before, how would that even work? Please explain
3. More CO2 doesn't mean more plants, does more oxygen mean more mammals? How have you come to this conclusion? I am sure there are a ton more factors that have a bigger effect on the amount of life than the amount of CO2.

5. You are repeating yourself about CO2 and amount of life, it doesn't make your point better

Just wait tell all our beautiful forests burn down because our fire prevention has intervened on a very important natural process. Then you will really experience a ecological back step.
Now for you, do you really think the little C02 we produced is solely responsible for climate change? Don't you think that there might be other more independent variables of nature that could also cause this. Look towards the sun."

"Ken Reckless","2020-10-19T07:20:43Z","@Auke Meijer UAH data (1979-2019) has observed temps increasing by 0.13C/decade. I guess I think of ""rapid"" as being faster than ~1.5C in 100 years. The idea that it is ""direct intervention by Humans"" doing it is similarly contestable. Even just the idea that it is CO2 alone - while CO2 has gone up pretty steadily, temps over the 20th century fluctuated. The 1930s were very warm, the 1970s saw cooling, the first 15-20 years of the 21st century saw relative stagnation. There are a lot of factors.
The idea that increased temps will cause disasters is just propaganda. There's no evidence to support it. Rates of drought, heatwaves and floods have not been increasing, and historically when temps have been warmer than today (eg Roman Warming Period, Medieval Warming Period) the times have been more prosperous and wealthy. Better harvests, less starvation, a healthier population and spare resources to go build cathedrals and so forth. Conversely, cooler periods see failed harvests, starvation and poverty. In broad terms, warm is good and cold is bad."
"Ken Reckless","2020-10-18T12:17:05Z","@Auke Meijer Yeah... about those gasses. CO2 has been dramatically higher in the past without triggering runaway warming.

"Old_Toucs","2020-10-17T12:49:12Z","The average temperature of the Earth's surface is 14.7C
However if you calculate it as (average T^4)^0.25 it is about a degree hotter
So 15C ain't far wrong either way.

However the theoretical temperature based on sunlight hitting the Earth is -19C. Right there is why the GH effect is usually stated as being 34C, its the difference between -19C and 15C.

However the surface (sea level) might not be the right place to calculate the theoretical temperature, if the right place is in the atmosphere the real GH effect is less than 34C. A tiny bit less, a lot less, could it even be zero? A good question but now you need new theories and a supercomputer."
"Auke Meijer","2020-10-18T11:51:19Z","No"
"Old_Toucs","2020-10-17T07:43:36Z","The GH effect was not discovered or proven in the 1800s. The experiment by Arrhenius showed that CO2  absorbed some radiation better than other gasses, it was then speculated that the atmosphere might be the cause of the 34C anomaly that came to be called the GH effect. What is rarely pointed out is that the entire 34C effect is a result of calculating the temperature balance at sea level. There is zero evidence that sea level is where the temperature balance should be. Convection and evaporation both drive the balance upwards and at about 5km up the GH effect is zero.
Though scientists have shown that temperature correlates with CO2 it isn't clear if it follows, leads or both are driven by something else. It may interest you that Earth has had much higher CO2 and much higher temperatures in the past, what we have now is actually unusually low for both."

I am a scientist and understand that you have been told political information we are going into an ice age.  The sun is going to sleep as it has done in the past.  The atmosphere lags about 5 years from the overall power from the sun (sun flares, CMEs , sun spots) CO2 can be a greenhouse gas in much higher concentrations however not with the chemistry of water.  The ice cores of the past prove this.  The amount of carbon sequestration proves this also. Does oil pollution bad yes, is it expensive, yes, chemical energy can never be more than 50% efficient, however it is not causing global warming.  The Sun is the driver of the weather. It is a fact look at the geological record."

"whipivy","2020-10-09T02:25:10Z","I'm still being lied to about climate change, all of these purported effects of climate change are not. Wildlife is being eaten into instinction.  Heatwaves and deaths also coincide with poverty (no AC) and energy restrictions and an incalculable number of other confounding factors. The effects of climate change are all confounded with lurking variables. We really don't know what the effects of climate change in an isolated and controlled environment is because we can't simulate it, though people have tried and they have also been caught tampering with models to produce results they wanted.

Even if climate change were real, which it could be, there is nothing that can be done to reverse it if it were in fact catastrophic, anything which contradicts this is simply superstitious or worse, another facet of vanity for people to use in order to embellish their social reputation as ""good"" and ""concerned"" people....and nothing more, that's all they really care about. Which is why they make videos about how concerned they are, read morally superior, and how intelligent they are, read intellectually superior, and just how great of a person they are. Nobody cares, not really, you're wasting your time out here, people want stuff and they're going to do whatever they think they need to do to get it. Even liberals who pretend they don't admire capitalism clad their ridiculously expensive cars in bumper stickers, wear their little rubber bracelets, don their eco friendly garb (which still requires energy to produce) and they rant and rave spreading their drivel on technology (which requires energy), everything they do requires materialism of some sort, it's like branding really. But that's what it takes to let everyone know that you're a great person because that's important somehow.

The biggest lie about climate change is that it has a purpose; something that vain and shallow people can use for self-aggrandizement. Which is why it seems more like a religion these days than a scientific theory. This  is why young people are eager to peddle this stuff, vanity is strong in youth."

As for greedy Exon, many countries in the world suffer high oil prices not from greedy Exon but from fuel excises imposed by greedy Governments, and many public service green groups rely on this government funding for there existence, as the problem is now well known and action is being taken, I say all these publicly funded green operations are not needed anymore, and we can all be saved some tax dollars, so yes, we are being lied to and yes, we are being pilfered, but its not Exon who is the worst offender."

IN Searching For A New Enemy To Unite Us, We Came Up With The Threat Of Global Warming” | Climatism
“IN Searching For A New Enemy To Unite Us, We Came Up With The Threat Of Global Warming”

“The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.“
– Club of Rome,
premier environmental think-tank,
consultants to the United Nations

“Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the
industrialized civilizations collapse?
Isn’t it our responsiblity to bring that about?”
– Maurice Strong,
founder of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP

But, remember that the natural CO2 back then were a part of a naturally balanced system/cycle. That, before human slowly increased and affect the CO2 emissions, earth had a fragile cycle to heat and _cool_ itself down.

But now that we added more CO2 into the atmosphere, that cycle is not interrupted and the earth is indeed getting hotter at an unnatural rate. You could even say it spiked, not just increase, but _spiking_.

You could see how the graph (and CO2 emission from human causes, let the graph to spike) from these video.

A calmer, clinical, and skeptical look on climate change: https://youtu.be/uqwvf6R1_QY

A more humorous, snappy, though showed how the CO2 emission affected the atmosphere more clearly imo in this video: https://youtu.be/R7FAAfK78_M

Take your pick.

Not to mention that even if Volcanoes or what have you erupted, it _also_ releases a cooling gas (I believe it was sulphur but I could be wrong) that counters the affect of its heat while humans _doesn't_ do that. And, if we continue to let the CO2 increase, and decrease natural land (trees or what have you) to make for more housing and fuel burning without stop— that natural cycle isn't going to keep up. Leading to the greenhousing CO2 from us (and natural causes) from the years before to stack up and make the earth even warmer, which leads to more residual CO2 next year, that'll make the earth even more next year, and so on and so forth.

So, small as it may, it does tip a delicate balance for humanity and is one of the cause, the main cause, for global warming.

I hope this helps ^^."

Hmmm...first off why would an oil company spend millions of dollars on something that could not help them and only hurt them? My answer to that is, they wouldn’t and show me your source. I am in my 60’s and I have seen leftists like you cry, “Ice Age coming!” Then it was “Global Warming is coming, We’re all going to die.” When that fizzled y’all regrouped and came up with “Climate Change” a catch all phrase for sure. Scientists from around the world for over 50 years have collected ice core samples from both poles, earth core samples from the earth all over the face of the Earth and have come up with a good idea of what the climate has been like for humans for the last few millennia minimum, and guess what? We are still here! Mankind has survived. There have been huge Ice Ages and little Ice Ages, the last “Little Ice Age” was in the early 1800’s, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age 
less than 300 years ago, well within written history. Again we survived. Real scientific studies have FAILED to link man or more specifically man’s influence on the environment to global warming. They DO NOT deny that the earth is warming! Let me repeat that in bold. CLIMATE SCIENTISTS DO NOT DENY THAT THE EARTH IS WARMING! Nor do they deny that climate changes. In fact the majority of CLIMATE scientists (NOT the general term scientists which you people include Bill Nye a man with only a masters degree in engineering) agree that climate on the planet is fluid and cyclical, but nobody has proven that we influenced this change nor that we can alter or reverse the current warming. 
You are a young person that has swallowed this “lie of the left” in all the glory of your naïveté. The purpose of the global warming scare is all about government control, something you know nothing about because in you indoctrination of your school years you never studied real government control like they have in China, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba...

Yes, a few rogue scientists at Exxon pub. a memo falling for the CO2 AGW fake physics hoax, but upper mgt. ignored it after their other scientists rejected it. Digging it up and framing upper mgt. on a top-level coverup for financial gain is moose hockey.  All along, CO2 physically can't melt an ice cube with its radiation emission wavelength of 15 microns, the same given off by dry ice at -80C. Cold can't heat anything, much less cause global warming. The rest is the real coverup by leftist environmentalists centered in the U.N. and its IPCC octopus for financial and political gain because they hate the fossil fuel industry and would push any hoax to make useful idiots who dismantle it for them. The global warming debate has never been closed by science, but by government orgs. controlled by the leftist-run U.N. to push their program of destroying capitalism to make way for global Marxism.

"La Verdad Buscador","2020-09-15T13:56:02Z","I'm right-wing, but I agree global warming is real. A lot of us believe it's real, but the debate is if it's ""man made"" or if this is ""natural"". That part I'm on the fence about just because there is quite a bit of data removed from the graphs. Basically, there is a reason the biggest salesman of global warming was Al Gore (not a scientist). However, car emissions still aren't good to breath in.....I mean, start a car in a garage and see how long you live.
I don't see solar panels, hydro, and wind as inferior or naive. I see them as an opportunity to self reliance from government. I want to make my own energy. My side of the fence even said (like you said in the video) that GW would add to new products and innovation.....that's literally what all these technologies are doing, plus the growing healthfood and hygiene market.

I'm personally more worried about war over the last few drops of oil than global warming.....for immediate reasons. But eitherway, I still think the best course of action is be adopting green alternatives. It's the politics aspect of it that needs to end for that to happen....on both sides."

The apocalypse! 40 years of those images is hard to remove from the mind of someone whos been putting gas in their tank all their life. The irony, of course, is that everything the petrochemical companies suggested would happen without oil will only happen, and far worse with the continuation of its use."
"Ralph Ellis","2020-09-04T14:35:09Z","There is still no empirical evidence that CO2 causes global warming  (correlation does not imply causation).   An increasing greenhouse effect depends upon increased re-radiation from CO2 in the atmosphere, and this manifests itself as a tropical tropospheric hotspot, plus increased Downwelling Longwave Radiation (DLR) which warms the surface.   However, this hostspot and increasing DLR has never been detected.  In which case, CO2 is not causing global warming.

And we know this because during the ice ages - when CO2 levels were high the world cooled, and when CO2 levels was low the world warmed.  The climate would not do that, if CO2 was the primary feedback agent.  In reality, the primary feedback agent is albedo (reflectivity), which explains all aspects of the ice age temperature cycle.  Please see my latest science paper on CO2, which demonstrates that during the ice ages CO2 was NOT controlling world temperature.

"La Verdad Buscador","2020-09-17T14:20:02Z","@KingintheMountain the list of published scientists have degrees bro.
I also used to believe in the man-made aspect about 10yrs ago. But after I realized that all the models they had didn't come true time and time again, it was time for me to actually look at the data myself. There isn't something right, if the models were right we'd be under water by now. Thats when I realized that the data willfully doesn't talk about the fact that the water vapor is higher first ahead of carbon. Which means that carbon alone isn't causing green house. Earth has gone through many climate changes in its time because the oceans take millions of years to warm up (evaporate). That becomes water vapor which acts to warm up quicker......but eventually (water cycle) the water vapor comes back down and the cooling period begins.
The carbon I'm sure makes it worse, but it's hard to say how much worse.....but it definitely can't be good to breath in toxic fumes from car exhaust and coal.

I agree with A LOT of what is being said. I have done my research, have tried to be as unbias as possible while doing so. I look through the marketing of both big oil and big green. I'm not saying weather and climate are the same thing like many Republicans do. I'm saying that if these climate scientists had the data 100% right the 3% wouldn't be reluctant nor would all the models that they've made for over 2 decades be wrong time and time again. At some point you have to go ""well,.....maybe somethings not adding up....maybe a lot of what's being told to me is just political fear mongering....or bias science like when big tobacco used to claim smoking was good for you.....

You may be right, and this willful ignorance you speak of doesn't exist on my end. I've seen both sides and yes I agree. Clean Air is good. Sustainability is great. I have kids and want a good future for them. I love nature more than cities. I'm saying you should try to be a little bit more open to the idea that people sometimes lie because they need to line their wallets. It's easy to view big oil this way because they've been painted as "" evil"" forever, but you have to look past the sitcom stereotypes on things to better understand reality.

You also should mature a little and be more tolerant of other people's beliefs. If you believe in man-made, that's great. It doesn't hurt me at all. Long as you're not knocking on doors asking me if I believe in Jesus.

It is entirely possible for people to have their own ideas on things and should be willing to hear their side. Thats how you become more intelligent. Even if it's wrong, at least you know something on the subject your against.

For now, I'm done. I can't waste more time here with ya. You believe what you want, but I urge you to be willing to pursue active learning and tolerance."
"La Verdad Buscador","2020-09-17T13:47:06Z","@KingintheMountain yes, limited government. Thats why I believe in green energy to achieve independence and self reliance.

Your biggest spokes person was a politician NOT a scientist (Al Gore). Even currently Bill Nye isn't even a climate scientist he's an engineer. You haven't even looked at the conflicting data. Also your math is wrong, 97% is the ""entire"" community. That 97% like I said are people collecting a check for studying the subject, if they found evidence that prove it doesn't exist....why would they put themselves out of work? Green energy companies rely heavily on the good vs evil persona.

Just because most people believe something to be true doesn't mean it is. I'm also not willing to rule out that humans are causing it, it's just the data is incomplete. Which you willfully continue to ignore because you just believe everything you're told instead of challenging a belief. Thats why it's become a religion / political movement....It's not about the science anymore but the domination of beliefs. Many say ""here look at this"" but it has holes in the data, then when that's pointed out assholes like you loose your shit unable to accept and respect other people's opinions. Can't ever just be like ""well this guy doesn't believe in the why, but does still wants clean energy....cool"".
But nah, got to be a tool and force an agenda on someone.

I feel bad for the 3% scientists who have to deal with people like you on a daily basis demanding submission. Their findings don't matter, the technical data doesn't matter, all that matters is.....

One of us, gobble go, one of us, gobble go"
"La Verdad Buscador","2020-09-16T19:43:27Z","@KingintheMountain you're the idiot, can't even read that I've said several times that I fully support green energy, sustainability, and alternatives. That's LITERALLY the solutions you're looking for.....

But like I said, you're hell bent on submission into everyone believing a certain aspect. Who cares? I believe in the solution even if I think the problems are different."
"La Verdad Buscador","2020-09-16T18:14:36Z","@KingintheMountain there isn't a consensus. 97% isn't 100%."
"La Verdad Buscador","2020-09-16T13:13:35Z","@KingintheMountain I'm part of the problem because I support green alternatives and sustainable living?

Or is it because I believe the cause for global warming is different than yours? Again, I believe in global warming and believe in green energy.

You asked for the 3% of scientists who disagree with the 97% and I provided that. I tend to agree with the 3% because the raw unpolitical data fits better in my opinion. The 97% are generally on the political spectrum, own green energy business that depend on the catastrophe, and researchers depend on federal funding to keep their jobs.

I don't need to concede into the notion of man made simply because most scientists agree.....especially since I'm interested in the solution. The fact that you are demanding concession is more of a problem. Science doesnt work if people can't challenge it. The whole man-made aspect pushers operate more like a jesus-camp cult in the sense that they force an belief onto people simply based on that fact ""everyone"" believes it so you have to do. Maybe if you guys focused more on the solution THAT would help. I haven't seen raw unpolitical data that supports that humans are the cause....yes, I see the 97% models and (they've been wrong for 2 decades now fyi). I see the carbon data in the ice yada yada...same old non-sense....but the 97% perpetually overlook the water vapor effect that is ahead of carbon not behind it. Carbon isn't the cause it's the result. The whole man-made theory relies on carbon being the cause. You have cults and people's lively hoods depending on man-made being real....which it could be and definitely won't rule that out. However, the raw data still doesn't prove that aspect. And I know you haven't looked yourself, you blindly assume since ""everyone's doing it"" it's right, and I can definitely say you're being had in that regard.
Look they've hive-minded you so bad you're losing your shit right now because you don't care about the solution.....you don't care that I literally want the same green energy as you.....all your side wants is blind faith and to concede to their belief system. Anyone who doesn't par take shale be ridiculed and probably somehow racist. Being close minded isn't what science should be."

Even it is true it means nothing. The Earth's climate will go down. And I've read alot of comments from people that are in there 60s and 70s that got told in elementary school that in 50 years we will all be burning up because of climate change and no one will be able to go outside. Here it is 50 years later and we're doing just fine and will be for the next 1,000 years. And guess who gives teachers most of there work for students? The govermemt. Indoctrination at it's finest."
"B4d4pp13","2020-09-07T05:35:27Z","@Meloni Oliver No. That's not the only reason. Many organizations see governemt funded organizations saying global warming is bad and just piggy back off of them and say global warming is bad and don't get more money. Some organizations that believe in global warming just say that global warming is bad because they just think global warming is an issue. There's more to it, but the main motivation for organizations supporting global warming across the globe is money. Viewership is everything to them."

That is exactly what some politicians and company's like Exxon are doing. There is far more scientific evidence supporting climate change than there is against it. Besides your claim that it's all for money is insane! Because it's not like the issue is only being talked about in America. It's being talked about around the globe. So what you are saying is that all these organizations and political parties around the world are all orchestrating this together so that they can get rich?"
"B4d4pp13","2020-09-06T06:18:39Z","@Internet surfer I like your name by the way but Global Warming is a colossal lie.

I mean think about it, why else do you think there cramming it down our throats? They don't care at all if the Earth is slowly getting warmer they'll all be dead by the time that they say the earth will get very hot because of global warming. Even if the earth gets extremely hot they'll all be in some nice bunker underground and will just wait it out. They make millions off of global warming. And all the organizations that push global warming the most are governemt funded. There's many good videos debunking climate change, global warming, whatever you want to call it. There's also articles debunking to, I'd suggest looking at those. Also Greta Thunberg is as dumb as a rock. And I don't just say that because she's 17. There all mad in the head"

"TW3F4TES5","2020-08-31T15:54:57Z","​@iq O This will by far be the longest comment I've ever written, but it seems necessary since it has become apparent you are incapable reflecting on your own and need help with it. I will also divide it up for you so that, even if you want to use the excuse that you can't be bothered to read it all, you will have none for not reading some of it. Reading just a few of the points 1-7 should be enough really.

And before you take the classic approach of cowering out and saying I have no life, know that this does in fact serve me some genuine purpose irl beyond simply arguing with a clueless stranger. Though I'll admit, this was a bit overboard even then.

It is honestly quite sad how you still think you've got a point with this pyramid thing. It's like seeing a child trying to explain something after they spent 2 minutes watching a documentary. I didn't avoid your question, it was the first thing I tackled in my previous comment, and one I've already mentioned earlier, you seem to be unable to pay enough attention however. It is meaningless to discuss the credibility of these sources, as all you people do is deny them without evidence. Tell me, where is the benefit from lying about this? Do you know how money is made? Through production and exploitation of resources. Do you know what is one of the biggest money-makers in the modern world? Oil, coal and gas. Tell me, why would any state and millions of scientists want to lie about this, when it's by far clear the best economic decision to not do so? Where exactly will the millions and billions of dollars you claimed these scientist would be bathing in come from? And how is it possible for these trillion-dollar mega-corporations to fail in giving these scientists the money needed to simply not lie? I will answer your question, I'm not sure. It's simply common knowledge and something I've learnt years ago, so I can't exactly give you a specific answer for who has conducted these tests. My best guess (which I'm pretty sure is correct) would be that it's the combined data of hundreds of different scientific expeditions throughout the years organised and sponsored from tens or hundreds of different organisations, companies and states. But let's pretend your delusions are true, let's pretend for a second that it's all lies and I'm naive for believing them. Even then, it's evident you have not the slightest clue what you're talking about. 

1.Let's recap for a second and look at some of the points you've made so far. In your very first comment you attempted to expose the ""lie"" that water levels has risen by saying you haven't seen it rise. I pointed out the official NASA data showing you that, if true, you wouldn't have been able to see the rise with your own eyes over such a long period of time. You tried to expose the ""lie"", yet you weren't aware of what the actual ""lie"" were and it turned out that your observation couldn't disprove it, regardless of whether it's true or not. Objectively stupid arguments: 1


2. Next you claimed ice melts sometimes and mentioned the example of icebergs. Here you fail to understand the big difference between the ice melting and regaining ground due to seasons and the ice receding. Once again, this argument is not dependent on whether we're being lied to or not, it's simply you misunderstanding this potential ""lie"" and thereby failing to expose it.  Objectively stupid arguments: 2

3.After that you made the comment about the ozone layer, how you experienced warmer times when you were younger and the water rise predictions 20-30 years ago. All of these statements are incredibly and objectively stupid. In the ozone layer one you try to claim that the explanation (or ""lie"" if you want) given by scientists was that it magically ""fixed itself"", but that's not at all what they're saying. It is fixing itself because we stopped using what damaged it. This point is once again simply wrong, regardless of whether anyone is lying. The next one show that you do not understand what every scientist is saying, that we're talking about an increase in average temperature, not year to year. Even if it's all a lie, it's perfectly possible for you to have experienced that. Lastly you were also plainly wrong about the predictions of water level rise 20-30 years ago. Even if it was a lie, you have were wrong in recalling how they ""lied"" back then. Objectively stupid arguments: 5

4. Next you made the point that you've read that the ozone hole closed, which nobody is saying, but ok, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and pretend as if this can be explained away with people lying. In that same comment however, you also made a ridiculous statement, claiming that you haven't seen the water levels rise by the 2007 estimates I gave. Here you proved that not only didn't you read my comment properly, where I specifically stated it was the rise by the end of century, but you seemed to forget the very thing that started it, that being the actual water level rise since 1993. Objectively stupid arguments: 6

5. Next comment you start of by saying ""Also scientists tell you"" and go on to explain how temperature changes throughout history are cyclical. Yes they are, but you fail to understand that in this same ""theory"", we are also considered to be in a warm period and if anything it should get colder, not warmer. Once again you try to expose a ""lie"" by pointing out flaws in the science you simply do not understand. Another argument you've made that is simply wrong whether it's all a lie or not. Objectively stupid arguments: 7

6. Now is when you start taking the ""you believe lies"" approach, but still you make a couple more points that are independent from this idea and can be considered objectively stupid. In this comment you claimed you've read about everything I had mentioned so far, yet as anyone not trapped in ignorance and delusions will see by now, you have certainly not done a very good job of actually understanding any of it. This is also the comment where you make it apparent that you don't know the status a ""theory"" has in science and mistake a theory for observations. I'd say both of these counts as stupid arguments, but I'll be nice: Objectively stupid arguments: 8

7. Lastly we get to where we are now, where you make the idiotic comparison between dating the age of the pyramids and observing the concentration of atmospheric gasses for the last few millions years. You make it clear that, not only do you not understand how these measurements are completely different (such as your mention of carbon dating, which really proved you've got not clue), but also how you don't properly grasp the concept of margin of error. We do know when the pyramids were built with a rough margin of error, and we do know what happened millions of years ago with a larger margin of error, but not a proportionally larger margin of error. This is also only a matter of understanding this supposed ""lie"" and not something that rely on actual evidence. Objectively stupid arguments: 9

Summary:

All these points I've stated are arguments you've made where their validity isn't dependent on whether it's all a lie because they're directed in highlighting flaws in these supposed ""lies"", not at the credibility of the sources that has backed them up, yet every single one of these arguments have a fundamental flaw in them: You simply do not understand any of it. This is why I trust the science, because people like you make it clear that you don't know what you're talking about.

And no, I haven't used Wikipedia, unlike you this is a subject I'm decently well-versed in."
"iq O","2020-08-31T14:11:36Z","@TW3F4TES5 Checked Wikipedia yet? : )  You can check 5 different places and get 5 different answers for the age of the piramids. And when you add the margin of error for carbon dating (which they used to calculate the age) you can get an error of hundreds of years. And that`s for something that happened relatively not so far back. And you telling me you know for sure what happened millions of years ago : ) Aaahhhhh smh
Sorry, tired to write here. It`s pointless.Bye."

by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall
into the trap, which we have already warned readers about. namely mistaking
symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in

they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.""

I see The plants that have already been proven to grow well in the desert with good water the desalination factory’s produces without chlorination making plant growth triple in size and quantity. 

I see In ground desert homes made with fiber building materials, and cooling from pre irrigation water systems. With tunnel air transportation systems, and solar power systems to provide all energy, and water needs. 

I see 30 degrees both north, and south of the equator turned into plush green carbon dioxide conversion plants. With reserve areas for desert diversity of course.

I see This is All from Just one human in tune with Gods design , Kendon Curtis,that these death cult eugenics enthusiasts types would snuff out for their “ final solution “ they have written on the Georgia Guide Stones in multiple languages.  That is what I see , how about you ?"

"Alan Lowey","2020-07-23T10:20:08Z","Nice video and artwork illustrations. Kudos. There's something the Exxon scientists missed in the early 80's. A modified theory of gravity and orbital inclination.
The term 'global warming' will become an icon of the past. There is a new way of thinking about climate change. I propose that Professor Andrea Ghez (UCLA) will soon prove that Einstein's theory of gravity is wrong.

There is an alternative imagery based on the idea of dark/different matter existing at the centre of the Moon which pulls on the Earth's core to create the ocean tides. The pull would be especially strong when on the same plane as the Earth to create the Spring Tides and King Tides.🌊

Evidence for a stronger gravitational pull on the orbital plane due to dark/different matter in planetary cores comes from this scientific paper: https://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8329. It appears more technical than it needs to be. They are saying that the change in distant from the Sun (eccentricity) is only between 1% and 5% and so is way too small to generate the glaciers of ice ages. The orbit of the Earth also goes up and down in a more direct 100,000-year cycle (inclination) and so is a better fit to the data. They lack a credible mechanism but didn't think of an increase in tidal gravity as Earth's orbit traverses the orbital plane of Jupiter. This increase in tidal strength would bring extra precipitation to the polar regions. The increase in snowfall accumulates at a greater rate than summer melting, leading to glacial buildup and advance. The ice ages have little to do with the Sun, much more with the failed star Jupiter.

Further evidence comes from the 405,000-year climate cycle which is attributed to Jupiter and Venus: https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/05/07/milankovitch-cycles-deep-time/.
Note that the gravitational effect of Jupiter is 1/10,000 that of the Moon and therefore requires a modification to gravity to 'make it work'. Similarly with Venus.

Note that the official explanation is that  they ""perturb the Earth's orbit"" to create the largest glacial cycle of them all. https://www.universetoday.com/139198/jupiter-and-venus-change-earths-orbit-every-405000-years/.

But this still only makes the Earth at most 5% further away from the Sun. The dark/different matter theory is a better fit to the data. Jupiter causes extra tidal strength on the 100,000-year cycle and Venus brings even more every 4th cycle. 

Evidence for periodic increased tidal strength in past climate is given in the following paper which states ""..extreme Arctic penetration of warm North Atlantic waters."" This is attributable to the addition of the 1,470-year lunar climate cycle. The next cycle I estimate  to commence in around 750 years, so plenty of time for humanity to prepare itself for the biggest changes to come.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033589499921233

It will all be confusing to start with but is understandable to a layperson given enough thought.
...
A quick google search will find that precipitation has been increasing in both Antarctica, Greenland and Norway:

""Scientists have compiled a record of snowfall in Antarctica going back 200 years. The study shows there's been a significant increase in precipitation over the period, up 10%. The effect of the extra snow locked up in Antarctica is to slightly slow a general trend in global sea-level rise.""

Similarly in Norway, with a very high rate of maritime precipitation, both precipitation and snowfall are increasing.

I predict that this will increase exponentially eventually halting the trend in global sea-level rise.

Unfortunately it appears that increasing precipitation in Greenland is currently falling as rain which will lead to increased melting, which will offset the Antarctic/Nordic accumulation in the short term.

Sea-level change is just a part of climate change. Heat is redistributed from the equatorial regions towards the polar regions via increasing tides. The warming is much greater in the Northern hemisphere due to the unidirection of Earth's orbit as it traverses the orbital plane of Jupiter in this current cycle.

A test for this hypothesis is to actively measure tidal height changes in the mid latitudes. I predict a small but exponential increase in tidal strength over time. Another consequence of dark/different matter core interaction will be increased mantle convection bringing extra heat to the Earth's inner crust. Bore holes from 1km to 5km can test for any increase in rock temperature. I predict a small but exponential increase in rock temperature over time.

I am not ""anti-Greta"" as she is right that governments and industry need to take climate change much more seriously. Naomi is right in that the science needs to be settled first and that CO2 emissions shouldn't be targeted in an attempt to 'control the climate'. There is a new middle ground way of thinking and both Naomi and Greta have much more positive work ahead of them.
.....
♨️There is also the potential for a new green energy source based on dark/different matter which theoretically would have been brought to Earth by past comet impact events.

A 'theory of everything' is expected to bring a new world economic revolution of unimaginable prosperity. ♥️"

"Væringjar","2020-07-15T17:08:34Z","Jewelry Springer EV’s are definitely better. If we just take out the CO2 argument for a moment. Limiting particle pollution in cities is a win for everybody. 

The general complaint about EV’s are that they are coal powered, well, there’s an easy fix to that. Stop using coal! I’ve lived on two different power grids in my adult life, one was 100% renewable, the one i live in now is about 50%. So already there my EV would be a net benefit to CO2 emissions. But the larger discussion is not about now, it’s about the electrification of out future society, and EV’s are going to play a vital part in that. They can stabilise the energy grid, if powered by intermittent renewables, but it’s a transition, and the more we invest now, the sooner we can have a fully electrified society, and be carbon neutral."
"BLUE FLOWERS","2020-07-15T16:49:58Z","This is a link to the Harvard study I'm referencing (it's more or less regurgitated by most pro EV arguments. https://www.google.com/amp/s/thedriven.io/2019/12/09/are-evs-cleaner-than-ice-coal-grid/amp/

Also noteworthy is that 150k miles is not the avg lifetime of a typical vehicle. I would argue that the people who buy an EV with 150k miles on it are not exactly able to afford new batteries to bring their vehicles back up to par regarding milage per charge. Whereas 150k miles plus ICE's still get the same milage for the most part. 

Used EVs  with >/= 150k miles on them will get substantially worse miles per charge and therefore emit substantially more carbon. Down the line this will become a huge factor as the EV ages and gets less and less miles per charge. No? These EVs will end up on the road for 300k miles as they will last longer than ICE's not less and be emitting 200% plus at that point. No one buys a high milage car intending to spend the money to make it equal to a new one efficiency wise. 

So even the pro-EV industry experts require a maximum life of 150k for all vehicles and minimum 13% of all coal companies electric come from renewable sources to claim EVs emit less. 

Well 13% is not true. And 150k plus mole vehicles are definitely on the road and EVs will end up on the road past 300k miles on average (50% of an EV's life will be emitting far more for certain and arguably the initial 50% will be emitting roughly the same if only 87% are running on coal. 

See where I'm going? Are EVs therefore worse?"
"BLUE FLOWERS","2020-07-15T16:30:59Z","@Væringjar  ...and what do you make of the electric vehicle debate? Seems the studies are all biased and manipulative (for and against). I've been pointed to a few ""leading studies"" and it seems upon the claim that EVs emit less than combustion engines, a lot of head scratching calculations are being used. Notably EVs emit 66 metric tons in a lifetime vs 69 metric tons in a lifetime for ice's, though this requires an assumption of 13% minimum renewable energy coming from any given coal plant. How many coal plants meet that? If it's below the avg, why is it being touted? 99% of electric vehicles are powered by coal. Assumption of at least 13% coming from renewable sources eliminated, EVs emit more than ICE's. So with the exception of few zipcodes in California, electric vehicles emit more carbon, specifically 74.58 metric tons per 150k miles, vs. Combustion vehicles at 69 metric tons per 150k miles. 

Solar seems obvious, however in application/practice sounds almost unimaginable? 

High speed rail? Bicycles?"
"BLUE FLOWERS","2020-07-15T16:07:57Z","@Væringjar  enlightening, thanks. I got to looking into it further and even the most violent eruptions can only match co2 released by humans during the eruptions. So basically we're emitting the equivalent of a permanent/perpetual super eruption. Good grief!"
"Væringjar","2020-07-15T11:22:57Z","The sun getting hotter is not noticeable on smaller timescales, the milankovitch cycles create a lot more variability on the short term. This however can not explain the current warming trend. https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/189/graphic-temperature-vs-solar-activity/

We can do relatively precise estimation on the the anthropogenic component on climate change however. Humans contribute about 3% to the yearly carbon flux. Volcanoes emit around 200 million tons, and humans emit around 29 billion tons. So volcanoes are not a concern in terms of CO2 emitted."

"gemma hudack","2020-06-28T20:04:44Z","David Stone Ok there’s a lot to address with what you’ve said. Number one, temperatures around the globe are down currently because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global emissions are down for the moment, so temperatures being down isn’t surprising. Second, you’ve confused weather with climate. Weather is short term and can change based on several factors, notably seasons. Climate is long term, you don’t see its effects on a day to day basis. Climate is examined in years, sometimes decades. 

https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature

The graph shows that since the 1800’s (when the industrial revolution began and humans began significantly affecting the climate) average global temperatures have increased by nearly 2 degrees. Third, China and India do emit a significant amount of green house gases. However, the US also emits much more significantly. Additionally China actually is one of the global leaders in green technology. The reason why the United States should be the global leader in decarbonizing is because we are a developed economy that pollutes significantly. We can afford to decarbonize, unlike developing economies like India. China and India are undergoing their industrial revolutions now. So they should decarbonize as soon as they can afford to. 

What are the advantages of decarbonizing the United States? First of all our decarbonization would be significant to global emissions. Second of all it would encourage other countries to decarbonize, likely the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, EU, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. Third, the United States would become the leader in green solutions, creating massive economic growth. Fourth, it would allow the United States to continue to be highly influential in the world, without the need of wars. The US is still the world’s largest market, a green economy that could begin decarbonizing the world would be immensely influential to our diplomacy.

I want to end this open letter of sorts by saying this. I do not think you are stupid, uneducated, etc. I think you have been lied to, and that’s not your fault. It’s the fossil fuel, petrochemical, etc. Industry that have bought our politicians, news outlets, etc. to lie to every American about this."

When plants grow the sun is absorbed and photosynthesis results so without the plants the ground heats up and the heat is radiated not the case when sun hits plants, the energy is transmuted to growth of wood, which is also energy but not radiated into the environment until it's burnt. 
The idea there's a layer of carbon dioxide above the earth reflecting heat is just an idiots fantasy,  it's a gas distributed everywhere evenly moving through pressure gradients and wind until it's everywhere in equal concentration.

The thing about computer simulation models is that the input affects the output, meaning if you put in the required inputs, you will obtain your desired output that is manipulated by you in the first place by supplying rigged inputs to meet your sinister intentions of agenda 21. If their computer simulation models were accurate wrt the current global conditions, then people in New York and other coastal cities would now be swimming to go from one place to another. But is that the case? Did you ever consider this fact : sun is behind global warming and not carbon dioxide? Yes carbon dioxide traps the heat, but without that,ie, the greenhouse effect, we could be headed for the next mega ice where temperatures could plummet to sub zero. And moreover, we all breathe out carbon dioxide and plants inhale them to prepare food that we in-turn consume. This natural food cycle wouldn’t be possible without carbon dioxide. Pollution is harmful for the lungs, yes but it isn’t the cause of global warming and hence climate change. Global warming occurs when greenhouse gases trap the heat of the sun within the atmosphere, without which life wouldn’t be possible on this planet. They have brainwashed us from the start that we humans are dangerous and that our very existence is a bad omen to this planet. But without us, plants would die, and hence this planet will become a rotten, dying barren land. Infact, it was much hotter during the 1500’s than it is now. That period is called the mediaeval warm period and you do know that there was no pollution whatsoever back then. SUN WAS, IS AND WILL BE THE CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING AND HENCE, CLIMATE CHANGE ON PLANET EARTH. Period."

"Alisha","2020-05-04T17:25:12Z","and the data your getting is from Nasa and Noaa Both are lying. They modified the data. There is no definitive proof that carbon gases is to do with climate change. There was a climate change in 1900 - 1945 and they didn't have as much carbon gases as we have now and yet they had a warming event. Climate change is a natural event that happens every 50-100 years but someone online has spread a little lie that has become a huge lie that carbon gases are the blame for climate change. I live in Australia in one f the Hottests states ""Queensland"" and this years summer wasn't as hot as 7 years ago's summer it is cooler this year and the winter is getting colder.t We just had a small event of cooling over most the states ""NSW, ACT, VIC, QLD, SA"" that dropped the temps in late summer from the normal at nights that are around 20 degree's C down to 1-10 degree's C some even lower for 4 days and in the days it was 10-20 degree's C lower then what they normally are. I'd say it's getting colder, not warmer. I maybe warmer in some countries but you can't state a fact on every country in the world. Look up on youtube ""The raw data on ""climate change"""" and watch that and see the truth. Even a former Noaa scientist that studied climate whistleblower that Noaa and Nasa were modifying the data to fictional facts and the real data is showing that its cooling not heating up also that there is no proof that carbon gases have anything to do with climate change. Noaa and Nasa put the former scientist down and tried to make him look like a fool.. Well I believe the whistleblower because if you don't then you're ok with the NSA using prism to spy on all your personal and private lives.. But lucky they had a whistleblower ""Snowden"". And all the truth and whistleblowers from Wikileaks. So many people believe in the governments and that's fine go ahead but just know that whistleblowers don't whistle the truth unless it means something as they are pretty much ruining their lives, to tell the truth."

Then they changed it to climate change so they could always fear monger and try to over-regulate. The number of Mines that were never opened fracking that was never done and the number of jobs lost was astounding, also to diversify the energy industry don't go for sun, and air-powered stuff they are fickle they can stop producing, in fact, Germany had so many problems going renewable. No Water and Nuclear is the way to go. Nuclear is not as dangerous as one might think, in fact, the reason that Chernobyl, Fukushima, and the one in Pennsylvania went critical is because of them being made faulty on purpose. Chernobyl was caused by the Russians not correctly building the site, Fukushima was caused by not preparing for the eventuality that would be typhoons and tsunamis and earthquakes."

As for climate change, I thinks it's real but I think of it in a different way. If you haven't noticed earth is a planet of change and mother nature is never constant all we can do is speculate about what may happen to the weather and The earth's climate. In a way earth is like a Pandora's box  you just don't really know what you'll get it's unpredictable. Can we influence the climate? Absolutely but for the most part what will happen to earth will be preordained as earth takes part in a cycle of change and it warms and cools, the planet's surface changes land masses secumb to eachother or the earth's tectonic plates and will be swallowed back into the bellows of the earth's crust and new land masses will appear even down to the biomes. The reason why we think this is the end times if it gets too extreme is because we as a species don't like change that that's the same exact reason for why we hate modern architecture, if modern architecture much like our planet never changed we would accept but earth is just to usher I a new age to become a new planet surface wise so that we may experience the next chapter in it beauty. Now matter what happens earth will be earth untill the sun goes super nova, that only that will change will be the weather and surface but as the ice ages prove it will just be a cycle and thousands of years or more, idk how many years but probably alot it may go back to it's temperate nature like has been for the past thousands of years. earth is a planet of change, but it is also a planet of ordered chaos."

By the way, science does not work like a democracy. Just because a majority claims something, doesn't mean it is right or good. I am not saying that humans do not play a role in climate change.

I agree that nuclear waste has been effectively stored and no incidences of leakage have been reported in the US, but the process of extracting nuclear material for nuclear power plants is itself unclean. The concern here is that many miners, especially those in underdeveloped countries, may not often have access to PPE or that the radioactive materials may leak into the pipes and water supply of local communities. I find that this point is often poorly addressed by nuclear advocates and that if nuclear energy is to be sustainable, it should also be sustainable on inputs."

1,Explicitly endorses and quantifies AGW as 50+% : 64
2,Explicitly endorses but does not quantify or minimize: 922
3,Implicitly endorses AGW without minimizing it: 2910
4,No Position: 7970
5,Implicitly minimizes/rejects AGW: 54
6,Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW but does not quantify: 15
7,Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW as less than 50%: 9

So 64 out of 11,944, or 0.5%, take the view that humans are the main cause of global warming. But that includes all abstracts, including those that did not take a position. It would be nice to take the 64 as a percent of those that did take a position. Unfortunately, in their data set, Cook et al put 4a, those that do not address the cause of global warming, with 4b, those that express the view that humans’ role in global warming is uncertain or undefined. It would be nice to separate them, but we can’t unless we have the even rawer data. So let’s generously conclude that everyone in category 4 has expressed no view. That’s a total of 7970, leaving a total of 3,974 that have expressed a view. The 64 who think the main cause is humans is, drum roll please: *1.6%*.

Key points: ""We investigate glaciers along a 2000-km transect from Spiti Lahaul to Bhutan (75°E to 93°E), which includes glaciers that accumulate snow primarily during winter (western Himalayas) and during the summer monsoon (eastern Himalayas), *but excludes complications of surging glaciers in the Karakoram and Kunlun regions where many glaciers appear to be anomalously stable or advancing.* ""

""Our compilation includes glaciers comprising approximately 34% of the total glacierized area in the region...""


Melting glaciers? based on only 34% of the glaciers.

Yeah this is just one example. 



Glaciers near a water source recede more than those without a water source as a rule of thumb and yes that has been documented for whatever the reasons.

"CD Marshall","2020-04-04T02:55:32Z","@MeowPau The surface heats up the atmosphere. Oceans cause melting, take another look at glaciers melting with some honest feedback next time. Some glaciers are melting, others are growing and others aren't changing at all. If the ""atmosphere"" was doing it ALL would be melting not a variation of all three. Geothermal activity in the oceans and on land contributes to a lot of that, warmer oceans as in natural cycles or disrupted cycles (geothermal activity) in the oceans causes much of that as well. Point being not ""one thing blames all"" works in real science.



Warming is a natural cycle, the Earth goes through it. Melting glaciers don't cause much sea level rise, water run off does from land coupled with landfall (sinking land), and that includes more rainfall. 



Look at sea levels, they aren't consistent world wide meaning its not from a rise in ocean levels overall its local."

Now, I'm no expert and I'm going off of many things I have learned from many sources. For one, in prehistoric times the entire Earth was a tropical climate and had one of the richest atmospheres throughout all of its existence. The oxygen was so rich that it caused insects to grow to extreme proportions. Of course, this required many forests to build off one another, but that does not mean that it was the end of the world. Once again, I'm no expert, I'm just throwing things out there. But consider that after this tropical climate of a planet, Earth froze up and turned into an ice age. Would it not be normal for nature to take its course and warm up gradually over time? Even when we weren't burning fossil fuels the Earth was warming. In my humble opinion, what's happening is natural, but the speed in which it is happening at is accelerated by we the people of the gracious planet that lets us live here.

The original study was of uncertainty and NOW used to frame ""big oil"" to stop the debate. How are ""Big oil"" going to suffer when 1. we still need oil as there is no short term replacement 2. we still need oil for a massive array of products.
That said the science is there that shows:
1) Human contributions are less that 5%
2) So that is 5% of 0.4% suddenly driving our climate? err NO. why?
2a. It is physically impossible for one molecule to heat another 2000 (like heating one brick would heat a house!
2c All matter radiates heat without exception. The IR part that makes CO2 ""special"" has a saturation that means adding more has little effect. It is also dwarfed by water vapor that does the same.
2d The idea of this all started with Mr Mann and his fake data (that he never produced in court and so lost the case against)
2e The tree ring study had other contradicting studies but they where ignored due to his arrogant nature. Also it was done in bad area.
2f The warming is what is causing the CO2 increase not the other way around (as the past millions of years also show CO2 did not drive temperature then either)
2g The molar mass version of the ideal gas law proved that adding to the mass of the atmosphere a tiny increase can be calculated if CO2 is doubled (less that 0.5 C) or any other.

If the oil companies convince you that you should not be burning oil and you should be taxed for it then they can create false scarcity. Scarcity means that the price of their product goes up along with their products. These 'elites' can also control your very movements by rationing the amount of fuel you can burn. Controlling the cost and availability of goods is the way all totalitarian governments increase control."

"Grant Rev-NZ","2020-03-04T23:20:52Z","When i saw the title , i thought , ""Here we go another denier"". Then when it first started and i saw your face , i was disappointed. Another younger person on the wrong side.
It took milliseconds to realize , you are on the right side.


I am a bit depressed and starting to feel its hopeless. 
I live in New Zealand , we have just had a very hot summer. It has taught me about eco systems  , not being able to cope with the temp changes.


New Zealand is in the safest place , apart from Norway  , when talking about moving to avoid the worst.
As far as i can evaluate from the net
And what seems hot to NZ may be considered mild , in other parts of the globe.


But to all or little animals , insects , and native plants ,  ""IT IS A DEATH SENTENCE""
We have some very pretty native birds , black robin , fantail , the list is huge.
These birds evolved in NZ , and were never repeated in any other location on the globe.
And already they are dying.  
 
We have the KIWI , this bird is nocturnal , so much so , that our department of conservation , has found young kiwi are starting to evolve without eyes. I think this  is only one specific type of Kiwi.


You can look for Kiwi for years and never see one, hiding a cam is about the only way we have ever been able to see them in the wild.
But this summer a woman on a bush walk , came across a KIWI out in the open.


It was a hot sunny day , and the KIWI had come into the open to drink from a stream.
The only explanation for such unseen behavior , is the kiwi was close to death  .


That is the only reason  this little nocturnal bird  , would risk coming out , or even be awake during daylight hours.
So NZ is already in big trouble.
But still no signs of any real public concern or proper awareness .
Why? , because so many people are still ok.
It seems people will do piss all , until the food crops fail , or the water fails to flow into the hose.


The hose that people use to wash their car. Yes it is water that can be drunk.
Its great water. So while Robins , Fantails , Kiwis , native plants and countless insects die from thirst , we may think its sad , but we still have to wash our cars with water . Water that would have saved countless living beings.


For years now , i only wash my vehicle , when its raining. No hose ever , and i dont use any soaps.
just a soft cloth , wiping over the car while it is raining.
Sure its certainly no fun , so what.
I have a dish washer and dont use any soap , its interesting as most times all dishes look great.


If not then clean them in a very small amount of water in the sink , and soap if needed.
It will only be a couple of items at the most. 
Always wait until dish wash is full , and make sure its lean on its water use.
A good washer will save water and using no soap is a great feeling , if you wanted to kill a living plant or animal , feed it one dish washer soap tablet , it will die.


I cut my power bills in half , turned down hot water , not to much as i like the water very hot , and replaced all bulbs with L.E.D.
Our speed limit is 100 kms , on the motorway i stick to slower lane and travel at 90 ,  i could not believe the result when i first started , it saved 20 dollars per tank.


The more you try to save the planet , the more money you have left over every week.
I have started a separate savings account  , and what i can save buy being eco aware goes into the account.


I hope to one day buy an affordable all electric car , from this account.
Then it will be free , and hope to also be able to charge it at home with solar panels on my roof.


Anyway climate change is happening right now , and i have seen it ramping up big time in the last 5 summers.
It is going to get us all , no matter where we live , and its going to be a nightmare.


I have an idea , if someone could start a movement , the consumer power of spending , for example.
This movement could advertise , no fuel to be purchased at any Mobil station for a week , then shell , then caltex etc etc.


The message would be , start changing to electric vehicle stations with fast charge technology.
Invest your profits into electric vehicle research and even manufacture.
Invest your profits into , wind , solar , and ,  viable replacement for fuels currently damaging the planet.


Then slowly start extending the time frame when not spending at certain stations , so from one week to two weeks etc etc.
At the first sign that any company like shell or Mobil are indeed hearing the message , and provocatively coming up with solutions , then the movement can advise all members to support those company's only .


The others will soon follow , they will have no choice.
If they go under , so be it.


The same could be done to supermarkets to help reduce plastic.


Cheers Grant"

The first question asked, “When compared with pre-1800 levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?” The second asked, “Do you think that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”
Ninety percent of the respondents said that the mean temp had risen, while 82 percent said that human activity was a significant factor. However, the term “significant” was never defined. Furthermore, according to the Heartland Institute, most skeptic scientists would agree with the statistic if the term was defined.
The video explains that when formulating the 97 percent statistic, researchers used only the responses from “climate scientists.” However, only 5 percent of the respondents – 79 people – were climate scientists.

So, out of 10,257 academics that the professor and graduate student identified as worthy survey participants, only 79 were in agreement with their final finding. When calculated, those 79 scientists – now accepted as 97 percent - make up a meager 0.77 percent of academics. And, since only 97 percent of the 79 answered positively (which would be 76.63 people – so we will round to 77), the percentage shrinks from 0.77 percent to 0.75 percent.

For example, in Genesis, every species on earth, plants, animals, and mankind are created by God according to their ""kinds"".  This means that each has a unique function and appearance.

Romans 8, expresses that the earth longs for the redemption of Christ who will restore paradise lost. Lastly, the Bible teaches that perilous times will come, children against parents, lawlessness, God-haters, proud, boastful, cold-hearted,  and natural disasters-all this will intensify as the Lord's returns approach (2 Timothy 3; Mark 13)."

Eventually the ""crisis"" blew over when the computer model that made the forecast was found to have had an error in its calculations. Then there was the ice age prediction. Then there was the melting of the ice caps.  Young people will believe anything. I did too but there was no internet then to perpetuate the nonsense and inflame it. Just because some folk were trying to bury some information, it does necessarily mean that information was true. And just because CO2 may have caused a small increase in temperature it doesn't necessarily mean that increasing volumes of CO2 will cause commensurate temperature rises beyond that. Young people should really be wary of older folks who are setting them up to be used in all of this. In ten years time you'll look back and see that you took your eye off the ball."
"Michael Nunn","2020-02-12T00:46:48Z","The long version took months of research and comparison plus logic. This is a short version.
Note the omissions and contradictions in any model or theory. 
Note the complexity and feasibility demanded by the brief.
Climate Change model and theory fail on all counts.
Omission: no account of waste heat from Mankind’s combustion based activity.
Contradiction: CO2 and Waste heat are BOTH are the product of combustion. CO2 adds no heat, it only limits the escape of heat into Space (Green House Effect).  The Waste heat part does not appear in the Model and Theory for Global Warming. So how come CO2 from Mankind’s activities is blamed for global warming?
Complexity: Nature has determined the status quo for millennia. The available processes are myriad. Most include a feedback control mechanism. This implies that return to stability takes time. To model Nature requires long term data over many cycle of disturbance from the stable state. Nature’s mechanisms control within a set of rules and behaviour.  Conservation of Matter is a key one that requires Carbon mass in either gas, solid or liquid form to be fixed. 
Feasibility: Mankind’s activities are restricted to the inhabited surface of the Globe (about 10%) and to a massive extent to the densely populated areas. These areas are poorly distributed around the Globe. It is claimed that CO2 emissions quickly spread globally to give equal concentration.
 HOWEVER, Warming from Mankind’s activity is, as we inevitably all witness, a local phenomenon, which Nature distributes through its complex feedback processes.
Weather and Climate Theory and Models choose either CO2 (Climate) and Heat Energy (weather). Neither use both.  A composite model is not feasible. It could not meet the complexity  nor satisfy the brief."

This then  leads to uncertain and unpredictable weather. We are also entering another grand solar minimum. This increases cloud nucleation which as of 2020 has been allowed to be part of the 2022 climate models. Look for that. In short we are on the cusp of not only falling into another 200-plus year solar minimum but a 80000 year glacial period.expect rapidly moving magnetic poles, destabilization of the jet stream initially, then increased volcanic and tectonic activity. if you really care about saving the planet and humanity try doing something about the 700+ nuclear facilities that will abruptly go offline during the next Carrington event.

The life and role of Maurice Strong is key to understanding how the myth of anthropogenic global warming was created and how it was used to establish the context for Agenda 21, arguably the most significant and most secretive plan for global transformation we have witnessed; more significant than the two world wars of the last century. As such, I feel it is important to understand how this has been unfolded in our world.
Arguably, the notion of scarcity as an issue for humanity as a result of human behaviour was given perhaps its first serious outing via the Club of Rome, with its 1972 report “The Limits to Growth”. This report contained projections that, if they had been accurate, would have seen us running out of most of the world’s resources by the end of the last century, if my memory serves me correctly. I remember reading it not long after it came out, in my student days, and being very concerned about the impact of these projections. It turned out to be a very healthy piece of fear-mongering by the global elite, perhaps their first step down this path.

Today as I look back, I now understand that our world had no need for an oil-based economy, except it served the interests of that same elite to promote and sustain it, and then use its likely scarcity as a powerfully ramped tax on the global population. Nikola Tesla demonstrated how to harvest the background energy field back in the early 20th century, but was stopped in his tracks by JP Morgan, a powerful banking agent of the Rothschilds."

"Deep Thought","2020-02-11T06:19:58Z","In the 1920s climatologists (no climate scientists back then) were warning that the earth was rapidly cooling and if it was allowed to continue we would face dramatic extremes of weather, reduction of farming land (terrible starvation and displacement of poorest nations around the world), lack of drinking water, and we need to start taking action before the event becomes a disaster. Various predictions were made that never occurred.

Until the 1970s when it was postulated that actually the world was warming and not cooling (at least not in the next 1000 years or so)... This time they were sure climatologists had got it right and NASA (desperately short of funds and ideas since the space race was won) joined in. 

Al Gore and his Oscar winning “an inconvenient truth” blasted the fear of a warming Earth across our screens and all but started the Global Climate movement. Warming would cause desert wastes, lack of drinking water, displacement of people, extreme weather events including hurricanes and fires and so on far beyond those we have ever had... ( btw we actually only have 100-140 years of semi-solid climate data and only for some select parts of the globe )... the Earth is approximately 4,500,000,000 years old. So action was urgently needed. His prediction thought based on “solid science” and accolades from the climate society at the time - that most of our coasts would be under water, have proven to be greatly exaggerated.

So now we have stage 3...Climate Change. Neither warming nor cooling just different and the IPCC (was formed by the UN in 1988 to put a scientific face to climatologists and to give them more credibility ) started using the term Climate Scientists (btw why are podiatrists not called foot Drs?)
UN are the people who put - Arafat - the head of a known terrorist organisation, in charge of their Anti Terrorist Task force and got him a Nobel Peace Prize.

It brought to my mind the words of the writer and philosopher George Santayana, who said, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""

Ok let’s take the science route... 
Science owes its success to the scientific method of investigating the universe around us. This method was described to me by my teacher as coming up with a theory of how something works, developing every possible way to try to disprove that theory, getting others involved in trying to disprove the theory and only when everyone has failed to disprove it time and time again, finally having to accept that the theory must be correct. It is this incredibly high level of scepticism that gives science its trustworthy and repeatable nature and allows us to use science to correctly predict extrapolations of existing facts into new and untested territories with a high degree of success.

So the next time someone tells you the science on something is settled and calls you a denier or a sceptic you can thank them for confirming your adherence to the core principles of science and not on faith - needed due to the fact it’s based on emotion and a total lack of facts.

We are currently in our 5th ICE age (google Quaternary glaciation if you don’t know this) and during these ice ages 70-95 percent of the earth is often covered with ice... that’s global cooling. We are in a warmer part of this period so not so bad atm. During our planets “normal” period the oceans were 152 feet above where they are now and temps around 50 deg C were common.

During previous ice ages people traveled along ocean floors to other continents - oceans got that low... 

The fossil fuels that everyone is now so worried about came from fossilised remains of living plants and animals that were living on the surface of our world during its longest and most vibrantly lush and diverse period. The carbon released burning fuels is the same carbon that was above ground for millions of years during the dinosaurs reign. 

We live on a world that is essentially a closed system. The water we drink today has been recycling through the guts of dinosaurs and plants for those same millions of years. The balance of chemicals in this planetary system are fixed with the exception of tiny amounts that get fired off into space or brought here by meteorites, or locked temporarily away by being sealed in the soil/rock by tremors or tar pits etc. but essential the carbon we have is the same carbon that existed when the earth came into existence. Only how much is in the atmosphere changes from time to time... the absolute amount that is within our system does not change much at all.

Anthropogenic Climate Change is the hypothesis that man, through his actions, is able to influence climate upon our planet. This is also the first stage of a process called terraforming. Which is the “hypothetical process of deliberately modifying a planet’s atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the environment of Earth” so as to make it liveable for Earth creatures. The idea is to be able to manipulate the climate to be the way we want it to be and not the way nature wants it to be.

So what is the right climate? Depends on who you talk to, right? 
I love cold days in front of the fireplace in the misty mountains but my wife loves steamy hot tropical nights near the ocean. Who are we to determine what is optimal for the entire planet and all its various life forms? Only human arrogance would dare believe our wants matter more than all other creatures because we currently rule. 

Dinosaurs ruled the planet for millions of years, we have barely been here for around 45,000 years and they have been pretty shaky years at that, with us almost wiping ourselves out multiple times already.

"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day","2020-02-06T08:27:26Z","*TOP 10 REASONS TO DOUBT CLIMATE CHANGE AKA GLOBAL WARMING*

1. Our species went through multiple ice ages and global warmings. The current global warming started approximately 12,000 years ago. That's how the last ice age ended and the current geological period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won't last forever. Interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years. So, we have between 8,000 and 48,000 years until the next ice age.

2. The rate at which the sea level is rising now is much lower compared to how it rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago – a period in which the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the *Early Holocene Sea Level Rise* if you want to learn more.

3. The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the ""stability"" of the climate, you might want to look up:
– *The 8.2 Kiloyear Event*
– *The Little Ice Age*
– *The Year Without a Summer (1816)*

4. *Chaos Theory* tells us why the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum, for example – https://youtu.be/U39RMUzCjiU. No one can predict the climate.

5. Computer simulations of chaotic systems have no predictive value because the initial conditions can never be measured with sufficient accuracy. Such simulations only generate pretty pictures on a screen. Again, no one can predict the behavior of chaotic systems. Because – *Chaos Theory!*

6. Compared to water, CO₂ plays an insignificant role in the global greenhouse effect. Because – and I'm not making this up – *95% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor.* 

7. CO₂ is _not_ a pollutant. CO₂ is plant food. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis – a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO₂ and water. Without CO₂ plants die. Without plants, we die. CO₂ is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO₂ is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery. There are real pollutants out there we should be worried about and CO₂ is not one of them.

8. Compared to astronomical factors like solar activity or the _Milankovitch Cycles_ or terrestrial factors like volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We're not that significant.

9. This may came as a shock to you, but we're actually in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation – the *Quaternary Glaciation* – look it up!

10.  There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of anthropogenic climate change. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who essentially said Global Warming is pseudoscience – https://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0. Freeman Dyson said that ""Climate Change predictions are absurd"" – https://youtu.be/fmy0tXcNTPs Wikipedia has a _List of scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming,_ but it only contains the names of those scientists ""who have their own Wikipedia article."" Keep in mind that science doesn't work by consensus. Science isn't a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:

“Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.”"

Heavier fractions - lubricants, building materials, cracked to make more fuels
How good is that.

One day there won't be much easy to access oil so we need alternatives to not have a sharp drop in energy production. So with a large burst of fossil fuel energy we can build the alternatives and have time to improve the alternatives. Can you see that oil is a gift that should not be wasted.

Not only that, fossil fuels will open the way to developing far better technology and infrastructure, even mobile infrastructure so productivity can continue where ever we may be and also people will be able to live in many places (including on the water or dare we say it in the air on platforms or vehicles)."

There have been many predictions of the catastrophic effects of CC, but all of them have been wrong. 100% wrong. No one has acknowledged or apologise for the errors, they just move the date of doom out and make another prediction. CC is a not a crisis without real catastrophy. Please show me any past catastrophic prediction that have come true. Have there been adjustments in the modeling to ensure that future predictions will be right?

One problem you didn't touch with ""faster rates of global warming"" is that ground based temperature data is where the majority of the warming is being observed. The problem with this, is that the majority of the long term stations are situated in areas that WERE in undeveloped locations, but are NOW surrounded by development. The ""Urban Heat Island Effect"" is biasing the temperature data up, in proportion to land development.

For instance, I live in a medium size American city (actually, county), which is surrounded in all direction by rural (undeveloped) counties. On any given day throughout the year, our country is 2°F to 4°F warmer than the surrounding counties, in ANY direction (N,S,E, or W). My county is likely to have hundreds of times more temperature stations than the surrounding counties and therefore is more strongly biases the temperature data. This is generally the case all around the world."

No one denies CLIMATE CHANGE FOOL, NEVER HAVE ,they disagree on your or EXXONS prognsis. By closing your mind to ther scientists who challenge your Global warming computer models you actually cause tunnel vision , hence will wonder why the next 2 decades of Climate change will be cooling NOT heating. Sadly by demonising one gas out of hundreds your simplistic ""cure"" IS unachievable. No doubt by the year 2100 many of todays kids will have gone thru what we did in the 70, 80s and 90s , ie: a predicted ice age , a collapse in the ozone layer ,a 3.0m rise in sea levels ,all which NEVER occured. I thunk you would serve yourself better in the science field Questioning why so many government funded Scientists use SELECTIVE DATA, but completely IGNORE Other Data that shows Growth of parts of the arctic. The fact you focus on Co2 as the be all and end all shows how little you truly have delved into REAL CLIMATE CHANGE OF 100s of thousands if not millions of years ,not the mere 100 to 200 years (a grain of sand in time ) of this planet. The earth evolves ,it compensates for changes over time , much like  most things in nature. Now before you cry Denier ,Im all for a cleaner planet ,but your arguments of STOPPING ALL CO2 emissions would actually kill us all. Your science is flawed and hundreds of scientists who believed in global warming now have started to accept that. Sadly they are replaced by the Globalist funded propaganda machine and good and real scientists who now question this OLD Global warming agenda are ridiculed and demonised for no other reason than they Actually have watch the modelling manipulated and the predictions made getting bigger and bigger in their errors. Hence with each passing year the error rate grows worse as the figures are out further and further. Facts are the earth warms and cools in cycles. Using ""the end of the earth is nigh"" alarmism and trying to believe you can change global weather patterns to suit yr agendas and even worse is the delusion you can actually Control Climate is laughable. Best you at least do something achievable because unless your plan is to somehow make china ,India and the rest of the world giving up cheap power ,and all that is produced off of it (inc.solar panels, wind turbines ,steel ,your lithuum batteries) your doomed to FAIL. Please dont give me the ""better than doing nothing scenario. That doesnt stand up either . Virtue signalling this generation is going to ""save tbe world"" is a Carbon copy (pun intended) of the last 3 generations. Yes ,perhaps in the near future  over time ,as new discoveries are made cheaper and more reliable efficient energy systems will be implemented , but as it stands now all you are doing is causing children mental health problems, anxiety and hate.

Also their is an arrogance in regards to the human impact. As many of these changes are simply following a natural cycle. Which has caused multiple 'ice-ages' in the   past, before humans invented machines. A single volcanic eruption can cause more 'greenhouse  gasses' to be expelled than the equivalent of many years of human usage of Fossil Fuels. Sure humans do play a roll though this is probably less than 20% of the change being attributed to industrialization. Nature has been following these cycles for years and we are more likely to be heading towards the next 'ice age' than the crazy belief of a runaway greenhouse effect such as present on Venus. If this truly was the issue one could simply argue that a 10 year nuclear winter would save humanity and the arctic (by blocking out the sun)"

Science has always been my favorite subject.

I’ve also heard that fossil fuels aren’t limited that they belong in earth not burnt out. Something about making it seem limited allowed them to raise the prices."
"Litco","2020-01-30T08:15:58Z","The human impact on global warming is immensely overexaggerated and there were way higher temperatures on earth even before humans began to walk on it.
These theorists have for the last couple of years acted as terrorists and told humanity that the world is going down in a couple months and have been playing the same cards for years.
Instead of blindly looking at what others say, step outside and look for yourself. You'll find more than often that reality isn't as extreme as often told."

How can we attribute .01 degree changes to ""Human Caused Global Warming""
Most of so called warming occurs in the cities, No duh, take away tress replaced by concrete will do that.
The real lie is Global Warming just because I'm alive.
Warming believers want us all to go back to the stone ages when we died at 40 years of age.

I'm sorry all the research and scientific papers I have read espouse theories, none of which can be replicated in a real time real world physical experiment. They all rely on some digital algorithm that to date can not emulate nor replicate 100% of what goes on in our atmosphere. The best they can manage is around 5% of all factors that effect changes in weather/climate.

Climate inspires weather, but weather also inspires climate. Can't have either without the other.

Global warming/climate change is a move to redistribute money and steal from the poor, it's because of them California has 4$ gas while most other states are barely $2 a gallon.

This video wants you to believe climate is static and never changed before industrialization age. That is completely false.

Anyway, I had some spare time to waste. I know this won't change the believers of the church of global warming's minds, but like I said I had some time to waste."

They said glaciers were going to melt this year, they are still there.  The reason they call it Global Warming now is because their predictions have been wrong.  The link between CO2 and temperature change that was in synch actually is no longer in synch.  That is because the Sun is the biggest player when it comes to climate.  There are no humans, aliens (that we know of), or big oil companies causing massive climate change on other planets.  Science is not all in agreement and many site each other's work.  Many youtube channels and people just are repeaters including myself because I'm not a scientist.  But what I do know is the history I've lived in.

"Milan Hlaváček","2020-01-24T08:50:36Z","I think global warming needs to be researched more because it is really complicated, and there is more- like methane, unstable sun power output, and many more variables
My opinion is to go fully nuclear, start with fission and continue with fusion which is much cleaner, completely ban burning fossil fuels am instead use them to make other stuff like plastic, completely ban solar energy as it is highly inefficient an takes a lot of energy and work to proccess from minerals to final product and its lifespan is about 40 years and efficiency about 30% and they also occupy a lot of space that could be used for other purposes and also there needs to be DC-AC converter that can break down,

 wind turbines are basically same- high manufacturing price, resorce expensive and also require special cargo which also makes CO2, here livespan is better but still not great  and absolutely not main power source,

the last one is hydro, this one is propably best as it goes
'' high investment, high gain''
Its lifespan is much better and when its built it doesnt need much maitenance, power output more  stable than solar/wind , and yes they are most expensive to build but once you do its well worth it. 

Thanks for reading this essay, feel free to ask or even correct me. As i writing this i have flu and english is my second language so mistakes may be present. Anyway thats just a opinion a global warming opinion thanks for reading.

Yes we average humans are shitting up our planet, at a rate that  is having a very serious and servere effect on many different earth system. 
We have overloaded this planet with the refuse and debris of over consumption, and are poisoning it with industrial waste. This is not going to end soon. 
But the real culprit, the religion of ""Climate Change"" and the catchcry of sustainability is an evil plot against present and future generations. Pseudo science, hypo celebrity salespitches and alarmist propaganda sold the ignorant masses.
Sustainability is not gained through the willful, wanton destruction and sabatage of valuable property, land and communities, in order to build up something claimed to be better than what was there, enslaving countries in debit to do so.
Spraying our environment and skies with carcinogenic chemicals, the true cause of the catastrophic fires around the world of late, ie Australia, is nothing short of outright sabotage.

Now that I'm older, I have no idea what happened to the ozone layer, and what we did to make it better. The problem just seemed to vanish.

Sure, but that's not the point. We will be affected too (altough we probably won't go extinct that easily).

"Hosni Mubarak","2020-01-19T22:24:00Z","Time for a reality check. Changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun affects the amount of seasonal sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface. In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2 is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation."

Their apocalyptic predictions have been made for millennia, and, we’re still here. We will still be here long after they are dead and long gone 
I’ve studied the issue of Climate Change and Global Warming to the Nth degree.  Reems of it from both sides of the argument. I will not debate it any more. All I have to say is that I believe it is a load of nonsense and a corporate scam and the doom and gloomsters pumping out all this stuff are either severely misguided or have a vested interest in the other forms of energy supply. 
In the meantime, fossil fuels, coal especially are on the rise (check it out) and the major driving force of industry. To try to entirely do away with fossil fuels would need us going back to the stone age and it ain’t gonna happen because countries like China, USA and the Africa’s just will not stop using it

It is relatively successful in the world because 1.) it panders to the godless, atheistic, secular humanist-centered people who rather than worship God the Creator, worship nature and by extension, themselves, feeling they are able to indulge in all of their perverse decadence ( such as murdering millions of unborn babies yearly in the womb) while still feeling morally superior. So the very root of it is grounded in absolute hedonistic Satanic rebellion and hate against Christianity and God, led by the relatively small pyramid of power Satanist illuminati bloodline families who control central banks, media, entertainment and academia- they are currently being exposed by Trump the patriots and the worldwide info system Q  @   QMap.pub
2.) Most important for the cabal is that it builds the necessary preliminary scaffolding for global government by committing all nations to laws, regulations, penalties, fines, etc. starting out in this rather innocuous way in order to present itself as not only benign, but a necessary planet-saving strategy, but by design, it secretly becomes, year by year, ever more intrusive into the affairs of state governments until they have bore their way into all of them, thus securing control for this 1% vile, evil and despicable elite.
3.) In order to implement the plan described above in  2.), the Climate Change Hoax for Cabal control of the world, must be funded in order to pay off, bribe, extort, etc. the necessary stooges in governments, media, academia, etc. at all levels, all over the world, AND that is exactly what the Paris Accords afforded:  payments of millions and billions of dollars from taxpayers to fund this evil plan.
The sixteen year plan of an 8 year Obama/8 year Hillary strategy to achieve this Satanic New World Order, using in part the climate change hoax, has been disrupted by Trump and the Patriots and Q, an awakening movement that has spread worldwide. The Climate Change Hoax will be exposed as the evil lie that it is and  crimes of its evil leaders  such as Soros, Rothschild, Payseurs etc.  will be exposed to the world and Nuremburg -type trials will mete out justice."

And the same scientists in the 70s were predicting a possible ice age, not global warming. Get your history right and get the science right.
I encourage you to go read the seminal ""climate change denier"" study from which everyone quotes the 97% propaganda figure and learn for yourselves how they take facts and twist them into lies. They are the ""climate change deniers"" because they deny that natural climate change exists. Pay special attention to Tables 2 & 3 and Page 6 and you will see that only 8% of the studies explicitly endorsed the ""consensus"" view. About 75% of the studies the Cook authors counted as ""supporting the consensus view"" actually took NO position, but the Cook authors counted them anyway as ""implicitly"" supporting the fake ""consensus"" view. The Cook authors readily admit this in Tables 2 & 3 and Page 6. PLEASE do NOT believe me, go read it for yourselves and stop mindlessly parroting propaganda.

On this day in 1961: JFK reveals ‘weather control’ plans

n 1958, before Kennedy’s speech, the US military announced success in weather modification by sending powerful electromagnetic beams into the upper atmosphere, using ionospheric heaters similar to the ones used at the HAARPinstillation. The facility defines itself as “a scientific endeavour aimed at studying the properties and behaviour of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defence purposes.”

The HAARP technology has enormous capabilities for weather manipulation and its development was not prevented by the 1976 UN Weather Weapons Treaty – the Convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques. This defined weather weapons as “environmental modification techniques”, encompassing “any technique for changing – through the deliberate manipulation or natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the Earth.”


TERRAFORMING has begun: “Global dimming” is a plot to EXTERMINATE humanity by terraforming the atmosphere with SMOG pollution, killing Earth’s food crops and unleashing ecological collapse
“Stratospheric aerosol injection” now the new name for chemtrails / geoengineering
The global dimming scheme is, of course, based on spraying chemtrails into the upper atmosphere using thousands of high-altitude flights that release pollution to dim the sun.

The very idea of “chemtrails” has, until now, been mocked by the media and the science establishment, who have for years claimed the very idea of chemtrails is a lunatic conspiracy theory. So they’ve changed the name to “stratospheric aerosol injection,” and they now have a science paper that outlines all the costs involved.

"Steve Aitken","2019-12-22T13:31:05Z","I'm sorry but you're way too fixated on one aspect of this subject.  For starters CO2 is NOT A POLLUTANT, without at least 150ppm in the atmosphere, all plant life would die - and us along with it.  The latest version of the ""crisis"" cleverly refers to ""carbon"" in the atmosphere - which is a pollutant, but the whole ""debate"" has been about CO2.  And to correct you, carbon does not go into the atmosphere and bond with oxygen to form CO2, CO2 is produced in many ways - exhaling for example.  We don't exhale carbon, but CO2 - the same as plants do.  Fixate as you might on oil interests, but have a look at the annual ""climate change"" propaganda budget of the US in the past year, something like 4.6 BILLION dollars - and alarmists have the audacity to accuse many ""deniers"" of being funded by oil.  Get some perspective, look at the bigger picture - including the half-dozen or so attempts by the UN to run this same scam under different guises, then please start to think for yourself."

1.  If the paper counted implicitly did say something close to your example, that would be fair. But neither you nor I know that because the Cook study didn't include that data for us to decide. Many of the authors of many of those papers included as implicit have repudiated the Cook study for it. At least you admit there is plenty of room for bias and I think you gave them the benefit of the doubt without really knowing. In essence you took a religious leap of faith.


2.  Thanks, I will check out those studies you linked and I may update this if I see anything worth noting. Worth noting that you are the first person who's ever tried to actually cite studies that support AGW. Everyone else blindly parrots the 97% distortion.


3.  You are incorrect about the ""SEE!"" studies, esp about them going back over 100 years! Are you not aware that in the 70s, the ""consensus"" was that we were heading into a new ice age? I can link many articles showing this. Back then that was the hysteria. This has happened MANY times over the last 100 years - alarmist scientists claiming we're doomed, and they have all been wrong. And lately, rather than publicize any new such ""SEE!"" studies, people simply continue to parrot the 97% distortion, and the latest fad is to blame every new extreme weather event on global warming with zero scientific basis, and/or cherry pick data to claim extreme events are increasing.


4. I don't necessarily accept the literature that tells us the climate has been changing for millions of years on face value. I accept it because I can very easily internet search it and instantly see all the graphs of core samples and other proxies (agreeing) which tell us beyond any reasonable doubt that we've always had climate cycles going back millions of years. As you say, no one (except idiotic AGW proponents who are stupid) denies this. Things produced by AGW zealots on the other hand have been rife with fraud and scandals, including emails talking about smoothing out the medieval warming period and the last little ice age, and then you go and look at their graphs from the 80s and compare them to today and you see exactly that - massive fraud on changing the past historical temperature record. They claim, oh wait, we have better data now and our old data wasn't good. As a lawyer would say, so were you lying (aka exaggerating accuracy) back then, or now? Check out Tony Heller on YouTube to see vivid examples of this."

1. Not really what they're saying. the example _""‘. . . carbon sequestration in soil is important for
mitigating global climate change’"" should make this clear that it is indeed an implicit support for AGW. They have the exact same measuring stick for rejection. Now there is obviously a bias in selection. But it's the only way to do a meta study like this. I agree that we could use the numbers of implicit rejection/endorsement to make a new number, but my guess would be that it would clock in at about the same result. Feel free to come up with a study you feel is a fair comparison.


2. I was talking about meta studies like this, published in order to get a sense of consensus about this subject. Like i said, many have been done, and overwhelmingly show the same results.

The first papers on AGW are over a hundred years old by now, and they have been _trumpeting it to the masses and saying ""SEE!""_ ever since.

It has been demonstrated over and over again that AGW is real... Which is why i think it's fair to ask for papers that made you come to the opposite conclusion. _(3)_


4. It's a straw man to suggest that i don't think that climate hasn't always been changing, of course it has, we can see that in the scientific literature, in fact if you'd bothered to read it you would know that it's a huge part of AGW research. But that doesn't mean that humans can't influence climate change. Living organisms has done so in the past, and we're doing it right now. I find it funny that you accept all the literature that tell us that climate has been changing for millions of years, but reject all the literature that tells us AGW is a thing (especially because a lot of the literature is the exact same)"

1.  I already specifically cited, I'll do it again. Table 2 Item 3) shows them admitting they took it upon themselves to count papers that didn't endorse ""consensus"" as ""implicitly"" endorsing. Table 3 and page 6 gives the breakdowns (2/3 of papers took no position, of the 1/3 that Cook said did, 75% of those actually did not but again Cook counted them as ""implicit""). 

2.  Wrong! Don't you think if they had an actual scientific study that followed the scientific method that proved AGW, they would be trumpeting it to the masses and saying ""SEE!"". The fact is, they don't. You're wrong it's ""been confirmed"", because not only has NO scientific study proved AGW, but no subsequent study has confirmed what has not been scientifically proven. That's why you and other climate change cycle deniers always spew the 97% lie and distortion.

3.  I don't share studies that show AGW isn't real because that's not my job to disprove your theory of AGW. The truth is that humans are far far FAR away from being able to scientifically prove or disprove it. Why don't YOU cite studies that prove AGW? Not papers or opinions or polls, but actual studies. You can't, because they don't exist!

4. You don't seem to grasp that YOU are the ""Denier"". You don't even realize you've been duped into using Orwellian tactics where you call people like me ""deniers"" because we accept the scientific method and we accept the scientific fact of 100s of millions of years of climate change cycles as being real, while YOU deny this science fact and instead tout science junk and the _THEORY_ of AGW as if it was settled science. Also worth noting that there's something wrong with your arguments if you have to stoop to the Orwellian and downright religious zealot tactic of calling people who disagree with your crazy theories ""deniers"". There's something very wrong with that and I hope you will grow enough to start feeling shame for what you do."

2. In every peer reviewed meta study, which is a lot by now, shows figures in the exact same range, there is a consensus. And no, science is not determined by consensus, but the vast majority of evidence we have support AGW. And has been reconfirmed over and over again.

3. Why do we talk so much about this meta study? Why don’t you show the literature you think demonstrates that AGW is not real? 

4. There are plenty of deniers that think the globe isn’t warming, that it is warming but we can’t do anything about, people who think the globe is flat etc.. ... the common denominator is that they for some reason think all the science is fake (or in what little particular field they deem interesting) if you want to be called something else i’m open to suggestions."
"TIME'S UP","2020-01-07T22:09:59Z","@Væringjar The Cook study I linked to WAS the meta study of all studies (actually, papers, since no actual scientific study proves the _THEORY_ of AGW).

Again, don't believe me, go read the Cook study linked to...the one where people mindlessly quote the fake 97% figure.

""e.r.m. 
JazzBuff23 first of all, you are using the global warming Denver's talking points, and are seemingly unaware that these are among the weakest argument deniers have to offer. Secondly, you are making a strawman argument. No one is saying that C02 is a pollutant, you are arguing against it as though people are saying that. They are not. It is not being said that CO2 is a pollutant. Do you understand that? What is being said is that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Pollutants make the land, air, and sea dirty, it gives people lung problems and contaminates the water supply. Greenhouse gases on the other hand, makes things hotter. It's a different kind of problem. Do you seriously not realize that people know that C02 is plant food? And do you seriously think there's no limit to how much C02 plants need and that plant's capacity to absorb C02 is limitless? How is the expansion of deserts synonymous with the planet greening? Think about your arguments denying global warming instead of posting such basic and easy to refute stuff. ""


My answer: 

The EPA declared CO2 a pollutant.
""On Dec. 7 2009, as expectations grew for the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, EPA Administrator Lisa P Jackson signed an endangerment finding that asserted carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health when concentrated in the atmosphere. Now how does your argument stand up?"

Data collection was also corrupted by the NOAA using less data collection in Arctic areas and more in warm areas going so far as placing thermometers near AC compressors. The UN accepts this false science without question. They can profit from it and do- nothing people there are given something to do.

Told him it was the same price as the regular, had more octane, suppose to be cleaner and helps the farmers. He really didn't seem to like that.

Personally I believe that it is stupid to ruin the life of poor people without having any serious proof that climate change is caused by us and that it makes our lives worse. And besides that there isn’t really any good solution to stop climate change.

Some of the facts that I found during my research are:
- Climate change has always existed and it will keep doing so in the future.
- According to NASA: 90% of the ice worldwide is growing with 82-112 billion tons per year.
- Animal populations (like the polar bears and walruses) on the artics are thriving.
- There is no evidence that proves that there are more natural disasters.
- Scientists CANNOT connect natural disasters to climate change.
- Becoming a vegetarian/vegan is actually worse for the planet. This is because you are poisoning the land (top soil erosion).
- Energy poverty is quite a big problem (even in the western world) and will become an even bigger problem because of environmental taxes and more expensive energy sources.
- Paris climate agreement is just a joke (some countries do take it serious though) as a lot of countries are promising stuff they where already going to do or they promise even less than what they where planning. The only reason they sign is because they will get money out of it.
- CO2 is the food of life for plants.
- There is actually less CO2 in the atmosphere than before.
- CO2 cannot be connected to climate change if you look in history.
- Computer models are not precise and cannot be used to accurately predict the future.

So instead of these problems we should actually be looking at real problems that we can solve. One of the biggest is definitely the plastic soup, smog and deforestation.

*BTW I am all in for a better world but it should be based on facts and be good for all of us."

Except there’s just one problem: people, animal, and plants need the sun, which anyone who took elementary school science well knows.


“We lay out a future solar geoengineering deployment scenario of halving the increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing,” writes Wake Smith and Gernot Wagner in their paper, “Stratospheric aerosol injection tactics and costs in the first 15 years of deployment.” Published in Environmental Research Letters, you can view the full text of the study at this link.

Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere due to human action. It has interfered with the hydrological cycle by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas.
The global climate engineers are spraying unimaginable quantities of materials into skies all over the world as part of the ongoing geoengineering / solar radiation management assault. 


The world’s most recognized geoengineer, Dr. David Keith, has stated on the record a goal of putting 10,000,000 tons of aluminum nanoparticles into the atmosphere annually as part of the solar radiation management operations. Where could this much highly refined and specialized material come from? What company or corporation could have the capacity and global network to meet the demand of climate engineering operations all over the world? Who is at the head of such a company if it exists? Many of these answers may now have been found, this 11 minute video is a short exposé of the American Elements Corporation and it’s CEO.

Actually, I would use that definition too, but it doesn't really matter as long you don't confuse the two.

There is a reason why they keep saying highest CO2 concentration since 4m years while earth is 4.5b years old and multicellular  life is atleast 900m years old. Both sides are biased towards this issue, one claims that this is not real and another claims that this is an existential crisis. Neither is true. Untill we start having honest discussion, nothing is going to be solved. We need to reduce our emissions but nowhere I saw an honest discussion on how important fossil fuels is in our lives. Fossil fuels aka cheap reliable energy is the primary reason there are about 7.5b of us. Without it modern society, lifestyle, healthcare wouldn't exists. We should have a discussion about pros and cons of discontinuing fossil fuels as a primary fuel source. And believe me there are lots of cons. No for of renewables (apart from hydropower) could provide a cheap reliable baseload power. The cost of electricity in California is 300% per MWh more than any heartland states like Kentucky. And even if developed economies did manage to reduce their emissions dramatically developing countries cannot. Coal for the foreseeable future will be primary source of energy especially in Asian economies like India and China."

"Mikey Strikey","2019-12-09T23:49:06Z","@Siyi Szeto Again, nothing of substance. You talk about ""predictions"" that were never ever made. The only prediction scientists made was that by 2050 the temps would be 1 deg hotter, and by 2100 2-4 degree hotter. Well we know that 4 deg hotter ( or even 2 degree hotter)  will mean the end of life as we know it, so how do we know this will happen? Well we dont know for sure, but given their first prediction came true 30 years faster than expected, then surely we can surmise the latter will come true IF we fail to act now. Not next year... NOW!


Back in 1970 or thereabouts, it was publicly announced by scientific research by scientists (in the Antarctic I recollect) that Australian southern states will soon be getting the same temps as the northern states. This is another prediction by Australian scientists at least, that has come true.


Now comes the ""snowball effect"" into play. With droughts and higher temps come the bushfires unlike we ever seen before. Ask any eastern Australian... this is not scare mongering. At the moment as I speak there are over 100 bush fires present down the east coast of Australia. I actually got caught driving through one at Batemans Bay a week ago. Sydney is currently experiencing was is now termed a ""Mega fire"".   These fires will only get worse in years to come... no prediction needed as blind Freddie can see that. What this will do is... INCREASE the rate of warming (snowball effect) to where further catastrophes will occur and again increasing the rate of warming for even more and worse catastrophes. Are you with me so far? Its not science anymore... Its common simple understanding is all. Children understand it, so why so many old farts not get it?


When the earth gets too hot and more water is evaporated saturating the atmosphere, this will lead to earth cooling... just like it has already done many times in the past. The only problem will be then, life will be extinct of humans, unless for a miracle from the Creator, in whom I believe. This planet is a gift from Him, and so we should treasure it instead of abuse it. There will come a time when every soul must face their Creator... even if they believe He is not real.


If you have any prediction that Science made of the end of this world PRIOR to this present day, I would love to see it, and if true, I would laugh me head off at such an idiot to predict such a thing. To my knowledge, I do not so far know of such an idiot."

And that is the maximum we will get, in fact water vapour occupies part of that absorption spectrum already, so it is less than this.  4 to 5 C requires  a water vapour increase acting as a positive feedback.  That isnt happening, look at NASA NVAP data, zero water vapour increase. 

Since the effect is inverse log we have already had, according to LIndzen, 80% of that warming for the 45%  more CO2 we added. So there isnt much left to come when we get to 540 ppm.

Sea level rise?  It has been doing that for 7000 years. 

And there is zero increase in hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, fires extreme rainfall etc at all.  In fact GW might well reduce storminess by reducing the latitudinal temperature gradient. 

Face facts, CO2 is causing mild warming and a big increase in plant growth."

I will concede that we did need to rely on fossil fuels to get where we are now, but the time has come where we can get away from them.

You can say fresh, new, free - range, but law forbids to write ""healthy eggs"" because it's scientificly proven that eggs are not nutritious. Your food have to be fruit, vegetable. Fruit is giving you lust for squezzing juice, vegetable is grounded (eat me, but not to much like carrots), when animal runs from you. There was a time when only elite could afford or lawly granted to consume so."

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:

Period of Record
417,160 - 2,342 years BP

Methods
In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).

Trends
There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

"Twinkler Mystik","2019-11-07T15:37:06Z","Something else you might find interesting.  Thirty years ago, a man stumbled onto a little bit of technology that demonstrated a 2,000% improvement in energy efficiency.  A piece of electrical equipment that normally drew 120 Amperes was fully operational while only drawing 6 Amperes, by adding one simple piece.  While it was not ""shelved"", the full potential was also not explored.  It was released to industry with limitations that did not make it as attractive as it might have been.


In fact, 2,000% is not the limit.  It does not use wind, water, or heat.  It has no emissions, and no radiation hazard.  It can replace coal-fired and petroleum-fired power plants.  It can replace nuclear plants.  It can power an aircraft carrier around the world with no radiation hazard.  It's not perpetual motion because if the frequency source goes down, the system goes down. 



Power plants using fossil fuels are a significant source of greenhouse gasses, and if you thought nuclear energy was clean and worry free, think again.  It does not stop with Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima.  Some thirty years ago, a Russian nuclear-powered sub sank in the Baltic Sea.  Today, that power plant is leaking serious radiation into the sea.  We don't need a nuclear war.  Any war that sinks a few nuclear ships around the world has the potential to destroy part of our food chain.


The discoverer of that little piece of technology was given no credit (in violation of federal patent laws), the company took it over, and engineering rejects the additional capabilities.  Even more, the very scientists that give us these dire warnings of climate change show absolutely no interest in the technology.  That reduces their credibility considerably.  If the situation was that serious, they should be looking at any and all possible alternatives."

Oh, and desertification due to heat? The plants can stand the humid heat we’d perish under, the real issue is that carbon levels are declining on a timescale of millions of years. Guess what happens when all green matter becomes starved for food. Hint, we die with them.

At the end of the last ice age, less than 12k years ago, sea levels rose 430 feet as the ice that had buried Manhattan up to 2 miles deep receded. Scientists aren't even sure what causes ice ages. It's impossible to know how much we have had to do with any changes. Co2 has risen a tiny bit and they told you to panic about that, but it's probably the main cause of the explosion of green growth over the last 35 years. 2.2 million sq km of new forest growth, even counting the area lost to deforestation. Anyway we're still at the very very bottom of the scale for co2 in the history of planet earth. It's risen 30% or whatever in a 100 years, but it could double again and we'd still be at the bottom.


The whole thing is just a political scam. The climate is constantly changing, it goes in cycles we don't even fully understand. In 1975 they said we were doomed to a new ice age, that was the panic of the day for a decade or so. Then it was called global warming, that was new scare word. Then the warming stopped in the early 2000s- look up the climategate emails on any search engine not run by google- and they had to rebrand it ""climate change"". The ""consensus"" thing is totally bogus, it all comes from a couple scammer blogs lying in a ""study"" that they'd surveyed all these papers, which at even a glance you can see it's just bogus. Obama repeated it in a speech and it became dogma, scientific consensus blah blah, lol. It was never true.

"Bit & Rudder","2019-10-23T17:30:25Z","There’s a problem at the very beginning. There’s one world, one climate, one environment: there was absolutely no control group to rule out other causes of the findings. Second problem: the climate has changed continually for as long as we have been alive, and with what scientific tools are available to us, it appears to have been going on like that for a long time. In addition to this fact being an uncontrollable variable, it asked the question “should we be messing with the weather?.“ And that is completely aside from the fact that our ability to control the weather is a whole other variable. Who is to say that the weather modification activities that have been going on for years have not skewed results? Add to that the fact that leaders like George Bush and Kissinger etc. have been quoted as saying, or have written, That in pursuit of a one world government they need a problem big enough to draw everyone together and that climate is a great tool for that. Now you need to separate “science” with flat out human manipulation, greed etc. Then we can move a little further into the fact that there is a large body of scientists who do not agree, and who explain very clearly how the “consensus statistics” were manipulated, and how they do not dare to speak out until after retirement because they actually need to feed their families.  If the world is heating up, regardless of the cause, it seems as though we simply post the public service announcement and suggest that people crops that can tolerate more extreme weather changes, and consider selling your property if you are at a low elevation. And let people take responsibility for their decisions. That is a little glib, but I hope you get my point. Instead of promoting solutions being generated by people at the top, just let people know that it’s open season on solutions to the changes that are possibly coming. Oh, yes. There is that niggling little issue… We can’t even accurately predict the weather next week, much less next month, next year, in 12 years. But wait, there’s more: It would be nice if the people who are doing the weather manipulation would cease and desist so we can see what the weather is actually supposed to be. So far, the only thing being offered to us is shaming for questioning, and higher taxes to pay for… What, exactly?  And it’s not like using LED bulbs and Tesla cars are actually good for your health in the short one or the long run. But there are plenty of people who would like to lobby for legislation that gives them incentives to create “green“ options that may, but probably will not, “fix” the perceived problem. At our expense. So, you presented a very rational sounding video but you are missing the boat on Key pieces of the story."

"Alan-in-Bama","2019-10-11T17:51:19Z","But let me point out a few Very ODD coincidences & hypocrisies that just don’t make any sense !  

Well, they do, because they All come back to MONEY!  But let’s review anyway...

1) In your video you stated a logical point,  that - with the increase of global temperatures would bring an equal increase in the amount of rainfall... which is good, but you stated it would only fall in rainforest areas- and other areas would become desert.  
  Yes, rainfall would definitely increase, but no one....not you, meteorologists or climate scientists can predict WHERE rain will fall years into the future !
  It may very well bring rainfall to areas that are now desert and therefore create enormous amounts of new habitat for farming, wildlife and human living!

2) If the polar caps melted away a large percentage, it wouldn’t simply increase sea levels and destroy coastlines..... the warmer atmosphere will naturally create Much More water evaporation, which then creates More clouds and rainfall.  Yet, another benefit for more habitat !!

3) CO2 is made out to be such an enemy of nature and the climate at large... but CO2 is the life source for All plants and trees.  After photosynthesis, plants and trees would naturally expel increased levels of Oxygen.... that’s Another benefit to every mammal on Earth, since we breathe and survive with Oxygen !  😁

4) Every celebrity and politician that travels around doing speeches on the ‘Severe Crisis’of climate change.... also uses vehicles like automobiles, airplanes, etc , that burn fossil fuels and only contribute more to the problem they SAY they’re fighting against !??
  Also - I’ve yet to see any of them OR their supporters lead by example and discard All forms of travel that use fossil fuels... or discard all the products including plastics or synthetic rubber, etc, etc.... because those are All petroleum-based products !!??


5)Almost All Scientists that are onboard the consensus of Man-made climate change are also Funded by governments through grants, etc...  A large majority of Scientists Not funded by government OR Oil companies are Not in agreement with that consensus or the cause and need for fear !???

  I wonder.... are these government funded studies in Fear of losing those Large sums of Money handed out by the government ?? 🤔🤔


Now - I’m not calling anyone out or trying to create an argument.... I simply prefer to know the Facts and to use objective, logical reasoning instead of accepting what is being forced on me to believe.

—> All of the points I just listed have been made by multiple, Independent Climate scientists, NOT funded by governments or petroleum companies !"

"Dr. Van Nostrand","2019-10-09T00:25:38Z","I 100% agree that climate change is the #1 reason for which we should invest in renewables and  divest from fossil fuels, HOWEVER, we need to be smarter about how we go about achieving that! The conservatives (whose support we need whether we like it or not) all over the world have proven they don't care about the science and will never support investment in renewables solely for the sake of addressing climate change, THEREFORE, we need to stop wasting our resources fighting on an unwinnable front and come at the problem from a different angle!


NEW STRATEGY TO WIN OVER SUPPORT OF THE CONSERVATIVES: Independence from the Middle East (particularly Saudi Arabia).


If we weren't dependent on oil coming from the Middle East - 


1. The bombing of Saudi Arabia's oil refineries would NOT have forced the US and everyone else to consider using their strategic oil reserves
2. Without people buying their oil they wouldn't have nearly as much money to funnel into the mosques and spread their extremist version of Islam
3. The US and its allies wouldn't have any need to put ships and military personnel into the Strait of Hormuz to protect the flow of oil out of the Middle East
4. We likely wouldn't need to be as concerned with the affairs of Middle-Eastern countries, thus allowing the US and its allies to withdraw their forces from that region. This in turn would reduce (essentially eliminate) the risk of terrorist attacks in the West (Islamic terrorists' primary justification is - ""the West is killing our innocent civilians, so we're going to do the same to them"").


IN SUMMARY: Despite the importance of addressing climate change, ultimately what we want is more investment in renewables and less investment in fossil fuels. The conservatives are all that's standing in our way, therefore our primary focus should be on winning their support. We will definitely not win their support solely on the issue of climate change, however, for the sake of independence from the Middle East we might have half a chance."
"dinadangdong","2019-10-08T21:03:15Z","What is the point of this video? You believe man is responsible for Climate Change? Pretty obvious. This is a one heluva bias ""cherry picking"" story.
Now if you were honest, you would also explain to people that more CO2 is produced by the oceans than all other sources combined (by the proverbial mile). And that IS fact. So comparing the burning of fossil fuels by humans may well be the same as comparing a guy (or girl) farting in the corner of a music hall, resulting in the whole building collapsing.

They say we have less than ten years and we have to destroy all our homes to rebuild, and of course people have to have a place to living the mean time, so they will have to build dormitories first. People will have about 150 (5x5x6) cubic feet of their own space, barely high enough to stand up and only wide enough for a bed and a couple drawer/lockers.

Then people will not be able to drive to their work, so each area will have to have jobs near by that they can reach easy enough in a reasonable time, mostly walking, since vehicles will cost too much. For some that will not be too bad since they want to build the building in such a manner that most of the plants producing their food is grown on the outside of the dorms. In fact, since you will not be able to use machinery to farm the plants, it will all be done by manual labor and that will take up a lot of the people living there.

Since meat production creates so much co2, they will have to be limited and most of the ""meat"" you get will be vegetable fakes.

Most jobs produce too much co2, so they will be shut down and people will live off what the government gives them."

2) Take over the media and only report what is good for the agenda (check)
There were several more steps but two of the last steps was to get many socialist into congress (the squad) and elect a president that they could control (Obama and Hillary). Because Hillary was the second Clinton and its obvious that Chelsea was being groomed to be next, they were suppose to be the first dynasty of the socialist age of America.

They were also suppose to be the last as soon they were suppose to put in effects laws that would soon turn over control to the UN. Borders were suppose to be removed and most of American would be from other countries."

2) They want to take away your cars.
3) they want to rebuild homes and tell you where you have to live4) they want to tell you what kind of work you can do.
5) they want to limit the number of children you can have. They have even said that some segments of society should not have children.

I can go on but if you look at this, they want you to be dependent on the government so that you have to agree to everything they tell you is good for you.

In order for more plants we would also require a rise in sunlight amd water for the plants to perform photosynthesis. Because we are not seeing that though, we just have lots of excess CO2 in the atmosphere trapping infrared lights and heat in the atmosphere causing the global temperatures to rise. Droughts are when we are out of fresh or clean water, water from rising sea levels is salt water that would have to go through changes by machines that are still in their infancy to become pure. Also, the argument that scientists thought there would be an ice age in the 70's is wrong. 5 times as many studies supported global warming.

"robert hicks","2020-06-02T17:12:04Z","@Karl Wheatley ""You're operating based on myths created by the global network of AGW denier groups"" No, I am basing it on facts. 
1) the consensus fallacy was created by PROFESSOR Cook, a teacher of political communication, i.e. political spin. Not only is this guy an expert at spinning lies into things that sound like the truth, he teaches it. Cook admitted the purpose of creating the ""consensus"" was to convince people to elect officials that would vote to give away american tax money to other countries.
2) The hockey stick graph was created by three people, a physicist, an expert in tree rings, and a political scientist.
3) Alarmist refuse to follow standard scientific procedures every other field follows.
All of your science comes from people that are hard core socialist who want to take america's tax money and give it to other countries. Im sure taking a lot of money from the EU would not hurt the scheme either.
The biggest problem you have is that the majority of your sponsorship comes from china. Every bit of the ""green"" energy comes from things they control. So what you are doing is helping china take over the world. THAT is why I will always fight you."
"Karl Wheatley","2020-06-02T14:24:16Z","@robert hicks Thanks for your reply. ""IF you want to believe political scientist more than real scientist, go ahead."" You're operating based on myths created by the global network of AGW denier groups so you've got it backwards: What I said all comes straight from the SCIENCE itself whereas the things you said come from the Exxon/Koch Brothers-funded global warming denier propaganda. That's why every single point you made was scientifically incorrect. You got climate sensitivity to CO2 off by a factor of 4.
Got work to do now, but I'll address your individual points later. But did you even look at the links I sent? They prove that climate models going back decades have predicted global warming very accurately. So the myths from AGW propaganda that you are regurgitating about the climate models supposedly not being very accurate have already been decisively disproven. 
Take care."
"robert hicks","2020-06-02T11:52:33Z","@Karl Wheatley IF you want to believe political scientist more than real scientist, go ahead. It doesn't make it right. There is no evidence we should be cooling and if you look at the graph of co2 and the graph of temperature changes, they do not match.
A sensitivity of 3° should result in a temperature increase of at least 1.5° with a half double.  Since the co2 has increased by over 50%, temperature should be a minimum of 1.5° but it isnt. UNLESS the sensitivity is at least 3°c there is no risk to the future.
But lets look at this suppose correlation.
From the 1650 to 1675 co2 did not move, but temperature rose a half degree.
Then the industrial revolution started. How did the warming caused by co2 happen before the revolution began? then co2 barely changed from 1700 to the 1850's yet temperature climbed and fell. IF co2 is the cause of the warming how did it rise and fall 3 times in that period? From 1950 to 1880 it fell causing the ""scientist"" to predict a new ice age. BUT it started warming in 1910 and continued until 1938, with the co2 barely changing. Then co2 started rising and the temperature fell slightly  from 1938 to 1975. For a time they both rose rapidly (note the rise in co2 started in 1950's) from 1975 to 2005. Since 2005, there has hardly been any rise, despite the fact that co2 has increased rapidly. 
There is no connection between co2 rise and temperature changes.
IF you choose to ignore reality, thats your business, but the truth is, there is no model that the mid line comes close to reality. Political scientist will tell you its all man made, but reality is far from their claims.
""We have ALREADY passed the point where it will cost us FAR more not to act than it will cost us to take massive and decisive action to transform our economy and lifestyles and get these monsters under control."" This is in reality what its all about, giving them total control over our lives, allowing them to decide what kind of food we can eat, what kind of job we can have,  what kind of living condition, IF and WHEN we can have children or get married, what kind of religion we are allowed, all of it to stop a threat we can never see."
"Karl Wheatley","2020-06-02T04:19:22Z","@robert hicks Thanks so much for your reply. No, the warming is NOT in line with models that leave out CO2 because as tons of research shows, regardless of the time period you pick, almost all, all, or more than 100% of recent global warming is due to human activity. The chart at Wikipedia captures it simply but well. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming
""Something you might not be aware of is that they do not give a precise temperature predictions, as that would be insane.""
Actually, some models gave a straight-lime prediction and some give a range but with a central average line indicated.
""They do not know how sensitive the atmosphere is to co2 changes so the have a wide range of possibilities."" Your information is decades out of date. Hansen had a model back in the 1970s that was based on an overestimated sensitivity of the climate to more CO2, so it overestimated warming, but since the early 198os, numerous models have quite accurately predicted how much warming will come from more CO2. 

https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/climate-models-have-accurately-predicted-global-heating-study-finds

""Any model that say the atmosphere is greater than .5°c per doubling is off in a matter of years."" That incorrect again. We've only  increased atmospheric CO2 by 50% but doing that increased global temps 1 degree C. So the real-world effect is FOUR TIMES greater than what you just claimed (and the effect would keep increasing for awhile due to feedback loops even if we didn't  add any more CO2). 

"" Every prediction that requires us to spend a lot of money involves a warming of at least 2.5°c per doubling of co2."" 
Again, what you are saying is totally out of line with the science and economics of this. We have ALREADY passed the point where it will cost us FAR more not to act than it will cost us to take massive and decisive action to transform our economy and lifestyles and get these monsters under control. We are talking hundreds of trillions in damages if we don't turn society around--which is a fancy way of saying ecosystems will collapse and our food supply, society, and population will collapse if we don't transform our society. Industrialized capitalism and our consumerist lifestyles are so laughably out of line with the laws of nature that if there is some alien race watching us, they are just sitting there eating their popcorn and saying to each other ""I can't believe how dumb those humans are. Don't they know they are driving their civilization off of a cliff?"" 

""The reality is, the ones that say there will be a disaster are not in line with reality."" Again, what you are saying is the absolute opposite of reality. We have already had climate-fueled disasters that have costs us many billions of dollars. We are on track for all or almost all coral reefs to be gone by 2100, for 5 feet of sea level rise by then, for a good chunk of the global wheat crop to be gone by then and for the lands that about 3.5 billion people live in to have unbearable heat waves by 50 years from now (with them already starting in some places). And beyond global warming and ocean acidification, our actions may collapse the web of life through simple pollution, microplastics, or resource wars."
"robert hicks","2020-06-01T19:36:38Z","@Karl Wheatley It is also right in line of the climate models that say co2 is not a factor. The reality is, the ones that say there will be a disaster are not in line with reality.
Something you might not be aware of is that they do not give a precise temperature predictions, as that would be insane.  What they do is give a range. The middle of the road MIGHT give a slight risk of a disaster, but the reality is more in line with the lowest predictions. They do not know how sensitive the atmosphere is to co2 changes so the have a wide range of possibilities. Their range usually goes something like .5°c to 5°c change per doubling. Any model that say the atmosphere is greater than .5°c per doubling is off in a matter of years. Any thing with a sensitivity of less than 3° can not predict a risk to humanity or other species. Every prediction that requires us to spend a lot of money involves a warming of at least 2.5°c per doubling of co2."
"robert hicks","2019-10-20T15:15:13Z","1) How do you know there is a consensus? Because a socialist group produced a fake report and made that claim.
2) What does consensus matter in science. Consensus is a political term that is only used in POLITICAL science.
3) the +1°C is above the temperature it was in the LITTLE ICE AGE. The earth lost 2-3°c in a couple centuries and you think it was normal? No, that was not the normal temperature, it was due earth being unusual cold and now we are recovering from that."

The possibility of the Earth overheating due to the atmosphere holding irradiated heat was also being considered because scientist were then unaware of the logarithmic nature of an increase in temperature, rather than a linear increase in temperature, as the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased."
"Karl Wheatley","2019-10-21T21:03:52Z","@wegtamwanderweg Great question, and thanks for the reply. CHANGES in CO2 and CHANGES is temp have been correlated, but CO2 isn't the only factor driving temps, so when those other factors are changing (e.g., sun) you can get higher CO2 and lower temps.


https://skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past.htm


IN recent history, the sun's output has been quite stable (declining a tiny bit actually), and other natural influences have been ruled out (e.g., orbit), so we know it's all the CO2 we've added that is not just the main driver of recent change but almost the only driver.

"Karl Wheatley","2019-10-21T05:08:01Z","More recent research has shown that yes, CO2 HAS preceded warming. It's a feedback loop: More CO2 cause more warming which then releases more CO2 which causes even more warming and so on."

The earth has about 14 different tilts and pulls on it causing it to shift and change throught its movement in space (because ya know theres cycles of time in space us humans with lifespans of barely a century will never comprehend) in the early 19th century we literally came out of an ice age. Oh wait and what did those climate scientists say back in 2017? That's right the world is getting cooler not hotter and we should be worried about another ice age. The ice caps aren't melting to drown us all. They were at their largest point since the ice age of 12000 years ago, in 1819 . So yes, theyre melting some. That's the science they want to show you. Take a look a the big picture and think for yourself."

This why you can't find any evidence in history of warming after an increase of C02 level.  A perfect example is the previous heat wave of the 1930's, the Heat was as much as it has been in the recent heat waves, yet there were far less people, much less Industrialization and therefore far less C02 in the atmosphere.  How can that be if C02 is the driver higher temperatures?"

The latent heat retention from the long wave radiation does not combine with the CO2 “back radiation”. That is absurd. Heat travels in one direction—where it is cold. The heat escapes into space. There is no additional effect that is caused by additional CO2 in the atmosphere.

"Karl Wheatley","2019-12-11T17:18:53Z","@J. Milton Jeffreys Thanks for your reply. 
That's a really important point--unless we solve that challenge there will be hell to pay. To save Earth's ecosystems and keep the Earth livable for humanity in the long run, people have to stop doing what is most familiar and convenient for them to do and they need to make actual sacrifices. As the bumper sticker of an old Marine in our town says ""Freedom Isn't Free"" and keeping Earth livable also won't be free, but most of us  have been programmed to be self-indulgent consumers, not guardians of each other or the Earth. So, the challenge IS enormous, and it's made harder because the human mind isn't very good at dealing with long-term threats.  


Happily, as more people start realizing the nature of the threat, many will leap into action motivated by some combination of love for life and by fear and moral obligation. I'm betting that hundreds of millions of people are already taking small steps--consuming less, driving a little bit less, turning down the thermostat in winter, flying less (this is apparently a measurable trend in Sweden), eating less meat, etc. And the climate strike on September 20th was tied for the largest global protest in history. Lots of young people look at the world we older boomers gave them, and they are horrified and scared, so more of them will keep leaping into action and they will shame some others into action. For it to be fast enough to dodge 2 degree C warming, we need the trend to go viral, and need to override the greedy short-term impulses of fossil fuel companies and many billionaires. It's a heavy lift, but either we do that or Earth's ecosystems will continue to be degraded and collapse, and then our food supply, civilization, and population would collapse.  Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for cooling the Earth and healing its ecosystems, but it will take a revolution in how we think and live. 


Take care."
"Karl Wheatley","2019-11-28T02:13:30Z","@salty dog Thanks for the reply.
""buddy if by research you mean you've been reading the NYT, I've got some really bad news for you...Think harder Karl. Come up for air. The earth is not dying.""

Unfortunately I'm a PhD university researcher and for more than a decade, I've been researching and writing a book about how the health of society and the planet are beginning to unravel, and what we need to do to heal them. I've read thousands of things about the problems, and they are real, lethal, and urgent. 

Yes, there HAVE been various nutjobs throughout history saying the end is near, and the media loves making trumped up stories out of outlier scientists who claim an ice age is coming or Y2K is a huge threat. But there have been NO prior instances when such a large collection of the world's top scientists have been issuing warnings to civilization saying that our way of life threatens the future of planetary life and that time is running out to make big changes before we set in motion catastrophic. 

Sorry, but this time is different, and it is different because instead of NATURAL up-and-down cycles, UNNATURAL human activity is STEADILY and relentlessly destroying the web of life. And instead of isolated religious nuts or a few isolated scientists, huge percentages of scientists from many disciplines are reporting how we are destroying the web of life. And how are we destroying it? 


Beyond burning fossil fuels, look around your home or apartment: The mining/logging, transport, manufacture, transport, lifespan, and disposal of virtually every man-made object you own caused net harm to the web of life. What happens when you keep harming living things more and more every day, as humans are doing? They start to get sick, decline in numbers, or go extinct. This is already happening, with human activity having already killed off the majority of most major species and smaller/less easily quantified species have also seen massive declines. But what humans have forgotten is that our economy, civilization, and very lives are totally dependent on that web of life we are killing off. 


Wanna' know ALL the effects more CO2 and the related warming cause? As I taught one of my university classes recently, the long-term harmful effects of rapidly adding much  more CO2 include global warming of the land, atmosphere, and especially oceans; rapid and accelerating melting of the Earth’s ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels (very slow at first but increasingly catastrophic), growing shortages of freshwater for drinking and irrigation affecting billions of people, more intense droughts, floods, and wildfires; and more air pollution and related human health problems due to more intense forest fires.  

The overly-optimistic folks who claim that global greening from more CO2 apparently don’t know that with the greening, weeds tend to really benefit, and with the warming you get more harm to crops and forests from insects, fungi, and disease; grain crops have already lost 5-8% or more of key nutrients due to more CO2 and will continue to lose more, and the amount of sugars in grain crops will continue to rise. Lower nutrient content and higher sugar content in our foods just feeds the crisis of obesity and related diseases, driving up health care costs further. Also, more CO2 means plants will grow thicker leaves and need more water due to increased CO2 (this will intensify water shortages as 70-80% of freshwater is used for agriculture/food production). The more intense droughts and floods creates problems for many farmers, and the range where certain crops can be grown efficiently has moved towards the poles by 100 miles or more already: Unfortunately, there is less land near the poles than in the fatter middle of the Earth, and the land up there often hasn’t had time or opportunity (permafrost) to develop really rich topsoil. Thus, while more CO2 can increase crop growth at first, as warming and all the other ripple effects kick in, crops get more stressed and struggle: Thus, a recent study expects 60% of the global wheat crop to be threatened by 2100. 

More CO2 and the warming it causes also means the spread of human disease as the “tropics” and its mosquito-borne diseases expand by 30 miles a decade, while melting permafrost has unleashed other diseases long-frozen in the ice (e.g., anthrax). 

Then there’s the warming-caused mass die-offs of coral reefs and the fish and other aquatic life that depend on them, the increasing drying of America from west to east, the slowing of ocean currents with ripple effects for climate (already beginning) and increasing the size of dead zones in the ocean, the collapse of ecosystems on land (permafrost region, drying of the Amazon) and sea (decline/collapse of coral reefs and fish populations, polar ecosystem heading for collapse as “cold-enough” areas disappear), sea snails at the bottom of the food chain having their shells dissolve at much higher rates because of the more acidic oceans, other shellfish having a harder time building shells, and thus being 30-50% smaller than normal), almost all green sea turtles are now being born female (because gender is regulated by the temperature of the sand at that time of year). 

More CO2 rapid die-offs of species related to the above—including the disappearance of 40% of the plankton population since the 1950s, increasing crop failures due to the above, increasingly-worsening refugees crises due to the above, increasingly staggering mitigation and repair costs due to the above, and increasing political and social instability and violence and resource conflicts/wars (already happening) due to all of the above. The chain reactions are vastly worse than you have ever been told—truly catastrophic in the long run, leading (if we don’t take rapid action) to the collapse of ecosystems, our food supply, and our civilization and population. I don’t know, but I do know that very few scientists know all of these destructively cascading ripple effects because most don’t read much outside of their specialty. P.S. I didn’t even include all of those ripple effects.

So, if you are watching videos and reading on websites that “Hey, more CO2 is great—it’s plant food,” I want to know why aren’t these folks aren’t telling you the WHOLE story? Why are they only telling you about 1% of the changes rapidly increasing CO2 levels will cause, and leaving out the other 99%.  Is it because they don’t know the whole story? That may be  understandable—I only know all this because I’ve been researching for more than 10 years on a book about what we need to do to protect and heal society and the planet. However, some of these harms have been well-publicized, so if these people are scientifically literate, they should know about them. Another possibility regarding some of the site/sources that gleefully declare “CO2 is plant food!” is that they are PAID to spread propaganda like pretending more CO2 is all good news. After all, the fossil fuel companies and some billionaires like the Koch Brothers have been spending a combined $200+ million a year to spread propaganda to confuse people, and they may have funded the folks that provided some of the information you heard. 

Take care."

uhoh what? No one was talking about monsoons--which are different from hurricanes. It's known that making the air temperature 1 degree warmer means it holds around 7 percent more moisture, so ON TOP OF any natural cycles, us adding more CO2 to the atmosphere has made storms, hurricanes, and floods more intense and destructive . Simultaneously, because the air holds more moisture, global warming is drying out many areas and making droughts worse.

""so what do you propose to do about it?""
In a broad sense, we have to bring our economy and way of life in line with the laws and limits of nature. You know, like living within the family budget, but here it's the Earth budget. The books Doughnut Economics and Enough is Enough give more details of what we need to do. For reducing the amount of CO2 in the air and cooling the planet back down a tad, reducing energy and material consumption are critical, and here's a list of well-researched strategy for ""drawdown,"" with the carbon savings of each:

It is proven out of all the renewable wind and tidal energy are the most unproductive due to requiring a force that is solely unreliable. Either the wind blows or it doesn't. Those wind turbines are not going to produce anything if the wind is not there. Even windy places have periods of stillness. Until renewables have improved no one will be interested in using them when you have better cheaper yields from gas and coal. Then on top of that few places are even prime for permanent renewables like solar. As much as I am not fond of nuclear power that is the only one with any reliability in terms of power output. Apart from geothermal solar has more promise, but even then you have 12 hours of down time that needs to be covered."

If you're talking about a single place, your point completely ignores the point that you're replying to.
How often do you see a weather forecast predicting no wind anywhere in the country?
Sensible use of wind power uses many locations, and is prepared for the wind to be too weak (or too strong) in some them at any time (different places at different times).

In the short/medium term, there would be still be significant fossil fuel generators (e.g. gas combustion turbines for their short start-up time) to cope with temporary shortfalls. In the longer term, renewable technologies will have improved."

You get better reliance on solar but the technology is still shit. Sure you can slap a few pannels on the roof and it might help, yet you still need fossil fuels or conceed and go the nuclear route.

"John Bernard Lambe","2019-12-17T13:44:05Z","Some of them do (not geothermal; weather generally doesn't interrupt hydro output), but there is always wind blowing somewhere, and sufficient sunlight somewhere except at night when power demand is lower. For the next few decades, a small proportion of non-green power could provide for temporary shortfalls in renewable output (if the rest of the grid was replaced with renewables).

With all due respect, I believe you are not looking at the big picture and how all the parts of the system interact. Yes, in a controlled experiment in a greenhouse, more CO2 gets you more plant growth. That part you have right. But that experiment doesn't reflect the real-world ripple effects of global increases in CO2, meaning those experiments are useless for guiding policy. So how do natural systems actually work? In the real world, increased CO2 is causing global warming which in turn causes the atmosphere to hold more water (7% more for every 1 degree C increase in temperature), which is leading to the drying out of ecosystems--for example, across the American west. The combination of warming and drier soils than has allowed for things like the beetle infestations in the Rockies. The combination of these factors has led to staggering die offs of forests, for example, 
>800 million ""standing dead"" trees in Colorado alone. This increase in dead trees makes forest fires worse, releasing even more CO2 into the atmosphere, thus causing even more warming and an acceleration of this kind of destruction. The dried out ground also releases more CO2, and the whole cycle leads to epic storms, floods, and droughts. Meanwhile, the warming has already made crops such as grains to have 5-8% less of key nutrients, thus promoting poor human health, overeating, or both. More broadly, pumping most of that heat and EXCESS CO2 human pumped into the atmosphere was absorbed by the oceans, making them warmer and 30% more acidic. Marine life isn't designed for these rapid changes in their ecosystem, and the last time the Earth warmed this rapidly, >90% of life in the oceans went extinct. THAT is where our reckless disruption of ecosystem balance is taking us: For example, half of the largest living thing on Earth--the 2400 mile-long Great Barrier Reef--already died in two events related to global warming and ocean acidification. Unless we reverse the damage we have done, virtually all or all coral reefs (the rainforests of the ocean) will be extinct by 2100. We are literally killing the oceans in a very direct way. 

Humans and all other living things on Earth evolved in an Earth that kept within a narrow range of average temperatures and with rather stable climate, and by pushing the system outside those parameters, we are setting in motion the ""Sixth Extinction"" of life on Earth. Not only does this mean killing off much of what we love about the natural world, human civilization is totally dependent of the health of the Earth's ecosystems, so unless we turn things around rapidly, humanity will witness in my children's lifetimes hundreds of millions to billions of human deaths due to our warming of the planet and destruction of the biosphere.

It's hard to face, but those ARE the facts on the ground. 

Take care."

""oh sure, the stuff that is usually roughly 20 percent of the budget."" What part of the budget would you cut (Social security? Medicare? Veteran's benefits? Scientific research? Transportation? People who make sure the food supply is safe? Unemployment benefits?), and how would you fix the damage caused by those cuts?


""Government can't spend money efficiently. I've seen 3 potholes be fixed for 200k.""


No you haven't, but the myth that the public sector is inherently less efficient with money than the private sector is one of those myths that won't die (and it won't die because the billionaires and corporations keep promoting that profitable myth through their foundations and media outlets). All around the world, developed countries have universal health care programs that cost 40-60% on the dollar of what ours cost, and people live longer in those countries. As the federal government has privatized various government functions, they are paying private contractors double and triple what it cost to have the government do the same work. The private sector has 3-4 inescapable forms of waste built in: Marketing costs, exorbitant executive salaries, overcharging to make a profit, and in some cases, lobbying costs. WE would be paying 5-20 cents on the dollar for drugs if the government didn't farm out the work to corporations (after the initial research was often done by government scientists and paid for by our tax dollars). I'm almost 60, and I've watched for 40 years as America got hijacked by the myths that ""government is the problem,"" and ""everything in life works better if you run it more like a business."" Drinking that neoliberal koolaid gave us planet-destroying factory-farming, middle-class destroying ""trickle-down economics,"" stagnant wages for 40 years while the 1% looted the economy of all its gains, a global economic meltdown, struggling families, growing economic insecurity, epidemics of anxiety, depression, drug overdoses, and suicides, narrowed and dumbed-down curriculum aimed at pointless high-stakes testing, a government (and media) corrupted by corporate influence, and the rapid destruction of the web of life our own lives depend on.

Man is responsible of 30% of that 0.04 % so for 0.012% of the gaz in the atmosphere. Even the tiny ants on earth are making more CO2 than us! H2O is the principal warming gaz as you can see in a sauna.
C02 is the gaz of the life itself on earth. Without it no LIFE.

"daNorse","2019-08-25T13:31:01Z","These are the facts. World population is increasing. We need more food! How to grow more food: (1) A warmer climate. (2) More food for the plants i.e CO2 in the air. Luckily we have seen improvements already.  We have slowly gotten out of the Little Ice Age during the last 1-200 years with the planet warming up again, and with higher levels of CO2 we have seen a greening of the planet the last decades, which has resulted in a huge increase in global food production. 
The data: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth?
And because of this and an unprecedented access to cheap fossile fuel during the last 100 years we are now better off, when it comes to economy, health, education, technology, social equality, war/peace, etc, than any time in our known history. We are in a time with more resources and human well-beeing than ever before, and it's getting better every year. A hundred years ago you were more educated than most if you could read, and wealthier than most if you owned shoes. And you had to work 12+ hours every day just to put food on the table. We should be thankful for living in this time and not in the ages before us. The generations living today are more privileged than any generation before us, thanks to cheap fossile fuel."

"SwiftlyTiltingPlanet","2019-08-31T19:03:46Z","The term ""climate change"" has been in use since the 1950s.

The oil industry has trained you well, standing on their shoulders and parotting 'hoax, hoax, hoax."" How's it feel to be indoctrinated by a billion-dollar marketing strategy?"
"SwiftlyTiltingPlanet","2019-08-31T22:05:36Z","@gpettipas  Contrary to popular belief, the term ""climate change"" has been around since the 1950s and it was actually a hardcore, pro-business Republican who pushed for everyone to use it instead of global warming, because he thought the sound of ""global warming"" was too scary. Climate change is actually more fitting because it's more descriptive of its multiple symptoms than global warming alone, which is why most of us have adopted it. No scientist decreed to call it climate change because he was trying to hide something. That's oil industry-funded propaganda."

Historically this usually means a slight drop in average global temperature. But there is no drop. July was the hottest month in recorded history. The last five years were the hottest in recorded history. 

Earth's outer atmosphere has actually COOLED, according to NASA satellite monitoring. But earth's inner atmosphere continues to WARM unabated. Empirical evidence of a greenhouse effect.

Ground-based spectroscopy clearly identifies heat passing through molecules of C02 and methane in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth. Empirical evidence of a greenhouse effect. It's not the sun."

"SwiftlyTiltingPlanet","2019-10-22T10:40:55Z","@Karl Wheatley That was a great post. It reassures me that there are at least a few informed, pro-science people left out there. Thankyou for your efforts. Ten thumbs up."
"Karl Wheatley","2019-10-21T23:08:27Z","With all due respect, I believe you are not looking at the big picture and how all the parts of the system interact. Yes, in a controlled experiment in a greenhouse, more CO2 gets you more plant growth. That part you have right. But that experiment doesn't reflect the real-world ripple effects of global increases in CO2, meaning those experiments are useless for guiding policy. So how do natural systems actually work? In the real world, increased CO2 is causing global warming which in turn causes the atmosphere to hold more water (7% more for every 1 degree C increase in temperature), which is leading to the drying out of ecosystems--for example, across the American west. The combination of warming and drier soils than has allowed for things like the beetle infestations in the Rockies. The combination of these factors has led to staggering die offs of forests, for example, 
>800 million ""standing dead"" trees in Colorado alone. This increase in dead trees makes forest fires worse, releasing even more CO2 into the atmosphere, thus causing even more warming and an acceleration of this kind of destruction. The dried out ground also releases more CO2, and the whole cycle leads to epic storms, floods, and droughts. Meanwhile, the warming has already made crops such as grains to have 5-8% less of key nutrients, thus promoting poor human health, overeating, or both. More broadly, pumping most of that heat and EXCESS CO2 human pumped into the atmosphere was absorbed by the oceans, making them warmer and 30% more acidic. Marine life isn't designed for these rapid changes in their ecosystem, and the last time the Earth warmed this rapidly, >90% of life in the oceans went extinct. THAT is where our reckless disruption of ecosystem balance is taking us: For example, half of the largest living thing on Earth--the 2400 mile-long Great Barrier Reef--already died in two events related to global warming and ocean acidification. Unless we reverse the damage we have done, virtually all or all coral reefs (the rainforests of the ocean) will be extinct by 2100. We are literally killing the oceans in a very direct way. 

Humans and all other living things on Earth evolved in an Earth that kept within a narrow range of average temperatures and with rather stable climate, and by pushing the system outside those parameters, we are setting in motion the ""Sixth Extinction"" of life on Earth. Not only does this mean killing off much of what we love about the natural world, human civilization is totally dependent of the health of the Earth's ecosystems, so unless we turn things around rapidly, humanity will witness in my children's lifetimes hundreds of millions to billions of human deaths due to our warming of the planet and destruction of the biosphere.

It's hard to face, but those ARE the facts on the ground. 

Take care."
"SwiftlyTiltingPlanet","2019-08-31T19:29:45Z","Have you seen the data on how high C02 strips staple crops of their natural defenses against insects? Or the data showing how higher C02 depletes plants of their znc, iron and protein, making them less nutritious for human consumption? Have you seen the EPA stats showing increasing epic rainstorms since 1958, which wash away topsoil and fertilizer and decimate plants? How about the increasing severity of droughts? The C02-plant equation is not nearly as simple as the oil industry-funded blogs would have you believe. The consensus among scientists is that while C02 can clearly make plants more lush, the C02-warming problem and its side effects more than wipe out any benefits."

"Helgefan","2019-08-22T12:32:16Z","Why do you think sun activity (like the Maunder Minimum) is important for the warming trend of the last couple of decades, when it doesn't even correlate with global temperature? Since the 80s, sun activity has decreased while global temperature kept increasing. So I think it's save to say that _nowadays_ sun activity is clearly not the main driver of global warming!
Also, the medieval warm period is much overrated by climate deniers (or sceptic or whatever you'd like to be labelled). Sure, it had natural causes such as changes in ocean currents, decreased volcanic activity and also sun activity, but it was mainly limited to parts of the Northern Hemisphere. And when looking instead at the *global* temperature during that time of the MWP, it was considerably colder than the global temperature of the previous 50 years."

Co2 is as vital to life on the planet as oxygen and water. 400 ppm is already homeopathic compared to periods in the past when it was 1000s of ppm and life was flourishing. 150 ppm is the level at which all life would and has died. At 400 ppm, the current global level is LOW. 600 is common under a forest canopy. 2k to 3k on a submarine or in the space station. Co2 is pumped into actual greenhouses at 1000s of ppm because it helps with photosynth and water uptake. Without Co2 we would not be able to digest or breathe. 5. They claim that the oil companies are holding back research and are buying off their opposition. Actually, the oil industry has its head down and is funding alternative energy research and giving a lot to the IPCC. The real catastrophy is the one these snake oil salesmen would instigate if they were successful at making everyone hysterical enough to panic. Not to mention the billions they are siphoning up in tax dollars for their phony models and ridiculous prognostications, not one of which has come true. And this is the last and most damning evidence of the lie, the absolutely stunning record of failed predictions over the last 30 years. A very important aspect of any scientific theory is that it must predict effects. When the predictions fail, the theory has been disproven."
"Frey Faust","2019-07-11T08:31:24Z","The climate catastrophists make several fatal errors when they argue for their POV. 1. They are completely unskeptical about a subject which is very obviously controversial among climate scientists and earth scientists in general. There is no such thing as a partial consensus. Consensus is total or it is not consensus. Consensus is a matter of opinion, not scientific protocol for proof. Absolute conviction in a scientist is already suspicious, but when its about a controversial subject, that discredits them utterly. 2.

"Anthony K. Slater","2019-07-08T23:53:11Z","Where Does the Carbon Dioxide Really Come From?

 Professor Ian Plimer's book in a brief summary. 

 PLIMER: ""Okay, here's the bombshell. The volcanic eruption in Iceland . Since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS, NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.

 Of course, you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying to suppress - it's that vital chemical compound that every plant requires to live and grow and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans and all animal life.

 I know....it's very disheartening to realize that all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your kids ""The Green Revolution"" science project, throwing out all of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and speedboat, vacationing at home instead of abroad,nearly getting hit every day on your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs with $10.00 light bulbs.....well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days.

 The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth's atmosphere in just four days - yes, FOUR DAYS - by that volcano in Iceland has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.

 I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should mention that when the volcano Mt Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth.

 Yes, folks, Mt Pinatubo was active for over One year - think about it.

 Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect climate change.

 And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years. And it happens every year.

 Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus 'human-caused' climate-change scenario.

 Hey, isn't it interesting how they don't mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just 'Climate Change' - you know why?

 It's because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century and these global warming folks got caught with their pants down.

 And, just keep in mind that you might yet have an Emissions Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer.

 It won't stop any volcanoes from erupting, that's for sure.

 But, hey, ......go give the world a hug and have a nice day.

James Hanson projections are INCREDIBLE. What are you reading that you have this so wrong? Look here:
https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming

Hanson, from WAY BACK IN 1981. Wow. Incredible. It happened, but you say ""it never happened."" Strange.

""The point is not about co2 being the actor of warming.""
ALL evidence points to CO2 being the primary forcing. Only a few (and I mean about three) climate scientists think the primary forcing is something other than CO2, and they never tell us what could be the natural cause if not CO2. They dance around, saying we cannot possibly know, and when asked why we are warming, they say ""we don't know."" In the mean time, the super-majority of scientists have proven that it is CO2.

We are warming. We will continue to warm. CO2 is the culprit."

You dont know what have i studied...
So let me present myself.
I am a engineer and cartographer, i work with satelite imaging.
I am not a climatologist. So of course i speak from what i ve read in the internet.
I took the 0.2 celsius from a graph of the University of Alabama – Huntsville (UAH) by Dr. Roy Spencer – Base Period 1981-2010 temperature for the lower atmosphere.
I noticed that you are certain that theres is a scientific consensus on the global warming topic.
But there is not... I have found TONS of scientists that desagree with IPCC(and alike) reports and have shown very good evidence.
Some big names like Richard Lindzen.
James Hansen predicted a ton of stuff 30 years ago, and it never happenned...
So, this does not yet mean that the global warming alarmists are wrong.
We are observing this for what? 50 years? It is NOTHING compared to earth's age and climate cycles...
But that does mean that the global warming alarmists have no evidence to make ALL THIS FUSS!!!

No, it is CO2. Did your gut feelings get in the way of actual science?

""The point is not about co2 being the actor of warming.""

Exxon paid for the scientists, but it was the United Nations that picked the scientists, which were scientists in the IPCC. They were not Exxon's scientists. Second, the big push for global warming started in the mid 80's because between 1940-1980 CO2 was increasing in the atmosphere, however, the global temperature was decreasing quite substantially (which is the opposite affect of what the ""climate change scientists"" claim will happen). And Third, the whole ""drought scare"" is also a hoax! The warmer the global climate gets, the more evaporation that occurs, which in turn, puts more moisture in the atmosphere, which produces clouds (which help cool surface temperatures), which produce rainfall!
To be honest, we are in an upward trend for heat and hi temperatures, which at some time, will be met by a cooling trend (then they get to scare us with an Ice Age scare again, like they did in the 50's 60's and 70's)"

If you do the research you will find that climate change (or as it used to be called: global warming before they realised they couldn't call it that anymore) is a complete scam which was created and used as a weapon for scaremongering in the hopes of furthering the one world government agenda and further taxation. They would have us believe that co2 is killing the earth although the earth would burn or freeze without it and all animal/human and plant life would die. They blame humans for the production of co2 even though our output is a tiny fraction and when global warming is brought up they always ignore the sun and ignore the fact that the earth was warmer hundreds of years ago back in the medieval ages where we didn't have factories, engines ect... the earth has been changing for millions of years, before we even existed. The hysteria is manufactured and it's in full swing. Anyone with half a brain knows that we and the planet as a whole needs co2 to thrive and anyone buying the global warming 2.0 scam needs to wake up and do their research into how it was designed as a weapon."

Then we must not forget that our climate change has already existed in history around the 700s and that during the Roman era climatic variations were superior to ours without any emission of CO2.  Ecology is important from the point of view of the cleanliness of the environment and from a conservation point of view of our resources, but climate change can not be predicted and we can not even bind it to some  something as simple as CO2 (although the media do it constantly, it's a great way to get a good political image ....)

That, right there, is the exact reason why I didn't understand climate change, that part is almost always oversimplified. Why would the atmosphere let radiation enter but not leave? Well, it's very simple: greenhouse gases are (mostly) transparent to light and UV rays, that hit the ground and heat it up. The ground is constantly cooling down by emitting infrared radiation that would usually leave Earth, but since greenhouse gases are opaque to infrared light, it heats up the atmosphere. If we continue releasing greenhouse gases or remove the plants that get rid of the excess, we'll all cook to death.
I hope someone sees this and stops being a climate change denier."

Big government got together with wealthly new energy companies and created an organisation called the IPCC to regularly release scary reports so that the populations would cry out to the governments to have more power and take more money. There goal was to get rid of the old energy companies, and give the new ones billions in tax payer subsidies - Obama gave them $150 billion. They are paying scientists tens of billions, and even Exxon is on the scam now and funds global warming scientists to release reports. It means they get tax concessions and sell more and more gas that used to be just discharged or burnt off as waste. Now they make billions from it. They were able to do this as backup energy to unreliable solar and wind was energy and gas plants can ramp up an down quicker than coal.

My science/evironment teacher told us that plastic is a lot more better for the environment since wood production would lead to more cut down trees and more CO2 (+its cheaper) . She said as long as people throw away plastic in trash cans and not in the wild/ocean it would have been so much better. I do believe this is true and i think we should keep using plastic. As long as we all are able to throw it away in the trash instead of the wild. It will be much cheaper and there would be less CO2 outcome if we stop producing more wood/paper materials intead of plastic.

That is all I have to say. Feel free to correct me on things if some of these statements are wrong."

The certainty of the flipping of the poles theorem is debatable, it doesn't just happen overnight, it takes time, it is not as though I'm going to wake up tomorrow and say ""oh damn, I'm going to have to buy a new compass"". So even it were to happen it would be a gradual change, during which humans would adapt. Yet, one cannot also purely blame that for climate as the greenhouse effect caused by our carbon emissions is as definite as the fact that I will be able to talk confidently to a girl (if you knew me that you would find it more funny and depressing at the same time). Yet you cannot also blame it on the previous generation, ever since industrialisation became common spread it became clear that our planet was changing in a negative and accelerating manner. Thankyou if you have come to the end of this comment and not been bored out of your wits and I hope that before anyone of you make a one-sided comment on the cause of climate change you will think back to this mutual comment on several of the many factors of climate change. I am sorry that I have not explained more factors but there are further readings out there if you are intrigued by this important topic. Thankyou and have a nice day :)"

Too many mini malls, strip malls, Starbucks, parking lots ,roads and not enough trees. Up until the mid-1800s 80% of America was covered by Woodlands , now maybe 8 to 12% is .

"JazzBuff23","2019-06-05T21:21:23Z","The second half of Eisenhower's Industrial Complex Speech has been all but ignored. It states:


“Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.”
“The prospect of domination of the nation’s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.”


Warning us of the university scientist creating the danger of setting public policy is exactly what the government grant grabbing junk science junkies are doing the the CO2 hoax. We exhale CO2 and the Carbon Cycle is the most natural thing in nature.

"Paul A.","2019-06-05T04:49:05Z","It is interesting to hear people who know absolutely nothing about science pontificate on the subject. The biggest lie about climate change is, ""The science is settled"". Real science is NEVER settled and every true scientist will tell you that. It is a never ending process and we only ever have a view of an intermediate step. The flat earthers were proven wrong. Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest names in science, was proven wrong. Einstein, who's name is all but synonymous with genius was proven wrong. And so have or will all the rest who call themselves scientists be proven wrong, sooner or later. There are always errors in every scientific theory and later theories will overtake them. Laws of science are just well tested theories and they also topple in the face of new facts. 



I do not claim to know what the world's climate will do in the future. I do know it has managed to stumble along without our ""help"" for billions of years. I suspect it will continue to do so. 



By the way, just how many of the global climate alarmists are not being financed by government funding? Funding that is dolled out ONLY to ""scientists"" who can be depended on to claim there is cause for alarm. And why have these ""scientists"" adjusted the data to conform with their preconceived theories? The answer is obvious: the true data, without those arbitrary adjustments does not. It, in fact, clearly shows no real climate change. 



In case you don't see the above process: Rich Financial People finance politicians / politicians are elected / elected representatives appoint leaders in government agencies / government agencies provide funding for scientific research / and that scientific research provides the ""evidence"" for climate change that the Rich Financial People want. And researchers who do not go along with that are NOT FUNDED. But many non-funded scientists DO look at the climate and the ""evidence"" provided by those funded ones and just shake their heads. It's a plot all right, just not the one you think. 



It is not the coal and oil companies who are trying to make a killing here. It is the companies who want to develop the grossly inefficient alternate energy sources. They know they can not compete with traditional energy so they want to ""level"" the playing field with my money and yours. They are taking tax payer money to develop energy sources that will cost those same tax payers more when they use them. AND because those alternate energy sources are really more expensive, they also USE more of our resources so they are the total opposite of ""green"". They gobble up our resources instead of saving them. On that basis along, they should be totally banned, but I do not like the government calling the shots. We simply should NOT subsidise them and just let them compete with the present energy sources while standing on their own feet. No government, no tax payer help ever. Let the free market decide if they are better. Yes, based on price. Price is an excellent way to judge just how ""green"" something is. In fact, it is probably the only way to quantify just how ""green"" something is. Higher price equals more resources expended and therefore, equates with less ""green"". It really is common sense. Not some ""guilt trip"" that has been manufactured just to help some new companies that will make these expensive and NON-GREEN technologies and make THEIR investors rich in the process."

A graph of past CO2 concentrations and past temperatures shows a direct correlation between more CO2 and higher global temperatures. CO2 does help plants grow and is essential to life, but that’s not the point. The amount of it is the problem as the natural carbon cycle has been upset with us putting in more carbon (fossil fuels) and disrupting natural sinks (deforestation). Methane is also a naturally occurring substance and by itself isn’t bad. But having large concentrations of it in the atmosphere is also harmful since CH4 has over 20x the potency of CO2 in terms of its ability to trap heat.

The core contains a concentration of highly radioactive materials due to the accident, but interestingly, the other reactors were kept running for about a decade after the accident as the radioactivity drops off significantly with even comparatively minor distance.  Arguably, that core isn't going anywhere, but encasing it provides a longer time frame to deal with the issue.  I would also add chernobyl used a reactor design (RBMK) not used by most other countries (including the USA) due to this kind of safety issue.  They ran a ""test"" and the result was the explosion.

_""weather reporting has been improving drastically,""_
*True, but this is due to nothing more than satellites and the ability to literally watch storm systems in real-time.  They are still just as baffled as ever when a freak storm pops up out of nowhere.*
_""climate models have been able to reproduce past data, and have made predictions that have been confirmed.""_
*That is a deceptive statement.  Can they tweak a model to coax out the desired result?  Sure, but when they feed in the next data set they have to start re-tweaking all over again.  If your equations and algorithms need to be altered every time you change data sets...  your model is worthless.*
_""This leads to an imbalance of CO2,""_
*I do not believe CO2 is remotely capable of controlling the climate to the levels proclaimed by the alarmists.  I believe it was selected because it can be tied directly to humans.  Even if CO2 WERE capable of controlling the climate, I have yet to hear a single expert identify the #1 cause--BY FAR--of atmospheric CO2 and CH4...  and it's NOT HUMANS.  It's a process involving earthquakes and microbes, and we don't hear about it because THE EXPERTS ARE CLUELESS.  This is a glaring indication that the supposed experts DO NOT TRULY UNDERSTAND all that they claim to understand, and it's a huge red flag that we should investigate much more fully before passing sweeping legislation that will be devastating to all but the wealthy elite.*


*The reforms that would be imposed on 99% of the world would mean an end to automobile and air travel, no fossil fuels for heating our homes..  and alternatives would likely be unaffordable, electronics for the wealthy only, back to candles for lighting our homes at night...  basically, we'd be partying like it's 1799..!!  If the evidence supported an end to civilization without going this route..  then we do what we've gotta do.  But the evidence says that this is a scheme..  and we CANNOT GO GENTLY INTO THAT  GOOD NIGHT.*"
"zorblin","2019-06-05T03:12:58Z","@freemind You are completely strawmanning, let's have a quality discourse. Weather IS NOT CLIMATE. Climate is _in general_, while weather is very specific. The reason weather is hard to predict, is the sheer amount of variables. Furthermore, weather reporting has been improving drastically, and climate models have been able to reproduce past data, and have made predictions that have been confirmed. It's not about the prediction, it's about the science. So, take CO2. When an infrared photon hits the molecule, it vibrates, due to the energy. Afterwards, it vibrates again, releasing an infrared photon. This is caused by the CO2 molecule having 3 or more atoms, leading to complex vibration modes that allow them to interact with IR photons/waves. Secondly, human CO2 emission has been coinciding along with the natural trapping of CO2 in sinks such as plants, or the oceans. This leads to an imbalance of CO2, as before the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 emitted by humans was able to be absorbed by natural carbon sinks. But now, we exceed the amount of possible absorbance, leading to an increase in CO2."
"freemind","2019-06-03T23:19:06Z","@zorblin - Not so.  The truth is that the ""experts"" can't predict the WEATHER beyond a few days out, yet we are supposed to believe that they truly understand and can accurately predict long-term future global climatic events???  Please...  The models are WRONG!  All of them!!  Why?  Because the scientists are guessing about pretty much EVERYTHING.  This is just another scam to impose more taxes and usurp the few liberties we have left."

"Todd Gurley","2019-10-29T07:53:33Z","Co2 is the main driver of plant growth. It's been 10 or 20 times this high for hundreds of millions of years at a time on this planet. We need more.

"william baikie","2019-06-03T06:11:13Z","@Callahan1998 forests are mostly being destroyed due to lack of cheaper fuel, like petroleum and coal. People chop trees down for fires. Also large commercial operations are clearing forests for bio-fuels mandated by governments to 'save the planet'. We should be assisting them to get nuclear power and better utilize their land. In the US we have reduced acreage of farmland while at the same time increase crop output and much farmland has been reforested naturally. Here in the US thousands of acres are now being cleared for wind and solar farms, again due to dumb government mandates. ""Save the Planet"" idiots are going to ruin it!"
"william baikie","2019-06-03T05:54:34Z","@Callahan1998 If 1998 is your birth year, take some STEM courses and learn about spectroscopy and absorption bands. CO2's greenhouse gas effect logarithmically declines. So doubling the concentration of CO2 from pre-industrial levels changes net downwelling forcing in watts/sq/m2 from from 258 to 262. CO2 has caused more greening of the earth, +15% since satellite observations started. Crop yields boosted. Deserts are shrinking. Also forest cover in growing, one hears of deforestation often, but the truth is we have more forests now than 100 years ago. Nuclear energy is the solution no matter who is right, alarmist or skeptics."
"Callahan1998","2019-06-03T05:52:14Z","william baikie so even if we did grow back all those trees torn down in deforested parts of the world, that would just take fractions of the CO2 while probably giving another fraction, we’ll that sucks, probably sure Geoengineering has its pros and cons as well I’ve read scientists tried to do this thing when Volcanos erupt they act as mirrors, and the results are that crops wouldn’t get enough sunlight"
"william baikie","2019-06-03T05:39:48Z","@Callahan1998 sure, carbon sequestration is proven and even profitable. CO2 is injected into natural gas and petroleum well to assist in extraction and reduce subsistence. [drop in surface elevation]. But the scale needed to sequester all the CO2 emitted would be mind boggling. Probably the best way is to utilize nature and photosynthesis. But that is happening already, problem is plants and algae die and decompose, releasing CO2 again. You would need to bury in such a way as not to decompose."

Earth's climate is remarkably stable in reality, and there is absolutely no chance of any ""runaway warming"" or catastrophic changes due to mankind's energy production; the math isn't there; the science isn't there; computer models are not reality.

Without some outside cosmic influence or unknown subcrustal, deep core event occurring in our planet, there is not enough sequestered carbon to disrupt the climate; the energy isn't there; the amount of releasable carbon is not significant; carbon absorbs only so much energy and the rest is radiated out into space; the ""sponge effect"" trumps the ""greenhouse effect""- and the effects are measurable, and prove the Iris Effect right; no hot spot in tropics; decreasing ""warming per PPM"" per doubling of CO2; at most 1.5°C for 600ppm, then 0.7° for 1200ppm, then MAYBE 0.4° for 2400ppm and it would literally take millions of years for that to happen...

Again, barring any sort of additional energy bombarding us from space; CO2 just cannot store energy forever, so the greenhouse effect is more effected by water vapor and other trace gases.

That is what the science really says; like it or not; there is no looming catastrophe; climate indeed changes; life adapts; we adapt."

Stop the release of carbon monoxide and other poisonous gases and stop polluting the environment this would give us more than enough time to safely develop alternatives. Alternatives that the production and use of don't pollute the environment. 
FYI
   Carbon dioxide (CO2) is actually good for plant life. plants grow the best when CO2 are between 1200 ppm to 1500 ppm and doesn't become harmful to animal life until about 8000 ppm. Plant growth slows down when CO2 drops below 220 ppm and virtually stops at about 150 ppm"

Here are a few headlines from that period: “International team of specialists finds no end in sight to 30 year cooling trend in northern hemisphere“. The New York Times, January 5, 1978. “Colder winters herald dawn of new Ice Age“. The Washington post January 11, 1970. “New Ice Age coming – it’s already getting colder“.

How many people know that during the early Triassic period, It rained for 2 million years?! The fact that there is a chance of coastal cities around the world becoming submerged, merely points to our own shortsightedness as human beings. Of course there is climate change – the climate is always changing, it has been since the beginning of time. Are we contributing to it? Possibly, but be assured it would be happening even if there were no human beings on the planet."

Real scientists do not gerrymander Earth weather station data to show abnormal warming which does not exist in fact, as NOAA has done.  Real scientists do not ""fiddle"" with temperature records, as NASA has done. Under pressure from Obama, NASA changed the way it calculates world temperatures to include ocean temperatures instead of just land mass temperatures.  The only reason to do this was to create an artificial spike in Earth temperatures on a graph that Obama could use to scare the public.  When science is for sale and under the command of politicians, it is no longer science.  Fewer than 50% of real climatologists believe that dangerous man made global warming due to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is proven.  The 97% consensus figure is, and always has been, pure fiction.

The predictions of climate change alarmist have been grossly exaggerated, because their models have amplification factors that ignore the fact our Earth has a stable climate and is robust. The idea man can control the weather is pretty arrogant. I'm all for conservation of fossil fuels, reducing pollution waste garbage.

 Video's like this says Time Magazine had a cover of the earth On Fire. Who gives a s*** with Time Magazine says, that's not science. 0.5% of scientists think that the temperature increase of a lousy 1° over a hundred and 120 years is all man-made. There is no consensus that's just a lie. Scientists are individuals. I want to see this consensus. Who are the science and what are they all agreeing on? Scientist get grants from pro climate change agenda, they will support that narrative if they want to keep getting grants.

Nobody is denying climate changes. Calling people deniers is just propaganda to stop any kind of discussion or debate. Everybody knows the climate is changing but why? Is it 100% all man made. No. 100% man caused change is bull shit. Is it 0% man-made? Here's a shocker we don't know. Science has no way of proving either one. Based on what we do know.

"evolution rhythm","2019-05-26T16:23:19Z","The root cause of the biggest Lie about human caused climate change is not undertanding the evidence or trying to repress the scientific evidence. Though the former merely ignorance & the latter is deception,


Humans, in general,  make decisions due to the evolved cost/benefit analysis psychology and the more immediate  (though less far less accurate overall) & more emotive response behavioural psychology (i.e. instinct). Mitigating climate change and environmental degradation in general will require a significant change to the typical (a statistical average) human behaviour (including emotively driven psychology response) of the average human (see evolutionary psychology topics regrading ""The stone age mind""). Therefore it will (is proving)  be difficult for humanity (on average) to make the necessary changes to any particular civilisation in time to prevent some of the most dire consequences of ecosystem failures (i.e. “They” (an average) won’t see it coming until it’s too late to prevent the “worst case” scenario of climate change and ecosystem dysfunction). 
Thus, in order to try & best circumnavigate severe ecosystem dysfunction (e.g. to the food web) ,human populations must understand, A.S.A.P ,themselves more accurately (on average) and what drives their behaviours. Also why these behaviours have evolved to be the way they are (e.g. Emotions that fit within the Esteem dynamics like Envy, Pride, Guilt, Hate, Love etc.). Ideally these current environmental destructive behaviours can be mitigated through a democratic & cooperative route. Alternatively, over time (worst case scenario), humanities behaviours that positively correlate with causing environmental degradation will be reduced (by severe population reduction) by the ecosystem limiting factors they have caused (cause and effect). Natural laws that all species are ultimately governed by."

I feel like he's ignoring the actual scientific debate in favour of what he wants to believe. The actual debate is over significance - whether climate change is mild and manageable, or is an existential threat to humanity. Conceptualising why nobody wanted to put all their eggs in the climate change basket is understandable when end of the world claims are made about almost every human activity that improves human life and development. Even being fair to the actual denialist, the claims of climate alarmists were that by the 2000s the sea level would rise by 10-20ft. Comparing that to what we know now is plenty of reason to be skeptical. Even todays climate models have so much error built into the simulations that after 10 years you can't even accurately measure the effect of any changes made today.

Get your science from scientists, not ideologically biased media sources and fossil fuel industry-funded ""conservative think tanks"". There is scientific consensus about human-caused global warming from fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions: http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus 

There is nothing conservative about free pollution, it causes market failure and is bad for everyone but those who are being subsidized by the rest of us by putting up with free pollution.

Here's how to put a price on climate pollution in a way that we all come out ahead: http://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend"

If we look at historic concentrations, the co2 level has barely been over 300ppm in the past 800.000 years. It seems that plants do just fine outside your” normal range”.

And how does any of this negate the fact that co2 does cause higher temperatures? That ocean absorption cause acidification? Increased salinity?"

"To be Advised","2019-05-24T05:53:02Z","Væringjar You said it. You said and I quote “ if plants would die without Co2 how were there plants before humans?” Your words. That sentence means that plants according to you don’t need Co2 or there was no Co2 before humans. Maybe that’s not how you meant to write it but this is how it was written. Just look at Chernobyl, 33 years after a devastating man made disaster it’s now full of plants and animals. Earth will recover from anything we can throw at it. We might not, but the planet will. So all I’m saying is, the slogan “save the planet” is wrong. We want to save ourselves, the planet will be just fine. It had a giant asteroid hit, that wiped out 97% of all life but the planet was ok. It’s still here, life restarted and now we are here. Just not for that long that’s all. Life has been wiped off of this planet 5 times that we know of. What makes you think that that was the last time. This has been going on for millions of years and will continue on with or without us. You can do your own research, I don’t want to point you into any direction. The fact that you are communicating with me means that you are interested. There are hundreds of papers on Climate Change on both sides. You have to draw your own conclusions. But without reading both, the decision can be one sided."
"Væringjar","2019-05-24T05:16:02Z","Gabriel De Winters I’m glad you followed along in high school biology. When has someone claimed that there wasn’t co2 before humans? You say that humans can’t affect the eco-systems, i’d like to see what papers demonstrate that. Climate change and global warming are simply two aspects of the same phenomena, no one changed it. But since you have done _your own research_ i’d like some sources."
"To be Advised","2019-05-24T04:04:25Z","Væringjar Ok. Clearly you are a child. So I’ll explain. Co2 comes from animals, humans, everything that breathes in air and uses the oxygen out of the air to live, breaths out Co2 among other gases. Also Co2 was always in our atmosphere, from volcanoes from fire and from other chemical reactions. What you just said before is really don’t make sense at all. I suggest that you do your own research and don’t listen to anybody. Not even me. Just do your own research. We might put more Co2 in the air now but not enough to upset the echo system of a planet. There were ice ages before, that started with global warming. We weren’t here than. So how was that than? Also, just think about this for a moment. Why are they calling it Climate Change now, how come it changed from Global Warming? It’s all just scare tactics for the young generation. I don’t know why, but that is the case. I had the Cold War to deal with when I was young. That has ended, now this crap for the new generation. I hope you look into this a lot deeper just for your own benefit and understanding."
"Væringjar","2019-05-23T13:13:30Z","Gabriel De Winters allow me to use your own extremely flawed logic against you, if plants would die without co2 how were there plants before humans? 

We know that there’s a link between temperature and co2, we know that humans contribute a substantial amount of co2 to the natural carbon flux. Why would it not be logical that humans can drive up temperatures? I agree that the planet couldn’t care less about humans in the big picture, but don’t you think it would be prudent to make the planet a good environment for humans to thrive?"

"Baguette Gott","2019-09-19T20:47:20Z","@freemind Yeah well obviously if the rock's too big it will still hit - the point was just that isn't really a safer place for us somewhere else. The risk is very low but even if it wasn't, we could do absolutely nothing about it. 

And I mean, earth does get hit by meteors every single day. It's just small ones and the planet is big so they most likely won't end up in my backyard."
"freemind","2019-09-19T20:16:45Z","@Baguette Gott - You are correct in your assertion that the atmosphere prevents most meteorites ever impacting the Earth at all.  However, that only applies to objects the size of a grain of sand---up to maybe the size of your fist.  Thankfully that covers the majority of potential impactors.  The larger meteorites..  of the Extinction Level Event variety would not be burned up in or even slowed by the Earth's atmosphere.  Therefore I think it's important to make people aware that the fear-mongering is based on fallacious propaganda.  Once it is commonly understood how few of the craters are actually due to impact, people will have one less major stress-point to manage.  We all have enough to worry about without adding fabricated boogeymen to the mix.  

Most alarmism is rooted in ignorance, and is utilized as a weapon against a trusting populous to gain power, money and support for otherwise unpopular politics.  We can't rule out a civilization-ending meteor impact, super-volcano eruption, climate disaster or invasion by hostile aliens, but it's nice to know that the threat is only minimal."
"Baguette Gott","2019-09-19T14:56:02Z","@freemind The important thing is that there's not really a place in this universe where you're safe from meteorites. The safest you can probably get is on a planet that has an actual atmosphere which will cause most rocks coming down to burn up before they even hit the ground, effectively shielding us from a lot of them - and look, that's exactly where we are right now.."

"Sam Lair","2019-05-11T17:18:51Z","In the history of mankind, 50% of all carbon released into the atmosphere occurred in the last 30 years. Indeed, 
the last time there was this much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist. The burning of fossil fuels and the chemical-intensive industrial agriculture are the main drivers of climate change. The good news is that humans have the power to stop, and potentially reverse, climate change, but the solution is not fancy new carbon-capturing technology (biochar is the way to go as far as sequestration goes / it would also reduce the use of artificial fertilizer production and nitrous oxide emissions). A significant part of the solution to climate change is to harness the power of Mother Nature. Harnessing the energy of earth (geothermal), water (hydroelectric), air (wind generators) and sun (solar cells and collectors) and, also, in the form of organic regenerative agriculture and the restoration of forests, peatlands, mangroves and other ecosystem habitats capable of drawing down and storing excess atmospheric carbon."

The Global Warming scam is an invented idea to allow control. If you dictate carbon, you effectively control most things. Fuel costs, production costs, collective taxes on over priced 'environmental saving' things. These protesters are clueless. Think about it for one minute. Petrol for example is expensive, one reason given is to protect the planet - load of rubbish. Petrol is a necessary evil most of us have to buy. Governments know this so instead of banning it, they over charge for it under the veil of saving the planet. No amount of campaigning will alter things. Things will alter when, and only when, oil runs out. It has been running out for the last thirty years but still seems as available as ever. Global warming is all smoke and mirrors to allow for higher costs. Unless you have access to raw data you do not know if the ice cap is really melting do you?

Climate change didn't just suddenly spring into action either The climate has been in a state of perpetual change for it's entire existence; 2+ billion years. Example: The sea level has risen 200 feet in tbe last 2,000 years. The only force that can make Earth's climate fluctuate is the Sun and when the Sun produces more intense light/radiation or an increase of heat then Earth's climate becomes warmer. This is elementary school science and basic common sense. The reason nobody talks about this is because we cant do shit about it and we are in the back end of an extinction level event.

"Joe","2019-04-26T07:12:15Z","Ok lets get this straight. Climate change is something that happens naturally in an ecosystem as large as own. Throughout the many million of years prior to us humans being on this planet, there have been major fluctuations in temperature and C02 levels in the atmosphere that this ""climate change"" debate can be deemed as completely down to the long term natural variations in the earth's climate. In the age of the dinosaurs, they were able to exist due to the much higher C02 levels. The mega flora was able to exist due to these high C02 levels. Change in climate is completely down to how the earth changes in its position around the sun and on its axis. With the attention on melting ice caps, it has been proven that the water re-freezes on the opposite side of the globe where it is colder. The variations in temperature are down to less than a degree which is once again completely down to the natural variation in our earth's climate. On studies of some mountains that are near the area in which I live, over the past decade or so the levels of snow have been gradually rising each winter. Record cold temperatures are indeed being reached, it is just covered up by those who are so set on climate change being the ""impending doom of humanity"". In the past the planet has had many ice ages as many are aware of. These ice ages at some point melt with the gradual re heating of the earths atmosphere. Atmospheric change is something that has happened in the past and is now happening again. Everyone who wants to bang on about how we are destroying the planet needs to stop for a second and actually take the time to educate themselves on how it is normal for an environment as complex and diverse as our own, there will be change in its characteristics over long periods of time. Give it a few hundred years and we will be seeing ourselves in a global cooling period and the process will repeat itself. I do enjoy the videos you make, however I do believe your view on climate change is bias and you are not open to look at the natural explanations for the change in our climate."

The atmosphere is less dense on Mars, so even if the thin atmosphere has the same concentration as a thick one, you’ll get different results. Mars doesn’t generate a very powerful magnetic field, so if it got a thicker atmosphere it would just be blown away. So, those two things aren’t comparable."

"Aiden Potter","2019-05-09T20:44:06Z","Mike Jones I want to see your source. You’re definitely right that increasing co2 would increase crop yield, but only if co2 was the only thing increased. Because co2 causes warming temperature is also increased, meaning the plant will close their stomata for longer periods of time to retain water. So unless releasing co2 in the air causes the plants water and nitrogen supply to increase as well, the assertion that co2 causes plant yields to increase is, in practice, wrong.

I do really want you to address the Venus thing though, since it kinda shits on your entire argument."

The earth has not warmed beyond what is expected following the little ice age. According to NASA global temps have dropped over the past two years. But, who knows. Those folks have no qualms when it comes to manipulating the temp data to get a desired result and have been caught on several occasions doing just that.  People are still building real estate on the oceans shorelines and banks are still making loans for them to do so. More people continue to build in floodplains despite knowing that floodplains actually flood occasionally. Deserts are getting greener. No increase in hurricanes or their severity. The list goes on.

Live stock covers 45% of the world’s land and only 2% of wildlife left on earth. 91% of destruction in the Amazon rainforest is due to animal agriculture. Every second 1 acre of rainforest the size of a football field is cleared for animal agriculture. The amazon rainforest is the lungs of this earth. Domestic use of water in the US only makes up 5% while animal agriculture uses 55% of USA water. The meat & dairy industry uses 1/3 of earth fresh water. 1 hamburger is equivalent to 3000 liters of water which is then equal to  2 months worth of showers due to the water footprint of processed food. 1/3 of land is decertified due to livestock. 80.4 MILLION metric tons of fish are pulled from oceans each year. 3/4 of world’s fisheries are exploited. For every 1 kilogram of fish caught, there are 5 kilograms of unintended marine species are caught and classified as by-kill. Waste from 2500 dairy cows is equivalent to the waste from a city of 411,000 people. 80% of antibiotics in the US goes to animal agriculture. It is also said that in areas of poverty and starvation their land is being used for livestock to feed westernized countries.ANIMAL AGRICULTURE is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction. SUGAR is also the leading cause of obesity, all diabetes, and heart disease. Everyday each person is only to consume 25g of sugar per day and by the looks of it we exceed that number by a lot. Americans treat breakfast like dessert. Sugar is in everything you eat, take a minute to look at the nutrition facts on the back of the packaging. Free chocolate milks given by public school systems for breakfast and lunch of students contain the same amount of sugar as a can of coke. 1 out of every 3 people is either obese or morbidly obese. The population is said only to grow with more than 200,000 people born per day. Many mouths to feed. Yearly us humans consume 21 billion pounds of food and 5.2 billion gallons of water. While cattle consumes 135 billion pounds of food and consumes 45 billion gallons. Due to the PATRIOT act in the law we should not blame this on our government. Rather than come together for a solution. The solution is simple, and that is to create healthier lifestyle choices specifically diet and exercise. You can help save our world by becoming vegan. On a vegan diet you save 1100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq.ft forest, 10 pounds of CO2, and 1 animals life PER DAY. A little bit of sacrifice for the sake of humanity will be greatly rewarded in the future. It is up to you to make a conscious decision to make an impact in this world."

These greenhouse gas emissions have created a hole in the ozone layer which has caused a rise in temperature in the atmosphere (particularly over Australia due to mining) This is evidenced by the melting of the polar ice caps and rising sea levels from the increase in global temperatures. It is also evident in the bleaching of corals caused by a rise in water temperatures, which is also very evident in Australia, where the hole in the ozone layer is. Yes, the climate was hotter in Roman times due to natural climate change, but that was gradual change, and before the formation of some glaciers. This current climate change would have happened anyway, but due to the large amounts of pollutions and carbon emissions, it's speeding it up at an alarming rate that is very dangerous for us and everything on the planet. Instead of worrying about the Roman climate, how about you worry about our world, our people and our environment."

How the sun and the rest warm the earth is a thing we can discuss, when we stopped our own warming, because that's really a smaller issue. in the past, it was changing so slowly that the animals had time to change and adapt to the climate, but not when the temperature rises ba that much every year."

"Holly","2019-04-03T20:54:26Z","climate change is not just caused by the burning of coal, gas and oil.
animal agriculture is another big one - if not the biggest contributor of them all.
this is because animal agriculture does not just contribute with methane emissions that are 25 - 100 times more potent than CO2, but also in the destruction of our planets carbon sinks.
it is the leading cause of deforestation, ocean dead zones, desertification, water pollution and habitat destruction.
when it comes to loss of bio diversity, mass animal agriculture and the vast mono-cultures required to run it is without a doubt the one main cause.
any video about climate change that does not even mention animal agriculture is lacking research."
"Jim R","2019-04-03T18:29:27Z","The climate models have never successfully predicted observed climate, and objective science simply does not support the predictions of the models... namely that CO2 is a primary forcing agent of temperature.  The correlation is non-existent (except in the make believe mathematics of the models).  It's well known that CO2's warming effect rapidly diminishes as more is added to the atmosphere, and water vapor by far is the most abundant greenhouse gas.  CO2 is not a pollutant, it's essential for life.  Plants need 3 things to grow: sunlight/water/CO2... aka photosynthesis.  Most plants evolved during periods of significantly higher levels of CO2, as much as 5 times higher.  Each human emits about 800 pounds of CO2 every year simply by breathing.  After 150 years of all natural CO2 emissions (oceans/plants/animals/humans/volcanoes) plus CO2 from converting hydrocarbons to energy...  of every ten thousand molecules of atmosphere, only 4 are CO2.  Even the IPCC acknowledges the claim of ""extreme weather"" due to CO2 has no empirical support. The climate faithful understand so little of their own religion, yet cling with vigor to the belief their religion is somehow science.  On the other hand, people who practice one of the other major religions never mistake their religion for science, or vice-versa... it's a phenomenon unique to the climate faithful."
"brent butler","2019-04-03T14:14:59Z","1. Is the earth warming? - Yes
2. Is the earth warming from human addition of CO2? - Yes
3. Will this change lives of humans in the future? - Yes, some areas will be less fertile, while others will become more so. (Looking good Canada!)
4. Would I call myself a climate alarmist? - No


I agree with the principle of global warming and climate change, but I would argue that the effects of CO2 are exaggerated and some key things about how it interacts within the ecosystem are conveniently left out of most of these type of videos. Such as the effects are logarithmic and one hell of a stimulant for plant growth. (easy enough to look up)


With that said I am still in favor of limiting fossil fuel consumption, not because I think it is going to fry us all in 15 years(we were told this in schools in 1990).  We need to limit them because eventually we will run out, and without any other good viable ways to create the energy our society is so utterly dependent on, it will effect humanity in greater ways than the eventual warming of the earth."

It took a 42 percent increase of co2 in the last century to raise the global temperature by .8 Celsius. Now if you take our current situation we doubled the co2 ppm in this century.  From 185 ppm to now 400ppm. This promotes plant growth just as the one you by to use in green houses. Google it, co2 generators. Most plants thrive in 1500ppm of co2 and in  exchange provide oxygen. If this is not convincing do your own real unbiased research. So co2 is not the real problem it could be as simple as natural events on earth. Last one was 800,000 years ago. So now if you think about it this is a perfect reason for our governments to cash grab on this lie."

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCprclkVrNPls7PR-nHhf1Ow


The theory of climate change is flawed on the face of it.
CO2 emissions create the greenhouse effect.
Well
greenhouses grow plant life at a higher rate because of higher availability of CO2 and higher temps.
Plants consume CO2 when they grow so that would reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere and reduce the climate change greenhouse effect.
So burning fossil fuels improves the environment by making CO2 more abundant for plant growth.


And, if these climate alarmist actually wanted to do something about reducing emissions into the atmosphere they would be embracing nuclear power. Solar and wind are inefficient and in the long run create more more of a hazardous waste problem then they solve."

The planet is indeed warming, how ever the models that are supose to predict this warming are falling, and the real climate scientists that have been analizing the temperures of the planets of the last thousands of years, have came to the conclusion that the planet for example in the Mediaval age was warmer, in the last century alone the temperature have go down and up again, we had 3 different warming periods 2 of them can't be blame by the CO2 emissions that we humans make, there was just not enough, and that suggest that it may be cyclic, however i do defend that we should have if possible 100% of clean energy, is always better to the planet."

While renewables will make a significant contribution to our energy mix and help lift the worlds poorest living in remote areas out of abject poverty they can't power an advanced industrial civilization with that many people. Nuclear energy has the potential to power our industrial civilization without any carbon emissions. I would argue it can become the most environmentally friendly, safest, and cheapest source of electricity. But we aren't there yet and won't be for a while. So for now we are stuck with fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are also particularly well suited for many applications such as aviation, heavy construction and farm machinery,  and transportation in general. So where does that leave us? Basically with acceptance of climate change, and the need for mitigation and remediation of the damage that will be caused by the rise in temperatures. Climate change is here and growing, accept it, we can't reverse it, and probably not even slow it significantly. Were fooling ourselves to think so."

I am talking about mass animal agriculture at scale that makes an entire country appear in a checkerboard pattern when viewed on Google Maps.
the conversion ratio of feed to meat or other animal products is extremely inefficient.
if an equivalent quantity of crops would be grown for human consumption directly, much, much less space and other resources would be required."
"Jim R","2019-04-04T17:59:30Z","@Holly, animal agriculture is one of the few things that absolutely benefits developing, literally hungry, countries.   Any self respecting climate fashionista would also know that rice production in developing countries is the new fashionable target because of the related methane emissions.  Animal agriculture and rice have been the staples for human survival in developing countries for thousands of years... and remain so.  Fashionista's generally don't bother with minor details such as almost 1.5 billion people on the planet only have access to biomass energy (wood, cow dung...) and another 1.5 billion have no regular access to energy... combined that's more than a third of the population of the planet.  The policies your climate church promotes are advocating to keep the poorest and hungriest on the planet the poorest and hungriest... all based on speculation from the sacred climate models that have never successfully predicted observed climate.  

Now if you had said, well we don't actually have scientific evidence proving methane or CO2 are concerns, and we don't have evidence of catastrophic change because after 40 years and hundreds of billions of dollars of climate research our models are still very inaccurate... so we Should Not try to impose regressive policies that have severe impact on the poorest and really all humans except the ultra wealthy... but we should continue research and look for ways to limit methane and CO2 emissions, and we should consider not only the cons of cheap/reliable/available hydrocarbon energy but the pros and cons of all energy sources in the context of what promotes humans to flourish the most... and we agree that alot of what is peddled as climate science is really propaganda... if your church could say that, a lot of people could get behind that."
"Holly","2019-04-04T17:12:30Z","@Jim R I'm not sure about your conspiracy theories, but this is an entirely different topic anyway.
animal agriculture at scale is inherently unsustainable and does not benefit developing countries."
"Jim R","2019-04-04T16:34:43Z","@Holly, in fact that is exactly what is being suggested.  The rich western nations and their politicians have been trying to convince poor developing nations to not develop for decades. This started with the Kyoto Accords in the early 1990's where our leaders attempted to strong arm India and China among many other developing countries to not use the same sources of energy our countries had used to dramatically enhance our standard of living.  Climate policies are regressive in that they hurt the poorest the hardest.  When the cost of energy is increased due to carbon taxes or other related policies... that increase impacts the cost of everything such as food, clothing, housing (protection from the climate), health care, transportation...  Al Gore and Elon Musk will continue to fly on private jets even if the cost of jet fuel triples, but minor increases in energy are devastating for the very poorest."
"Holly","2019-04-03T21:36:24Z","@Jim R not sure what you are getting at. no one is suggesting to stop using energy or to stop producing food."
"Jim R","2019-04-03T20:39:56Z","I completely agree with your comments except the conclusion we will eventually run out of fossil fuels.  You should check out Alex Epstein's book ""The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels"" or some of his youtube videos.  He makes a compelling argument that advancements in energy technology continue to make it cleaner and allow us to find new sources... for example fracking.  Here is a recent article from CNN (as strange as it might seem) https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/business/us-oil-exports-saudi-arabia/index.html

Epstein makes the argument oil for example is not  a ""natural resource"" in the sense it required human intelligence to convert the raw resource into suitable forms of usable energy.  Prior to that time (pre 1900), oil was just a nuisance humans would find when digging for water.  Atomic energy is another example.  He makes the case the earth is full of potential forms of energy and its just a matter of technology evolving to allow humans to leverage it.

He also makes the argument, given current ""known reserves"" we have sufficient supplies of our current forms of oil, coal and nat-gas for many generations... and that is without the likely new advancements in energy production that are virtually certain to come."

"Peter B.","2019-06-15T16:40:03Z","@Ryan W well the article published by THE OLD FARMER'S ALMANAC said on thier website Global Warming is nonsense. I do wish it was still up so I could post the link. They can actually predict the weather fairly accurately up to a year in advance and maybe longer. They use an ""almanac"" a """"calendar of the heavens"" and present sky sightings and asltronomical data. Historical data. Because the earth goes around the sun and the moon goes around the earth. So the weather repeats itself. So The people at the OLD FARMER'S ALMANAC know what the weather will be 20 years from now from historical data not scientific research."
"Ryan W","2019-06-15T16:04:06Z","@Peter B. I agree there are people who are starving. But climate change is nothing normal and scientists predict those in poverty will be affected the most, because of the decisions of those in first world and industrial countries"
"Peter B.","2019-06-14T22:29:21Z","@Ryan W Climate Change is normal and there is nothing humans can do about it. There are poor people who are starving. Food is for people not making motor fuel."
"Ryan W","2019-06-14T22:04:24Z","@Peter B. Key word there being gradual. The rates at which the globe is warming are faster than anything the world has ever seen. Also, while over monumentally long periods of time the temperature could fluctuate between ten degrees Fahrenheit, the 3 degree celcius increase would raise the global temperature by more than ten degrees fahrenheit. Its unnatural, its threatening human existence and that of many other species, and if it isn't taken care of, then we may be living in the end times."

"Væringjar","2019-04-03T12:07:26Z","Riccardo Mazzia but if you know how to operate a thermometer, increase in temperature is a _notable fact_ and the byproduct of proposed solutions to that empirical fact is cleaner water, cleaner air, less heavy metals, less ocean acidification, less coral bleaching, less natural habitat destruction, decentralisation of energy production. All these things might not affect you personally, but your actions do negatively impact the rest of the globe. And you have the nerve to call me a hypocrite?

So to take up all of the emissions from 2010 (which the data was from) you would need 1,545,000,000,000 trees. A forest has only about 100 trees per acre, so you would need 15,545,000,000 acres of forest. This equals an area of 62,910,000 km2. This is approximately the land area of Asia, Europe, and Australia combined.

But it certainly doesn’t hurt to plant more trees, and more importantly, letting the trees we already have grow."

It has always changed. CO2 is not the driver behind warming. Fifth grade science does not explain the complexities of a planet's climate. We do not know fully what affects climate.
What we do know is that CO2 levels are low when compared historically.
We know that the planet has been warming for thousands of years.
We know that glaciers have been receding for a few hundred years.
We know that sea level has been rising for centuries
And we know that ""human caused climate change"" is a scam"

"Elias Birgersson","2019-03-22T22:59:45Z","Both sides exaggerate, A LOT, all I know is that I have read scientific reports saying that we should more or less already be dead for over a decade ago, I have also seen people completely deny the effects of carbon dioxide. Clearly, co2 has an effect on the climate, but clearly, it isn't as much as a lot of people will have you think it will. Even this video uses statistics very incorrectly ""60% of wildlife has gone extinct"" which is not because of global warming but mostly from pollution and hunting. If we look at the big picture, because never do PSAS as these do, they never give you the science. 
we are at roughly 400ppm co2 in the atmosphere, would we go below 280 ppm then we are going to die, not just us but all life on earth because photosynthesis ceases to function. the other extinction level event because of high co2 was at roughly 8000ppm. this tells us that we are 7600 ppm from death if we go upwards and 120 ppm from death if we go downwards. historically we have been at 8000ppm and survived and I'm taking my chances there and having only gone up roughly 13ppm, new designs and a lot of energy based technique and motors being developed. we are not going to reach 8000ppm, what we might reach though depending on the very many different natural systems we have on earth which lowers co2 is something lower, and we are very close to extinction. In fact, we have never been this low on co2 in the history of the entire planet. sure we have gone up by 13ppm but we have also gone down by several thousand. co2 definitely affects the atmosphere, not nearly as much as one would think, or like I used to think."

They want to just limit the amount of CO2 emmisions allowed tremendously and hope it'll fix everything. Doing that would probably wreck the economy. What we should probably do instead is a gradual switch over to other energies, and promote companies like Tesla who are working on making electric vehicles more affordable and commonplace for everyone, even if they aren't now. We should probably also focus more on nuclear energy, which has a tremendously small amount of waste product for the energy output as opposed to most other forms of energy. These things together could make the economy stronger along with the environment, instead of having an inverse relationship."

Take Iceland for example. They are 100% renewable. Like no fossil fuel at all. They get there power mainly from geothermal. Apparently way back when they realized that importing oil to heat ther homes was too costly so they took the time and money in finding a solution that worked for them. There scientists realized that they could make there country's unique geography (aka volcanoes) work for them. Now all homes are heated with geothermal energy. Along with hydropower, they have become 100% renewable.

Now I understand that not every country has volcanoes but they can take what they have. Brazil has many rivers intersecting their country. Alot of their power comes from hydroelectric. If you want a USA example, Texas does ~20% of their electricity from Solar and Wind.

It's time to change the conversation. Stop talking about reducing greenhouse gases and talk about investing in renewable energy.

No. Not eating meat hardly hurts the corporations sales that do contribute to GB via ranching. Instead of being vegan you should something to stop that. The only problem is that agriculture too contributes to environmental problems. Agriculture uses pesticides and fertilizers that can be washed off into a nearby river or lake. Even ""organic"" foods cause a problem. They take up tons more space which is a problem in a society that is growing and requires ever increasing living quarters and food. Using no fertilizer in farming gives less crop yield per acre than regular farming. The larger the space needed to produce the same amount of yeild requires MORE FOSSIL FUEL usage. You might be thinking, ""Just use electric vehicles."" That is a good idea, but that would mean that we would need to burn more fossil fuels to charge the vehicles. Renewable energy isn't very effective so you would need to put in a lot of solar, wind or hydroelectric, taking up even more space. Maybe we could find a way to reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned via agriculture or ranching by doing something about it?"

""Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been over shadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields.

For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.

The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.

Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.""

The point of a carbon tax not simply to limit CO2 emissions, but to make an economic incentive for energy companies to innovate and diversify their portfolios. Simplistic cries of ""wrecking the economy"" are just another line of oil company propaganda; if they can convince the public that their personal finances are equivalent to the economy as a whole, they're sitting pretty."

"Gabb1","2019-03-21T14:12:28Z","@AsapSCIENCE
So so so so so much misinformation in this video all I can do is facepalm.

Look, I'm 40.  They've been pushing climate change since at least around the time I was born.  They said back in 1989 that if we don't do something in 10 years we're doomed, the ice caps will melt, food will be sparse, etc etc.  Well 10 years goes by and then another 20 years on top of that and things aren't any different.  Now it's ""if we don't do something in 12 years we're doomed"".  How many predictions of doom do we have to go through that don't even come within a nuts hair of coming true before we finally say, ""hey, these guys really don't know what they are talking about""?  I can promise you 12 years will come and go and nothing will be that different.  In fact, I'm willing to put on record that ice caps will grow and it will get colder.  Hell, it's already happening.  We've seen snow in the Arizona deserts.  MASSIVE snow falls in the mountains.  Utah has received almost 200% of it's typical snowfall this year.  The midwest had snow on May 10 last year.  There was basically no spring.  Winter extended much longer and it broke immediately to a mild summer.  

Sure, it's gotten a LITTLE warmer over the last couple decades, but nothing outside of natural variability.  Ice caps are still there.  In fact the Arctic is growing, slightly.  Antarctica was at an all time maximum in 2014.  Nobody ever talks about that though because it doesn't fit the narrative.  The Arctic was reduced by the same amount if not more during the 1930's and 40's, then grew back during the 60's and early 70's.  There are way more days recorded in the 30's and 40's over 90 degrees, 95 degrees and 100 degrees than the past 2 decades combined and doubled.  It's mostly a lie folks.  Yes we do cause some warming, but we don't have a clue how much and the more we study, the less it appears we do.  Exxon scientists were not 100% sure of anything.  They believed it because they started doing the study right out of a dip in our climate and when they saw warming in correlation with the C02 output they said, yep we're doing it.  However, the understanding of our sun, cosmic rays etc and how they affect cloud cover etc, was not understood at all during that time, as well as a myriad of other things that effect the climate.  The science wasn't there for them to be able to understand exactly what was happening.  IN FACT 30 years later we still don't have the science to understand everything.  The IPCC even admits to that.  

I want to pose a question to you and you tell me what is more likely.

A group of companies KNOW we are destroying our planet and chose to hide these facts in pursuit of short term monetary gain but causing absolute doom to it's company and all the people/animals/planet

OR

A group of people are making up fake claims of doom for political/monetary gain, KNOWING full well there's not immediate doom but also know they can get a power grab in this way?

Before anyone starts saying ""yeah right, 97% of scientists are all in on a scam, your so full of it""  know this.  That 97% claim is bogus.  That number was reached by scouring papers that talked about global warming.  Out of those they only included papers that gave a position on whether or not it was man made.  Out of all the papers scanned, only about 36% of the papers took a position.  OF that 36%, 97% said it was caused by humans, BUT they didn't say how much.  It ranged from very little cause to totally caused.  64% of the papers took no position, but they claim 97% agree.  Total garbage.  A actual more recent poll was done of 1,821 meteorologists and only 52% claimed it's caused by man.  Only 37% of those that actually do weather predictions claimed man is the cause.  So as you can see, there is NO consensus.  It is very much a topic in debate."

Back in the 70s-80s articles were released saying the next ice age was going to happen in the 2000s. You idiots call yourselves “scientists” and say that climate change is caused by humans, hands down, no more testing or evidence needed, and if I oppose it I’m a denier. Wow! that’s definitely how science works! My weatherman can’t tell me if it’s going to be sunny tomorrow but he figured out our warming trend is caused by humans, and not say, the idea that the earth naturally cools and heats over long periods of time do to things like sun spots. Believe humans are the cause of “climate change”? Alright! You want to hear the real cover up behind climate change?
The political left and the Democratic Party have used the argument that humans are the cause of climate change to punish big corporations, put a stop to our oil industry, and basically destroy capitalism entirely for a new wave of “democratic” socialism. Let’s take a look at one of the main figures leading the left, AOC. She proposed a “New green deal” which wishes to get rid of all combustion engines (your car), planes, and FARTING COWS (I wish this was a joke) by 2020 do to the evil effects of climate change. Also repair and remodel every single building in the United States to be “energy efficient” (Including your home!) To do this her and other leaders on the left want to... you guessed it! Tax those evil corporations who are literally making money off the industry they wish to destroy! Makes so much sense doesn’t it? 
I’m sorry, but if you believe humans are the main cause of climate change, hands down, with no other explanation you have no right to call yourself a “scientist” just because you got a degree at some leftist loon college where your professor taught you the glories of socialism and communism, two economic system which have led millions to death and poverty. 
If you do still believe that humans are the cause, hands down. Please take into account that 
A. The United States is not the leading producer of Carbon or pollution, China is.
B. Just because you stop drinking out of plastic straws, become a hippie and destroy corporations and capitalism doesn’t mean the Chinese and other counties also will. 
C. The best way to produce less fossil fuels in innovation. As technology SLOWLY increases, we will EVENTUALLY rely less on fossil fuels. 
In conclusion. 
Climate change is propaganda from the political left. 
If you believe humans are the cause of it, a free market is the best way to stop it, not government control. 
If you disagree with me please leave your hate comment below calling me a racist, evil, capitalism loving, brainwashed denier."

Obviously not.  2, the climate is always changing.  Like since the beginning of time.  And if human actions effect it, then so does literally everything else.  The act of being on the planet means you're effecting the climate.  3, even if the US went 100% carbon negative, we still would not be able to stop the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.  4, the greenhouse effect that has been calculated is rumored to have been arrived at using flat Earth physics and grossly overestimates the effect on the atmosphere.  5, the majority of the weather and the climate is determined by the interaction between the two most abundant fluids on the planet: water and air.  Trying to predict the results of that is like trying to balance a pencil on it's tip.  And lastly, the very people who are dedicated to observing and predicting the weather (it's kinda like a climate slice) can't even get their predictions right a week in advance or even get it near correct with live data!  Add that on top of the fact that every (literally every single one!) climate disaster prediction has not only been markedly false, but nowhere near accurate.  I've been fed the lie of climate doom since the day I was born.  Now, 30 years later, I can see that on the grander scale NOTHING HAS CHANGED!

If you must insist that the ""science is settled"", you have to come to one of two conclusions:
1, these scientists don't actually know what they are doing and have been feeding everyone lies for 4 decades.
Or 2, these scientists know EXACTLY what is going on and refuse to tell everyone."

I'm going to bring the discussion back to my original point, this isn't an emergency. This is not because ""let someone else deal with it,"" because we are facing the repercussions already. This we can deal with as it is, the point at which we wont be able to deal with it is many years away. This does mean ignore the problem and let someone else deal with it. It means we can deal with in a reasonable way, which we are. Additionally technology is changing, for example, within 30 years it is likely that most vehicles will be electric. The list of things like that is endless, not literally of course. My point on this is that this crippling the economy to stop emissions is not a good idea.

Don't get me wrong, I think there is much more the US can do to reduce emissions in a non reckless manner.

e"
"Badly Drawn Turtle","2019-03-25T04:23:31Z","@Leonhard Euler 
First off, you're moving the goalpost. I used China and India because YOU used China and India, in your claim that other countries are not doing their part while the US is. What you speculate might happen to those countries in the future is irrelevant; your claim was phrased as being about the present state of world emissions.

But just developed countries? Okay, we can play that game. Of the 36 developed countries recognized by the UN:
Canada produces the most, at 16.9 tons per capita per year as of 2017.
Next is Australia at 16.5.
Then Luxembourg 16.4.
These are the only three that are more polluting than the United States, which puffs out 15.7 tons per capita per year. The rest:
Estonia (13.7)
Iceland (12.2)
Japan (10.4)
Czech Republic (10.3)
Netherlands (10.3)
Germany (9.7)
Belgium (9.1)
Norway (8.8)
Finland (8.5)
Poland (8.4)
Austria (8.3)
Ireland (8.2)
New Zealand (7.8)
Slovenia (7.3)
Bulgaria (7.0)
Slovakia (6.9)
Greece (6.5)
Italy (6.1)
Spain (6.1)
Cyprus (6.0)
Denmark (5.9)
United Kingdom (5.7)
Portugal (5.5)
Lithuania (5.3)
Hungary (5.2)
France (5.2)
Switzerland (4.7)
Malta (4.4)
Croatia (4.2)
Latvia (4.1)
Romania (4.1)

There are plenty of options for lowering emissions in the United States, Nuclear power among them, as demonstrated by the 32 other developed countries that already do it better, including a significant number who emit less than half of what the United States does per person.

Again, I'm waiting for an HONEST response. Haven't got one yet."
"Leonhard Euler","2019-03-24T15:36:01Z","China and India are developing countries. They dont have the regulations that the US has, so as these countries fully develop their emissions will be much greater. 

If you want to significantly lower the emissions (right now) in the US the only viable option would be to use more nuclear power."
"Badly Drawn Turtle","2019-03-24T12:27:02Z","​@Leonhard Euler 
Ah yes, cherry-picking the nicest looking numbers; a tried and true tactic. Levels in the US were unsustainable 30 years ago; they have since gone down SLIGHTLY, and are still unsustainable. Here's another, less convenient, fact: China has 4 times the population of the United States, but only produces twice the CO2 pollution; that means per head, China is actually twice as clean as the United States is. India has 4 times the population of the United States... and produces HALF the CO2, making it 8 times as clean.


I look forward to your HONEST response."
"Leonhard Euler","2019-03-24T06:57:03Z","These are actually current issues that are being felt with, like sea level. We are dealing with shore protection and such, ""not a big deal."" 

But what I mean by not such a pressing matter is that the emission in the US have gone down during the last 30 years although there are an additional the number of people has gone up by 100 million. The reason for this is of advancements in technology and some government regulation. With that being said, the oceans are expected to rise 3 to 9 inches over the next century. And we cannot fathom the technology that will invented during that time, or even in the next 10 years. So to pass ridiculous regulations that will cripple the economy pointless. 

Honestly the best thing we could do now would be to put pressure on other countries, like China or India, to reduce their emissions. We can also continue the shore protection initiative that is already in place."

 It doesn't matter what the percentage of greenhouse gasses that CO2 accounts for due to feedback loops. Even relatively small changes cause compound effects. I already know you discount this for.. some reason. I guess the idea that such a small amount somehow being a factor just doesn't make sense to you. That is speculation on my part of course.


Hell I wasn't even arguing that, I was pointing out that your source for Canada being ""clean"" was wrong. The math in that **Opinion** piece was incorrect, so where they were arguing from was incorrect. If Canada makes even 1% of global emissions then they still create nearly 200 times more carbon than those trees absorb, once again according to the ""source"" *you* provided. You made the claim via presenting that piece, you need to back it up.

Using the same calculation, the “Big Four” polluters of China, the U.S., the European Union, and India, which together are responsible for a whopping 60 per cent of global CO2 emissions, release 10 times more CO2 than their combined land area absorbs.

The other 45% is white light and of that, about 30% of that is reflected back into outer space, which is what you would see from outer space looking back at the Earth. That should leave about 31.5% of the total light being white, to strike the Earth and be reradiated back into the atmosphere as infrared photons. That would mean 55% infrared photons coming in and 86.5% total infrared photons going out. As we increase secondary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,  we block more incoming infrared photons, slightly cooling off the planet.  Being there are more outgoing infrared photons than incoming, we should trap more outgoing infrared photons than reflect incoming photons.

It was always understood that industrial output would change the climate, it just wasn't clear weather or not light reflecting particulates would have a stronger forcing effect than green-house and carbon-gases. It was in the 50s that ~most~ people who specialized in the field of studying industrial outputs effects began to understand that carbon-gasses would have a MUCH stronger forcing effect and that the world would heat. ExXon merely confirmed this information for themselves, it wasn't new information, it just wasn't well known to the public."

The information has been out there for decades now.   And what?   Exxon suppressed knowledge that burning their product would cause more C02.  What else?  Anything?  I've seen nothing else.   What I mean is- what exactly do you think we would have done with that information back in the 70s given how little we've done with it today.  Today green alternatives make up a tiny fraction of what the world uses for power and there is zero indication we are close to increasing that percentage by any significant amount given the fact that we know one thing for certain- the world is not going to use less energy.  The world is aware. The cat is out of the bag.  Energy use continues to go up and today with our greatest level of technology we are decades away from a green solution. We were farther away in the 70s, unless you wanted to build more Nuclear power plants, and we know where the public was and is on that.  So I say...they lied.  So freakin what.

Would all the firms that has heavily polluted the world be interested in going clean energy and having their profit be gone? I doubt that.

But climate change, as Pres. Bush sr. said here, is very complex and cannot be fixed by one person or one nation solitary. So, at an early level of thonking about taki g on the task at hand they get a sense of overwhelm. Now, instead of feeling the existential dread and maybe paralysis of such a prospect, the instinctively distort what they are being presented with. The y are  not kettting it in i  order to mot have to deal with a task that would be very, very difficult anf would produce many negative emotions (because of frustratiin, slow progress, setbacks etc.) So the make the almost subconscious, preconscious, decision to rather focus on ehat has worked up till now, keep the system they are currently succeeding in running, and not trade it in for a potentially better future for others.

"The Designer","2019-03-20T01:22:10Z","In 1827 Jean_Baptiste Fourier first recognized the warming effect of greenhouse gases.

In 1859, John Tyndall did the original research on the physical properties of CO2.


The first quantitative estimate of the effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 on the mean surface temperature of the Earth was made by Svante Arrhenius in 1896.  

Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences
 ""Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a given Distribution of Relative Humidity."" May, 1967
Manabe and Wetherald were the first to include all the main physical processes relevant to the problem, using a model that was no more complicated than necessary to achieve this. This led to much more realistic simulations and enabled the results to be explained in terms of processes which could be observed in the real world. 
Manabe and Wetherald made a number of other discoveries. First, that the temperature of the stratosphere cooled markedly when carbon dioxide was doubled. This is the characteristic “fingerprint” of increasing carbon dioxide: the troposphere warms and the stratosphere cools, as we have observed over the last 50 years.

"The Designer","2019-03-20T01:21:03Z","Let us now talk about the multiplier effect. If we build breeder reactors first and use that electricity to produce solar panels, the BTU multiplier effect would be 2000*9=18,000 to 1. Considering a coal-fired power plant has a ratio of about 80 to 1, that figures out to be about 18,000/80=225 times the increase in efficiency. Doing so would flatten out the hierarchies of the world, creating vastly greater independence worldwide. This would accomplish exactly what the murderous communists attempted but badly failed at."
"The Designer","2019-03-20T01:20:23Z","Since there seems to be an issue with fossil fuels, the question is what to do about it. This is my answer. If anyone has a different solution, I'd like to hear it. Let's begin with BTUs out vs BTU in by the energy source. 
Corn 1.3 
Solar PV 9 
Natural gas 10
Windmills 18
Light Water Reactors 80
Coal 80
Hydropower 100
LFTR and TWR 2,000

Now, consider deaths per terawatt.
Coal 161
Oil 36
Biomass 12
Peat 12
Natural gas 4
Solar PV .44
Hydropower .10
Light water reactors .04
LFTR and TWR .003
As you can see LFTRs and TWRs are the most cost efficient and safest energy supply possible at this time. We should easily be able to reach $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour. That brings the price of everything down substantially. Building small mass-produced modular breeder reactors would also make windmills and solar panels exceptionally cost-effective. We could have the population producing the majority of their own energy leaving nuclear energy for industry. Or we can continue with this absurd global warming debate."
"The Designer","2019-03-20T01:19:04Z","As the atmosphere warms, the differential temperature decreases between the ocean's surface and the atmosphere, blocking the ocean from releasing its heat.  In addition, about half of the 37 gigatonnes of CO2 is going into the oceans, also blocking the infrared heat from escaping the oceans and preventing the atmosphere from warming as much as expected.  This is where 93% of the additional heat is being stored. This additional heat in the oceans will not only ­melt the ice caps but will allow vastly larger hurricanes to form and travel at much greater distances.  The imminent threat isn't sea level rise but a future of massive storm surges. This website gives a more detailed explanation.

An experiment that the night shift was told to run without warning upon arriving. An experiment that was not only already proven not to work but so badly botched prior to its execution that the reactor core was critical and had its coolant supply greatly reduced. An experiment that went horribly wrong when they tried to boost the already critical reactor's output during the experiment, something they absolutely weren't supposed to do.


The experiment? To see if they could shut off Chernobyl and use its residual power TO POWER CHERNOBYL. More specifically, to see if they could power its coolant system (that they had already reduced) in order to cool the core (that they made critical) in the event of a power outage (because it was designed so poorly that it would take over a minute to do this without this idiotic workaround).

I’m not saying we should continue with what we’re doing right now, involving carbon emissions and fossil fuel extractions. I’m saying I think that governments should try to invest more into generating green energy (for example, using solar panels). But some won’t because while industries are based on fossil fuels, which would ruin the respective country’s economy. Which is a total bummer, but eventually (if we decide on nuclear energy) we’ll have to sacrifice some animal species at the expense of our well-being."

Exxon gets oil to make gas because that is what is the money maker and if you want to argue anything different you are the one that is either ignorant or disingenuous.  
And no plastic or oil is not equivalent to drugs but the point was to put your ""free to do what they want with the product"" cop out in another light. The seller has plenty of culpability in what happens to their product as they are the ones that are putting it out in the market. Not ALL the blame sure, but not none of it either."

Nuclear is however only a short term solution due to current mass amounts of nuclear waste. Fusion is much more efficient and safer method. Today we have elements such as Thorium which uses a helper (plutonium) to make power. If something goes wrong they pull a cork in the reactor and the reaction stops. Overall back then nuclear energy was easily a danger but today we know more and are able to keep our reactors from meltdown in most situations."

Sadly, this must be why this video suggests things started in 1982.  10 years later they reverse direction.  This means there was not enough data to make sound statistical conclusions; a 180 degree turn and BTW all reports were ""peer reviewed"".  By the 90's there was a short term warming trend and Al Gore was born.  By the 2000's there was another cooling trend, and Antarctica started gaining ice.  The ocean has risen 400 feet in the last 15-20,000 years, maybe a few more inches are coming.  https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/gornitz_09/  Focusing on  100 years of a 20, 000 year graph is 0.5% of data, statistically insignificant considering what has happened.

Spoiler alert, high priced plastics and lubricants will be the future of the oil industry, with a heavy reliance upon plant sourced hydrocarbon chemicals. The problems of pollution are more easily seen in the water. Ambient plastic (from the same source as fuel) is more directly responsible for the mass extinction event than any other human input to Earth. The higher prices must be demanded, to justify clean up work at a living wage. The IPCC uses a model that blames humans for temperature variations caused solar input. Basically, don't echo any political party if you're interested in science. You can educate yourself from the info made public by close to 1 million scientists, or 3%, rather than the 97% who calculate information from the same source that doesn't recognize any solar variation.

"6 subs with 0 vids?????","2019-03-17T23:03:51Z","I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but this is straight up fear mongering to push your political agenda. The current debate isn't whether or not climate change (which you use as a synonym for global warming) exists. The current debate is whether or not we in America should have regulations that damage our economy in exchange for the little impact it will have on the Earth. 

Why do I call it fear mongering? Because you describe the heat the Earth conserves in a day in terms of atomic bombs, predict disastrous consequences which aren't backed by the whole scientific community, and mention that 60% of the worlds creatures have gone extinct (illustrated with pictures of mammals) even though the great majority would go extinct because of natural conditions (living things go extinct by themselves). 

Why do I call this pushing for a political agenda? Because you mentioned the Green New Deal, a bill which people who sponsored it don't even want to vote on because they know it doesn't work as its nothing more than a trillion-dollar destruction of the American economy, banning of nuclear power, extension of government power and bureaucracy, and transition to a socialist economy during the next 10 years. Even if the US cut down CO2 emissions massively the total effect on the world temperature is calculated to be around -0.02° C. 

With all this said, I'm not defending the acts of certain companies. If we're going to fight climate change we need to stop relying on the government and start campaigning for increased research in new and improved technologies. People need energy and they need it for cheap, otherwise they'll go broke and they'll care even less about the environment when they can't even afford to take care of themselves. Stop pushing for bans and regulations when the current state of technology isn't good enough to stop CO2 emissions while mantaining the economic order in the country."

"Misk","2019-03-17T18:09:22Z","My only issue is that there's only really a consensus when you ignore the papers on climate change that were uncertain. ~12k papers on climate change were looked at, and ~7.9k had no opinion, or were uncertain. So it's less of a scientific consensus, and more like 2/3 of all engineers shrugging their shoulders when asked if the bridge was going to collapse, or not.

Among the 97% who took the stance that man-made climate change is real, 2910 out of the 3974 said that man is causing less than 50% of the warming. Which is more like 73% of engineers thinking the bridge will collapse just from natural causes

It doesn't change that we still need renewable energy for the sake of having an energy source for if we manage to burn through all of our oil, though. It's just that ignoring a few massive details like this feels disingenuous, and calls into question everything else that's used to prove man-made climate change. Especially when scientists at NASA have been told to fall in line with the scientific consensus to avoid any ""PR Headaches,"" that they would have to deal with.

In the end, there are climate change deniers, because how shadily some of the data is handled, and used. Misuse of information, and influence to force a scientific consensus, rather than allowing that consensus to form naturally will cause push back no matter what side you're pulling for."

The trouble with these irritating, childish little pipsqueak clips are often from brainwashed millennials who - along with all the other little girls and boys who skipped double maths to congregate in advocacy for tyrannical global policies - have been duped into third-world-crushing proselytism for a global carbon price floor, mistaking it for saving the planet. The irony, unfortunately, is lost on them.

These children are sadly parroting a dogma in support of the postmodern coup that is engulfing science generally, but more worryingly, climate science. They are the latest product of an educational system that has targeted our sons and daughters to become neo-Lysenkoist, doomsday cultist, marching-in-lockstep (or is that goose step?) mouthpieces for government misinformation that would have us all believe we're heading to hell in a super-heated hand-basket unless we part with our cash now and enact ruinous policies for decades into the future. Witness the green new deal manifesto of AOC: Utterly wealth-destroying, Marxist policies that will further impoverish the already impoverished and punishingly so.

In the big scheme of things it isn’t that much. The earth since its existence has gone on natural heating and cooling periods. That’s why in the 70s while this research was being done we were actually cooling. The effects are not as extreme as desertification. It will not affect climate of anywhere but the arctic. The ice caps melting would cause a rise in sea level but with more and more technology being created we will make innovation to combat that. Climate change is truly made to get people mad at the government and oil companies to create chaos. It’s not as bad as you think it is. Maybe we should ask the question of why people in power bring up climate change to the public? Do they have a vested interest in electric car companies? Maybe they hold stock in wind/solar energy? Truly the minimal damage we have done can’t be stopped because our economy relies too heavily upon fossil fuels for industry."

Somehow this debate is always engulfed in politics and I hate that because it really doesn't do any good for either side. The green new deal has a lot of flaws and it way too forceful for most peoples liking. In the other hand denying evidence of climate change is counter intuitive. We need to educate people with the facts and let then make their own educated decisions and not let politicians take advantage of the miss information and play them to their hand. 

There are a lot of factors in to global warming. Not just co2 emissions but the loss of ice in the arctics also causes a change in albedo and the darker water compared to the ice absorbs more heat speeding the process up. There are a lot of factors to consider and for an everyday person like us it is hard to get all the information in a topic like this. We need more objective educational videos.

Whether we're on the brink of the annihilation of humanity or not, there are plenty of forecasts by reputable scientific organizations explicitly declaring that there are critical problems opening up as a result of climate change, which will have potentially devastating effects. This is well-documented and agreed upon by academia. Also, you're only making yourself less reputable by throwing out terms like ""virtue signal"" and ""group-think."" Being spoon-fed these phrases and buzzwords by right-wing pundits and reusing them is pure group-think in itself, as are the talking points you're using.

My position is that there are many factors attributing to the climate that have an effect of which CO2 plays a role but not a dominant one.  Milankovich cycles, solar flares, procession, land surface changes, cloud cover.  We should be responsible in our outputs, take care of our trash, develop better cleaner technologies, but to villify this one molecule that takes up a tiny tiny part of the atmosphere and blame it for all the warming and future catastrophy is a stretch in my opinion.

"Gary Wiseman","2019-03-19T03:34:53Z","Chip Knows Nature isn’t putting out CO2. It’s already out there. We take sequestered carbon and burn it, adding to the total CO2. Yes, we put out less new CO2 each year than is already in the atmosphere. Thank goodness. Imagine if we put out enough CO2 to double the total amount every year. We would recreate Venus very quickly. Over the last 70 years, we have increased the CO2 levels from 250 parts per million to around 425 parts per million. We will have doubled the total in less than 100 years. We know the current levels are higher than any time in the last 800,000 years. How? We can measure the atmosphere captured in tiny air bubbles that long ago. Every measurement shows a much lower amount of CO2 than we measure now."
"Gary Wiseman","2019-03-19T03:28:43Z","Chip Knows Hi Chip! CO2 contains the carbon you list, and the oxygen you missed. Twice as much oxygen, which is why it is O2. The oxygen is already in the air. Burning a gallon of gas creates ~20 pounds of CO2. An 18 mpg car creates more than a pound of CO2 per mile driven."
"Chip Knows","2019-03-18T05:38:36Z","@mgammeren Agreed Methane is out there and there is a lot more coming from the permafrost if the earth continues to warm.  Methane absorbs wavelengths that overlap with water vapor so its contribution is minimal, it  also breaks down pretty quick into CO2 in an atmosphere with water(so I have read) leaving us back at the CO2 question.  Water vapor is the biggest greenhouse gas by a huge margin being measured in percent of the atmosphere rather than parts per million.   Send me some of the 90% science that causes damaging warming without a water vapor feedback loop included.  Question: if a degree of warming from CO2 is so bad itll cause catastrophic damage why wont a degree of warming from water do the same and kick off the same water vapor feedback loop?  No one is talking about regulating water.  Look back at the earths temperature for millions of years and it stays within a 20 degree F and 10 degree C range... because we have a planet covered by water that buffers itself to the extremes using water vapor. Congrats to CERN for the Higgs, but what does this have to do with the climate? A following study by other scientists could prove Cern wrong.  It isnt settled, it never is. Science follows evidence not consensus. Thanks for engaging!"
"Chip Knows","2019-03-18T04:55:29Z","@Gary Wiseman Ok Lets look at that.  A gallon of gas weighs about six pounds.  Most cars get about 17 miles per gallon so thats about .35 pounds of total fuel per mile.  That includes the all the components of the gas not just carbon. Let me know if im wrong but the basic math doesnt support your claim.  just some napkin calulations but let me know what you think.  That being said I agree we put a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere but according to the IPCC table 3: Global natural and anthropogenic sources and absorbtion of greenhouse gases in the 1990's: Natural sources of CO2 are 770,000 million metric tons of gas, Humans introduce 23100.  Nature puts out a lot more.  IF CO2 is the driver how are we the bad guy and not nature?"
"sargeantsimon1","2019-03-17T08:49:18Z","It takes time for the CO2 in the atmosphere to take effect. Reducing - or even eliminating - the pollution we as humans create will not save us from climate change. There's already enough CO2 out there to cause the severe problems we're expecting. We need to take strong action not just to reduce emissions, but also to clean up the damage we've already done."

Global warming is real, but humans are too small to make a major difference. If humans never existed, the Earth will still warm up, cool down, and so on. Humans aren't a substantial factor global warming, rather it is a coincidence that we humans are living in this period of time where the Earth is warming up. Humans have only been a part of this world for a minuscule amount of and we can only do so much in this short period of time we have been existing. I'm no scientist, but hey, that's just a theory."

The whole “97% consensus” is wonky and shady statistics when you discover how the number was actually calculated... it’s really eye opening.

Search YouTube for Lord Christopher Monckton 2014 NIPCC, he gives a presentation during the international conference on climate change, along with Dr. Roy Spencer."
"mhill","2019-03-16T20:27:11Z","Uhm. Search YouTube for Dr. Roy Spencer climate change hoax. He’s an actual climate scientist and literally has developed and continues to gather the climate data and he says “man made” climate change apocalypse is total alarmism...aka a hoax. He literally calls it a hoax.

The IPCC has 72 members, they’re the ones pushing for global carbon taxes bc of man made climate change concerns. The NIPCC (non government international panel on climate change) has 32,000 scientist who disagree with the government agenda of man made climate change scare tactics, taxes, and regulations.

I understand you have a YouTube channel and you’ve done some research, but I urge you to hear the voices and legit arguments of the actual scientists gathering the data and analyzing the climate models...  rather than political pundits and magazine journalists writing and reporting on the climate change topic.

CO2 isn’t even a bleep on the radar when it comes to contributors to the global green house effect, even though CO2 is itself a green house gas. There’s just not enough CO2 in the atmosphere to affect a meaningful increase or decrease in global temperatures, methane and water vapor and other factors wayyyy overshadow any effects from CO2... even if you double the amount of CO2 today. “Zero times two is still zero” is what these scientists are saying because the percentage levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is like 0.001%, so even doubling or tripling it makes statistically insignificant effects on global temperatures. Rising CO2 levels aren’t a causal factor for rising global temperatures, it’s been proven that it’s hoax that stems from showing a correlation from a period of 30 years, but fails to account for all the other periods of warming where there was zero correlation with rising CO2 levels. Correlation is not causation, that’s like science 101 but it’s literally where these Exxon scientists got their idea from and where this climate change fear mongering continues to stem from. 
These scientists even debunk the whole “97% consensus” fallacy... when you find out how the number was calculated... it makes you go wwwwtttttfffff? Does anyone else know this? How do ppl not know this? This is wonky math and shady propaganda..."

One other point.....it wasn't Exxon that found out about climate change. The first paper on the effects of coal burning and co2 emissions was done in 1867. The common denial argument of ""well in the 70s everyone was told it was getting colder"" was never in fact the reality.

"sargeantsimon1","2019-03-17T08:35:42Z","A few reasons, but first it should be noted that in most of the world, flu vaccines are available to protect against the flu.


Getting beyond that, the biggest problem is that the flu isn't a single sickness caused by a single bug. ""The"" flu virus is actually a collection of many different kinds of virus, each of which is capable of evolving quickly thanks to its simple structure. Because of this, being immune to a single one of them is virtually no protection at all. Instead, scientists try to predict each year what flu strains are going to be the most prevalent and the most dangerous, then advise the creation of vaccines which protect against those strains. The first reason that it's so hard to vaccinate against the flu is this: if we are wrong about which strains to protect against, the vaccines offer no protection, and even if we're right there's still a good chance that a few other strains of flu will be going around.


But that's not all. Many people are a little confused about how vaccines work exactly, so I'll break it down here. Vaccines generally have three parts: the antigen, which is the sickness-causing agent (in this case the flu virus); a chemical bath designed to kill or weaken the antigen; and a substance or two designed to irritate the body just enough to hasten an immune response. Once the immune system mounts a response, it will be able to fight off the antigen, and in so doing your system will ""remember"" that this particular antigen is a bad thing that should be fought as soon as it is found in the body, and it will have a better ability to do so. There are four places this can go wrong, each of which is its own reason why flu vaccines are so hard, but these reasons also apply to other vaccines in most cases:
1. It takes time for the vaccine to take effect. If the patient is infected after getting vaccinated but before the vaccine takes effect, the vaccine will not be able to protect them.
2. Vaccines are preventative, they are not a cure. If a patient is infected before being vaccinated, the vaccine will not lessen the sickness.
3. The antigens in vaccines can, very rarely, cause the very disease they are meant to protect against. This is becoming less common as time goes on, and for many vaccines it simply isn't possible because the antigens used aren't even alive, but in other vaccines it is still a small possibility. Typically a disease caused in this manner is less intense and shorter than the full disease, because the antigens used are weakened.
4. Vaccines are not guaranteed to work. While they are usually effective, there are cases where a vaccinated person is still vulnerable to the disease, or has only partial protection.


Each of these four problems is made worse by the many kinds of flu virus. People who get vaccinated might think they're protected, but they aren't until the vaccine takes effect, which can take time. Because the flu is so common, they could easily get infected while going about their day, thinking they're protected when the vaccine hasn't had enough time to work yet. Or perhaps they were infected before getting the vaccine, and just haven't started showing symptoms yet. Flu vaccines need to be produced quickly once it is determined which strains should be included, so there's less time to figure out how to lower the chance that the vaccine causes the flu while still being an effective treatment.

A lot of this makes it sound like vaccines aren't that great, but on the whole, they definitely are. Still, they aren't perfect. I fully recommend vaccinating against everything we can, but I'm also not going to pretend that they're 100% safe and 100% effective because no treatment is. Still, vaccines are very close to that golden 100%, if less so for the flu in particular."

1. Areas which get more direct sunlight will be warmer and more temperate than areas which get less. This is why areas near the equator are warmer on average than other places.
2. The sun provides the earth as a whole with energy, both in heat and light.
3. The energy from the sun can be trapped within the earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases, such as CO2, which drastically increases the amount of heat retained in our climate.


That's pretty much all you need to know about the sun's effect on climate."

"bobhatesrainbows","2019-03-16T16:36:31Z","Except... 
There isn't a scientific concensus. There are several theories, few facts, and a lot of assumptions.
Greenhouse gasses could be a serious driving factor in global warming, but the earth is currently colder on average than something like 95% of history and we are due for a reversal (because the earth has followed this cycle since it was formed millions of years ago).
Also take into account that heat and greenhouse gasses are actually good for the planet (not us) as they both lead to more flora which leads to more oxygen and food which leads to more quantity and variation of fauna. Just because humans are weak and can't handle a few degrees of temperature change doesn't mean it's bad for the planet. 

It's time we stopped worrying about something we have little control over and start focusing on the things we can do. Like when the hell are we going to start colonizing and terraforming Mars? The earth is getting warmer, but if we hadn't overpopulated it in the first place it wouldn't be an issue (as in people could intentionally live in the cooler parts of the planet because there wouldn't be competition for these locations). 

Stop whining about climate change because Stephen hawking is right, one way or another the earth is going to keep getting hotter and the solutions may have a lot more to do with getting people off earth than trying to cling to a planet that wants to kill us."

The closest would be  nuclear power, but that would require being close to water, and more importantly, the fear of a meltdown.

Not to mention that both of those sources are inconsistent with power. The Republican party paints it in that light, quite simply because you cant get people to rally behind you if you say it exist but do nothing.

Assuming Earth has quite stable natural CO2 cycle, is it actually possible factories and vehicles (among others) produce so much CO2, they are throwing 6*10^24kg sphere out of balance?"

"Gino V","2019-03-16T12:08:50Z","You WERE lied to. There is ZERO correllation between CO2 and global temperature. Global temperature has averaged as much as 10 degrees celcius higher in the past billion years, plants are nowhere near their maximum greening capacity, the IPCC found that their own estimates of climate sensitivity were off by a factor of 7 times too sensitive, and the government's own data about what different policys' effects will be on global temperature has never produced a result of any significance. One last thing, 99.5% of the scientific papers DID NOT agree that climate change will have a near nor catastrophic effect. They agreed that climate change was in some part man made and that it is happening. The fact is that this is the opposite ""consensus"" as the consensus project calls it. The tactics used to obtain that consensus are dishonest and flawed. 

Yes friend. You HAVE been lied to, by the earth worshipping hippies who blitzkreiged our schools in the 60s with radical messages of self destruction for the sake of ""mother earth"".

Antarctica is the biggest continent on earth, it’s not going anywhere. The ice caps only hold 3% of the earth water, if they melt, who cares, nothing would happen to the sea level. China has pollution problems because they are not as developed and have a very condensed city full of factories, this problem doesn’t happen anywhere else. The western United States has frequent fires because we kicked the natives of their land, the native Americans had a very effective way of controlling forest growth using small brush fires, when that stopped the forest could grow uncontrollably and that leads to more dangerous forest fires. Humans don’t cause global warming, we prevent it, co2 emissions have actually gone down over time, they were higher in the medieval times when we didn’t have effective sewer systems.there are bigger problems to deal with than global warming!"

"Badly Drawn Turtle","2019-03-23T13:34:28Z","Remember, Hawking was a theoretical physicist who dealt mostly with astronomical objects, particle theory, and the nature of space-time. He was not a climate scientist, and not a social researcher. There is no climate model that has Earth uninhabitable a hundred years from now, barring a major meteor impact, or perhaps a detonation of all of the extant nuclear weapons at once. This isn't to say that there isn't a problem to be dealt with, but there's quite a difference between ""dangerous storms, droughts, and famine"" and ""literally uninhabitable we have to leave the planet"". Indeed, consider that anywhere else we went would require, in the short term, self-contained life-support stations, and in the long term, massive terraforming efforts; both of which could be much more sensibly put to use right here, with improved life-support systems for riding out severe weather, and ultimately the reversal of climate change and active control of our environment. Between adding an atmosphere to Mars and keeping Earth's atmosphere stable, I think the latter is a much more reasonable goal.


Hawking also thought that robots were about to take over; try not to idolize anybody as all-knowing."

And all science goes through a period of consensus. The periodic table was not accepted by all when it was introduced 150 years ago. Eventually there was a consensus, or whatever you wish to call it.

The fact that thermometers and satellites show the same trend, sea levels rising, permafrost thawing, blooms earlier, etc. means that the earth is in fact warming. The fact that burning fossil fuels emit CO2 and we contribute 100x more than volcanoes is astounding. The fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas is a... fact.

But after all these years, not one scientist out of all the worlds 97% can produce scientific evidence to prove climate change. If they could prove it there would be no debate as we all could verify and peer review their work. But they wont release their calculations, hence they run around asking people to believe, Believeee!!! they say. Ohhh do you think scientists would lie? 
Climate change is the only field of science that has become a religion. 
with believes and unbelievers. Not like the good old days when scientists would present their work to be peer reviewed before their work is recognized or considered to be true.


But us engineers know why they won't release their numbers. We know they cannot acutely calculate a coefficient the represent the amount of Co2 that will be absorbed out of the atmosphere as the greening continues.

"messman10","2019-03-16T07:34:40Z","You should edit or annotate this with a correction: the first paper to suggest a link to increased carbon-dioxide output and an increase in global temperature was in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius.

Svante Arrhenius thought the warming would be a good thing, but still. In a later paper he computed that mankind burning fossil fuels would cause global warming, and infact, was staving off an ice age. But the little tidbit about Svante Arrhenius thinking global warming was good is immaterial to your thesis, just kinda funny if you think about it.

So, the idea that burning fossil fuels would affect the environment was known before the Exxon scientists looked into it, and then confirmed it. Basically their deception and bad behavior is worse then you originally stated."

Which was all false bullship too, just like Global Warming is now, but at least it was based on ""some"" actual fact, the earth WAS cooling since the late 1800's, save for a Warm Spike in the 30-40's (aka remember the ""Dust Bowl""?).  Global Warming is 100% based on manipulated and false data by certain individuals at NOAA and NASA, and then everyone else just like zombies repeating it.  We know this for sure because NOAA and NASA data was much COOLER prior to the 80's, but the data now shows the same time periods as magically for some reason TRIPLE the temperatures.  We also know all this from ""Email Gate"" in which they admit falsifying etc. the data, and many other things, and otherwise that we know."
"Anthony Morris","2019-03-16T06:02:49Z","""90% of Americans did not know there was a scientific consensus on global warming"" The consensus is on the *warming*, not on the apocalypse. ""52% of Americans believe the threat has been exaggerated"" It has been. No scientist is endorsing the apocalyptic rhetoric. Left wing extremists are. ""Global warming and climate change is caused by our immense burning of coal, gas and oil for energy"" Perspective is important. Inexpensive energy is everything. It is the fundamental cost of every good and service. It runs the entire world and has caused living standards to rise on a global scale. Climate change is also caused by irresponsible and endless growth in population. It's caused by our relentless bulldozing of forests and jungles which inhale C02. Expanding cities causes more heat absorption too. 

Using Hiroshima bombs in your argument promotes hysteria. This is a common tactic. ""By 2100 rising sea levels will cost the world 14 trillion dollars"" This is total speculation and ignores that the cost to the economy to fight climate change is greater. The technological world in 2100 will also be unrecognizable. We might have the capability to terraform other planets by then. ""9 of the 10 deadliest heatwaves"" Why are they deadly? They're just heat waves. This is the rhetoric of hysteria. ""since the 1970's 60% of the wildlife has been killed"" This is just totally irresponsible. It's human encroachment and habitat loss that is sending animals to extinction not climate change. There are too many people on the planet. ""100,000,000 trees died in California in the past 10 years."" Once again this is a story about population and has nothing to do with climate. 

We also won't experience extreme droughts or desertification. Rising Co2 has proven to be beneficial for all plants, and stimulating agricultural growth. The agricultural industry has already recognized this phenomenon with higher yields. Desalinisation and pipelines will irrigate crops. It isn't going to stop raining either. ""Science is now trying to figure out how to clean up this mess"". This is why we need inexpensive energy and shouldn't be sending funds to the developing world in some kind of misguided attempt to repent. The capitalist West is going to solve climate change, not Indonesia or Nigeria."

It's consequently a fair question to ask why Exxon would then continue to drill-baby-drill.  The answer seems clear enough - the naked pursuit of profit - BUT neither Exxon's scientists' belief in AGW then nor scientists' belief now constitute the necessary proof to resolve the matter as 'settled science'.  Then, as now, AGW was a theory.  Then, as now, there was no empirically verifiable proof that human causes are heating up the planet.  Then, as now, the earth's climate was a system so complex as to defy any capacity to accurately model it over any extended period of time.  As such, then, as now, AGW remains an unproven THEORY.  The best climate models today running on the most powerful supercomputers can't consistently correlate CO2 emissions to observed climate behavior (specifically, no models forecast 'the pause').

Bottom line..  Exxon may indeed have covered up their scientists' theories about fossil fuel emissions and the earth's climate.  A pox on their house for doing so.  But those opinions do not prove - any more than today's climate scientists' opinions do - that AGW is definitively, predictably occurring.


And environmentalists only sow more skepticism with their repeated sky-is-falling bleats that the time for debate and discussion is over.  Until climate models can actually  start successfully modeling AGW the need for debate and discussion is more important than ever.  George Carlin has it right..

Not just because of climate change of course. We might manage to thoroughly drain all our *current* reserves of fossil fuels, but there are others that we haven't touched yet. The fossil fuel industry has a grand history of convincing governments to let them extract resources from more and more places, using methods that are less and less environmentally sound. And hey, we do need that energy right now, but maybe we wouldn't if we had invested in renewable energy.


But just for the sake of argument let's assume that humans can muddle by without any drastic drop in population until we do extract pretty much all the fossil fuels the planet has to offer. There are two possibilities from there. First, we have enough alternative energy sources to prevent widespread problems, but there will be power shortages until we can fully replace those fossil fuels with greater renewable energy infrastructure. The other option is if we don't have enough alternative energy, in which case... Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but we're looking at an apocalypse scenario. Humanity itself might survive, but the vast majority of it will be unable to continue without that energy."

Just in a single month (September) he used 30,993 kWh, as much energy as a typical American family uses in 34 months. In the 12-month period from August 2016 through the end of July, Gore burned through 230,889 kWh of electricity, including 66,159 kWh just to heat his swimming pool. The latter alone is enough, the report says, “to power six average U.S. households for a year.”"

Can you answer that question? i will answer for you! Its a fraud and a court determined that in a suit against dr tim ball! He sued tim ball for calling his hockey stick a fake,Tim ball said mann should be in the state penn not at penn state?  all michael mann had to do was bring his raw data to prove his graph was real, but he refused and lost the case!

At 6:20 you say global warming is caused by CO2 in the atmosphere. But you fail to mention that there are other greenhouse gases, one of them being methane mainly produced by cows while being 25 times as detrimental to the climate as CO2. The animal agriculture is responsible for at least 15% of all greenhouse gases which makes it worse than the entire transportation sector (all cars, ships, planes and trains combined).

And the sad thing is, the general public is ignoring this because it's their time to change. It's easier to blame the big evil corporations. Oh yeah and because ""hmmm... bacon""."

CO2 is a green house gas but before we give up more control to Big Oil by allowing Carbon Credits/Taxes and other Oil Industry scams, we MUST better understand solar weathering forces.

One of the points that asapscience reiterated is the lack of “debate” on this issue. This is mostly correct, but generally misleading. Yes, there is certainly no debate among the scientific community that climate change is real and worsening. Contrary to what this video might convey, most in the Republican Party would agree with this assessment. 

The “debate” does still exist with regards to both the imminence of the threat and the optimal course of action to address it. The IPCC itself projects rising seal levels to occur over the next 100 years, while others in the scientific community predict it to happen sooner. That certainly sounds like debate to me.

In another way, the “debate” is also focused on what to do about it. Is the government of the United States the best facilitator of emission reductions? Or are private, non-profit institutions? If the government has a role (which it certainly does) how big of a role does it play? Will enough everyday Americans pressure business to change environmentally unfriendly practices without the need for a government mandate to do so? Should the onus be put more heavily on developing nations, who constitute the overwhelming majority of harmful emissions production, to modernize their energy sectors? These are the questions that Republicans are asking. It is not denial of the issue of climate change. 

I am not excusing the negligent behavior of companies like Exxon or their profit-driven cognitive dissonance. Nor am I excusing any individual politician in the Republican Party who has willfully denied the existence of climate change over the years. I’d just rather not caricature half of the American electorate as ignorant or as harborers of malevolent intent. Instead, let’s engage in the debate that still exists, and use the fruits of that debate to inform both our personal actions and our votes. Maybe the answer lies in the collective ingenuity of the human race, and not solely in the hands of a government bureaucrat."

So, we changed the name to climate change, but it doesn't mean the world isn't warming.
When it comes to policies, limiting fossil fuel usage is key. Natural gas, coal, and oil all release greenhouse gasses. Alternate and/or nuclear energy has less side effects. Strangely, though, the real best (although shouldn't be our only) method of fighting climate change is to re-think the way we raise cattle. Ranching causes the most greenhouse gasses because, and believe me on this one, livestock farts. More humane ranching methods and more dung beetles to eat animal poop is the best way to save the world."

The increase of these greenhouse gases have destroyed the ozone layer resulting in more shortwave radiation from the sun to enter earth which results in more heat trap from the greenhouse gases. Deforestation is also another factor, when trees and plants are removed to make way for agriculture or urbanisation, the soil is exposed to sun light and oxygen, soil oxidation occurs and it release Co2 which is a greenhouse gases. There are many human activities that result in climate change like agriculture and urbanisation too but remember that the planet doesn’t need us to survive but we need the planet to survive."

So they changed the name to climate change because they weren't able to justify their earlier claims. Also the climate has always changed and will always change until we are able to have it bend to our whims.and it has been far hotter in the past ,even in recorded history before we had factorys and cars.

"Corbin Brooks","2019-03-18T17:24:08Z","Greg Arcuri

The 3 points you made about Republican voters MUST be clarified:

1) The majority of Republicans are in favor of his tariffs (seems like they like anti-free trade). And, a majority of Republicans agree with Trump’s America First economic ideals (I.e. economic nationalism)

2) The majority of Republicans approved of Steve Bannon, *a leader of the alt-right,* and his approval was strong until he had conflicts with Trump.

That seems like enough nuance. I don’t feel any way the facts don’t persuade me to feel. The majority of the Republican voters have approved of *all* of his policies, and that is indicative that Trump is the new standard for conservative principles. Facts matter."
"Greg Arcuri","2019-03-18T16:46:50Z","Corbin Brooks 

Sorry you feel that way. I was a proponent of the same worldview just a couple of years ago, but then I grudgingly forced myself to listen to conservative voices on the issues and found that they were far more reasonable and well-intentioned than I originally thought. 

I don’t want to devalue your viewpoint, but I would urge you to listen to people without preconceived notions. Please realize that people generally believe things for good reasons, and they aren’t just stupid, evil, or irrational. When you put it your way, there doesn’t seem to be any path to reconciliation or common ground between the left and the right in America, and forgive me for believing otherwise. 

With regards to the data on Trump approval, you’re right, Trump has governed conservatively in many respects. But his economic nationalism, his flirting with the alt-right, and his anti-free trade sentiment flies in the face of conservative values, and it’s foolhardy to think that most Republicans are fine with that. When a poll asks people “Approve or Disapprove” it leaves no room for the nuance of their actual opinion, so be careful using that."
"Corbin Brooks","2019-03-18T15:06:43Z","Greg Arcuri

I am sick and tired of this narrative that Trump hijacked the Republican Party, and that the victimized hopeful Republicans are simply along for his political ride. *9 out of 10 Republican voters approve of Donald Trump RIGHT NOW.* Understand the meaning of APPROVAL. They are relatively indifferent of how he has handled climate change. They approve of his priorities and ignore his denial of the facts. Republicans love the man. Trump is literally a culmination of controversial Republican policies that are finally being brought to the forefront. The majority of Republicans agree with his most controversial policies. The only reason he is so “controversial” to the American public to begin with is because of his rudeness. Trump is the epitome of conservative principles. A wall to keep immigrants out, tax cuts for the rich and a second-rate healthcare system? Sign them up!

Also the #1 reason that Trump won was not his opponent’s unpopularity. Hillary won the popular vote by more than 3 million. He won because of:
1) His appeal to The Rust Belt industrial sector (based on real or false promises).
2) Hillary Clinton’s lack of campaigning in crucial swing states.

And finally, this video is relevant because 1/3 of republicans still don’t believe in human-induced climate change which is pure ignorance."
"Greg Arcuri","2019-03-18T13:59:59Z","Corbin Brooks 

Please be careful using the 2016 election to measure Republican priorities. 

The #1 reason why Trump won most of the Republican vote was because of his opponent’s unpopularity. You’re right that climate change might not be the top priority for Republican voters. That’s why they’re willing to forgive Trump’s ignorance on the issue in exchange for conservative judges on the court, border security, tax reform, etc.

Let’s remember that Trump hijacked the party, and isn’t necessarily a representative of conservative principles. He was the better of two evils in the eyes of Republicans, and their support for him will always be in question.

I was trying to say that just because someone doesn’t agree with the idea of massive government intervention in the economy (AKA the Green New Deal) in order to fight climate change, does not mean they are a denier. The video suggests that people are just ignorant due to the lies of big oil, and that they would otherwise support things like the GND."

"Elliot Smith","2019-03-17T10:10:59Z","sargeantsimon1 Firstly, none of the previous videos had, as far as I’m aware, had the owner talking into the video, which is more than 50% of this video & the owner literally adds that this isn’t their normal type of video at the end of the video. This video style is more in line with an SJW rant than a scientifically informative video when compared to the “Yanny or Laurel” or “what color is that dress?” videos. 

Secondly, climate change is a highly contested issue, not on whether it is real, but how to address it. Very few informed people believe massive government intervention is the way to tackle the issue, because governments tend towards inefficiency & corruption. The only real government intervention that would work is to add a tax to things that would produce global emissions, such that the market bears the true cost of gasoline & coal use (which is generally unchanged in free market because no individual directly bears the cost), but when you think of implementing such a plan, you will notice how may things can go wrong: What is the right tax to make the market bear the cost of global warming?; Would the government actually use the money to fix the emissions?; How would you prevent corruption in making these decisions?; What items should this include (cigarettes, BBQ, electric plants, matches, gasoline, etc)?; Government lobbying effect in making these decisions?; Etc. 

Additionally, many of these issues tend to be solved by technology & time in an non-government enforced market, as can be seen by synthetic beef, electric cars, nuclear energy, etc. when compared to government interventions (any previous government intervention you can point to). 

Lastly, here’s some videos to watch before you claim it’s an issue that needs to be addressed ASAP (especially by heavy handed government policies), as it’s important to be informed of both sides of the issue before you make a decision:

My whole childhood I bugged my parents about things they did that was making climate change worse. Smoking, driving too much, etc. I felt guilty everytime I got in my mom's car because I knew what it was doing to my precious planet. Fast forward a few years, and I'm struggling just to get by. I can't do anything to make a big change. All I can do is my part. Recycle, grow my own food, plant trees on my property, collect rainwater....oh wait, it's illegal to collect rainwater.

"VariantAEC","2019-03-24T22:42:44Z","@Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig 
You won't check my math but you know it's wildly inconclusive?
Right...

Well I did recheck my math and I discovered I did convert PPM to percentages correctly human tech and industry contribute about 1ppm annually since 2014. I also was able to work out how much volume 10,000,000,000 metric tons of CO2 looks like. The diameter of the sphere of all our tech and industries CO2 is about 21.8km. Human existence alone (globally) generates another completely different sphere of CO2 that is about 20km in diameter and is made up of our exhaled breath alone (assuming a whopping 0% of it gets absorbed into anything in the environment over a full year). So 7 billion humans just existing on this planet alone generates almost 1ppm by itself without any tech or industrial activity at all!

So yes after several days of toiling over the math it looks like it was right and all human activity including breathing contributes less than the equivalent of 2ppm to the current CO2 concentration levels. According to every source I provided CO2 doesn't live that long in the atmosphere. It's life is so short that on average most people in developed countries will live through 2 complete CO2 lifecycles. CO2 stays in the atmosphere for 30 years so if you are sixty any CO2 pumped into the air the day you were born completed its lifecycle on your thirtieth birthday and again any CO2 contributions on your thirtieth birthday completed its lifecycle on your sixtieth birthday.

The reality is that any CO2 we add to the atmosphere rolls off every 30 years so by 2044 even if humans increase our CO2 emissions by 100% the net gain in the atmosphere will be equivalent to less than 2ppm per year.

Meaning as a species we'll have to pump out 20 billion metric tons of CO2 (oh and 20 billion metric tons is the same amount as 20,000 million metric tons) to add still barely anything to the environment.

*AS PER USUAL NONE OF THIS MEANS I ADORE CO2 EMISSIONS OR DO NOT THINK THEY ARE A PROBLEM!*

I'm simply saying you are a moron for thinking that CO2 is driving climate change."
"Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig","2019-03-24T12:30:46Z","​@VariantAEC Look, I'm not even gonna check your math because you were _way off_ last time and if your calculations turn out to be inconclusive _again_ then maybe it's time you question your _own_ abilities instead of the credibility of _actual_ climate scientists. All I know is that the only number you got from me was 2ppm in 2014. That's it and it seems realistic enough to me.


You're not going to disprove a theory that is supported by a great majority of scientists around the globe by doing some ""simple"" math anyway. Like they didn't check the numbers themselves."
"VariantAEC","2019-03-20T07:37:43Z","@Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig 
Well at this point after looking it over again if we use your math, humans are emitting more CO2 into the atmosphere than there is atmosphere surrounding the planet! So I'm pretty sure my math isn't that wrong though I will concede that we contribute 10ppms instead of 1 as I jumped the gun converting those pesky PPMs from decimals. Anyway 10ppms per year CO2 stays in the atmosphere for 30 years an rolls off from their. Wikipedia's unsubstantiated data is just that it appears we burn the equivalent of 10,000 million metric tons of CO2 each year (yes, I said this multiple times and that is 10 billion metric tons of CO2 or 10,000,000,000 metric tons of CO2 or 1*10^10 metric tons of CO2).

So if we use your conversion method across the board, there is over 300 million km^3 more CO2 in the atmosphere than there is atmosphere. I provided all my links and everything I found to justify my calculations unless the CO2 volume per kg is or MIT's atmospheric volume estimates are wrong then nothing justifies there being more CO2 in the atmosphere than O2, nitrogen, methane and everything else that's in our atmosphere.

So according to another review my PPMs were off by a factor of ten which is no small mistake I'll agree, but the rest seems sound.
Now if we go with the estimated 813,395,543,150 km^3 is accurate (derived from NASA's diameter of earth 12,756km plus the thickness of the atmosphere 193km). At least then the math makes enough sense to leave more atmosphere than CO2.

But aside from that there's not much to report."
"Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig","2019-03-19T23:18:52Z","@VariantAEC It's not by _my_ standards it's by _universal definition:_ ""A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) And again: You can't say that some greenhouse gasses are worse than others and then say that the greenhouse effect doesn't exist. We went over this.


You didn't make a small mistake, you made _at least_ 2 pretty big ones and did the same thing _again_ after I already told you your math was wrong. 



Since when does a low concentration of something guarantee a small effect? Last time I checked many toxins are lethal, even in tiny concentrations. So what makes you think a few ppm won't have a significant effect on earth's climate?


And what's with that _""humans would need to pump out over 1,850 times the CO2 from 2014 to 2018 to even close in on the majority of that 411ppm""?_ You _do_ know that there has always been CO2 in the atmosphere, right? It just used to be in a lower concentration. Humans aren't the only cause for CO2, they just contribute an unhealthy amount. There's plenty of natural sources of CO2. 


And yes, in such a carefully balanced system, like earth, a tiny change in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere can have a drastic effect. If only a tiny fraction of the heat from the sun gets absorbed instead of reflected into space, that definitely has an effect on global temperatures. It's not like it's suddenly 400°C outside, it's just a difference of a few °C. But that's enough to cause a lot of trouble."
"VariantAEC","2019-03-19T11:00:48Z","@Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig 
Well by your standards GHG gases are gases that absorb the most infrared light yet according to the EPA, DoE, IPCC and NIST your belief was thoroughly debunked. Even as we see from the absorption charts I provided directly from NIST which show that infrared absorption alone clearly doesn't define what makes a good GHG.

So glad you corrected my math I always make a small mistake on my first go around and also I expected it to be wrong as I was getting results that made no sense however with your correction and deeper probing, retesting, updated arithmetic and new data covering Carbon volume at 21°C I'm sure humans still aren't driving climate change.

So basically humans contribute a whopping 5,460 cubic km of GHGs into the atmosphere back in 2014... Well according to MIT the total volume of the atmosphere is about 5.1*10^18m^3... Using this figure (and your updated conversion from m^3 to km^3) we see that the amount of CO2 that humans put their is....

Wait for it...



*1ppm*

YES, THAT's JUST *ONE PART PER MILLION* IN 2014.

Check my math:
5.1*10^18/1,000,000,000=5.1*10^9
5460/5,100,000,000=0.0000010705

If we round up we still get just 1ppm. Now remember that only 0.4% of the 5.1 billion km^3 of atmosphere is CO2 so 5460 km^3 is really a drop in the ocean so where are the other 410ppm of CO2 coming from?

According to this new math and a hopefully more accurate estimate of the approximate volume of the atmosphere from MIT (here: http://web.mit.edu/8.01t/www/materials/ProblemSets/Raw/editedf06PRS/PRS_exam01_combination_sol.doc )
So all of humanity contributed only 1ppm to the total 411ppm we currently sit at.

According to http://www.airproducts.com/Products/Gases/gas-facts/conversion-formulas/weight-and-volume-equivalents/carbon-dioxide.aspx
One kg of CO2 at 21°C an 1atm is 0.546 m^3 making that volume of CO2 in the atmosphere 1.0705ppms solid.
So with this more reasonable 21°C temperature humans would need to pump out over 1,850 times the CO2 from 2014 to 2018 to even close in on the majority of that 411ppm... Do you really think that's possible?

To put that into perspective we would need to use tens of thousands of times more fossil fuels than we do currently!

Now let's just say humans pumped out a net gain of 15,000km^3 of CO2 into the air which means we would miraculously need to more than quadruple our current global usage by the way! That would still only amount to slightly less than 1/1360th of the total 0.4% CO2 in the atmosphere!
*CURRENT PPM TODAY* as measured by NASA: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/

Scientists reacting to 400 PPMs in 2013: https://climate.nasa.gov/400ppmquotes/
Even according to Wikipedia known for peddling AGW now known as ACC (between only us) humans now emit 21.3 giga tonnes of CO2 per year, 
Quote: ""The use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes(21.3 gigatonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. It is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year."" That source is here: https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=environment_how_ghg_affect_climate
Somewhere... As I can't find that information on this page or any others!
So as of recently (about 2014) humans as a whole contribute about 1ppm of CO2 to the atmosphere per year with CO2 lasting for about 30 years in the atmosphere (source previously linked in another comment above I hope you are paying attention to those links I provided).

*So now that you know all of that.*
_Where do you think all the CO2 coming from and do you still think humans are driving climate change?_"

"Filip Pajak","2019-03-15T16:13:29Z","cyndie26 yes, but it doesn't take that many solar panels to power the entire world. It doesn't even take a lot of space. Just a lot of money and negotiation. Once all the energy needs are met by renewable energy alone, then it could be feasible to start replacing current vehicle with electric engines and producing new vehicles with the entirely clean source of energy. So I agree we should wait until most of the energy needs are being met by clean sources alone before mass production and replacement begins."
"cyndie26","2019-03-15T16:07:34Z","Filip Pajak But the thing is that it would be ridiculously expensive to do so without the use of fossil fuels, as we likely haven't developed enough alternative energy products to be able to do that... yet. Such actions would likely involve relying on mining practices that are environmentally unfriendly and making deals with possibly untrustworthy nations."
"Filip Pajak","2019-03-15T16:03:47Z","cyndie26 well we should be smart enough to create renewable energy devices like solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles etc. using the already established solar plants, wind farms, geothermal sites, etc.. most of the charging stations for EVs are hooked up to renewable power and if you're a homeowner with an EV you should make sure that your house is solar powered as well. We have the resources to make it happen really fast. It's just laws, bureaucracy, monetary-based economy, and capitalism that's probably going to prevent it from happening. Fossil fuel engines should be made illegal. That could solve the issue. And fossil fuel usage for future manufacturing of any product should be banned as well. We don't need all this shit anyway. We should be focusing on developing technology that works in tandem with nature and not against it. We could probably be really advanced like past societies if we regained our morality and healed ourselves from all our addictions inflicted upon us by corporate greed. We could probably be interplanetary if we just took care of our bodies, each other, and the earth, and then focus all our regained energy into higher pursuits like space travel and spirituality."
"cyndie26","2019-03-15T15:52:17Z","Filip Pajak No offense, but electric vehicles have a carbon footprint of a somewhat used car before it even leaves the production line and alternative energy products are made using fossil fuels.

"Justin Noker","2019-03-15T16:57:26Z","@aycc-nbh72 B: only reason for this is due to the large amount of fossil fuels still being used to supply the grid. A lot of solar manufacturers install their own panels to reduce impact, which would continue to lower as the grid gets cleaner

 Arvid Högbom, could be considered one of the first, and he made his discoverys in the late 1800s.  Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin also advocated for the carbon dioxide hypothesis. Wrote a book called ""An Attempt to Frame a Working Hypothesis of the Cause of Glacial Periods on an Atmospheric Basis"". It was also proven around that time different chemicals, including Co2, does cause a warming effect. Svante Arrhenius first calculated the extent we would warm, before the turn of the century. Hans Suess in 1955 did a analysis and discovered that the co2 levels were being effected in the air, by oil companies. In 1960, Charles David Keeling did actually prove that co2 was rising, and we were on a path to warming. Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald also, after keeling, made a calculation of HOW much the climate would change, giving the current path.

I know this is just a little semantics, and was probably cut for sake a brevity. But its important I feel that people don't get the idea all this was started in the last 50 years; we've know of this for well over 150 years. I think the author intended this to only a segway to the topic of the modern attention of the masses. But still, misinformation is misinformation. Oil companies DID NOT discover climate change, at all. They discovered certain effects, gathered from theories well established before them."

Understand that all the talk of scamming, alarmist scientists scared the scientists into being ultra-cautious about being seen as alarmists, so that is why they left out of their models all the methane that is bubbling up from where the permafrost is melting away in the Arctic Circle. Instead they only counted the methane from wetlands and farting cows. Methane is far more potent a GHG than CO2 and speeds up the melting of the ice far faster than the models indicate. This is why they keep saying how surprised they are about how fast Climate Change is progressing. Instead of the end of the century, it will only be a few years, within a decade before things are truly catastrophic. Look up what happens once we start getting Blue Ocean Events (BOEs) or go here: http://www.scientistswarning.org/wiki/blue-ocean-event/

Also Exxon's scientists didn't discover the Greenhouse Effect. That happened in 1896 when Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius found that burning fossil fuels emitted CO2 which absorbed infrared radiation (heat) which then warmed the atmosphere. The more CO2, the warmer the atmosphere and the planet. We are currently emitting over 30 billion tons of GreenHouse Gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere every year."

For the earth could never be destroyed by humans in that way. Nature has a way with dealing with environmental troubles through its natural cycle of polarity. 
And yes, that could mean rising tides, deadly heat waves, and forest fires. ALL of these deadly results are part of Earth's natural cycle of polarity and in some way or another, will lead to the planet being safe for humans again in the future.
The fact that global warming is a thing, is PROOF that Earth is actually VERY healthy. This natural law of polarity that is causing global warming, acts almost like the planets immune system. Which is why in the past, even before humans, there was an ice age; perhaps even multiple ice ages. 
And I'm sure if humanity was around during the ice age, they would somehow try to blame themselves for it. Just as we blame ourselves for global warming. 
The truth is, the Earth doesn't need our help...
The planet in more than capable of dealing with the problem naturally just as it did during the ice age. 

Just as a side note: 
I find it very ironic that ASAPScience demonized the big oil industries for purposly politicizing the issue, when in fact ASAPScience did the exact same thing in this video; showing that AOC has a ""green new deal"" in order to push their political agenda...

I think that even those who deny anthropogenic climate change can get behind this, so you can use that to convince them that it's a good idea to remove fossil fuels, because it's their combustion that generates most pollutants."

There are many other sources for co2 but carbon itself does not combine with anything in the atmosphere to create co2. Second literally nobody denies that co2 absorbs heat in the atmosphere. Also you know how plants have this thing called photosynthesis yah well that’s what takes co2 out of the atmosphere. The question was is the added amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to much for the natural processes to regulate. The conclusion (that global warming exists) is not what I have a problem with in this video but rather it’s nearly the only thing it gets right."

What they were doing was not saying they should hide the previous science for their own gain. They were saying (as are 'deniers' of today) that there isn't significant enough evidence to come to a drastic conclusion. 


To digress quickly, the use of the term 'denier' in regard to the study of climate and potential anthropogenic effects is extremely alarming. It shows that the issue has moved from being a scientific question to a political dogma nearing a point of becoming a religion in and of itself. Any scientific question should be able to be studied. Those who study them are not 'deniers' for straying from the manufactured narrative. They are scientists doing what scientists are supposed to do. 


Secondly the idea of consensus on the issue of climate change is laughable. It is a shining example of pseudo science/statistics coupled with the stupidity and danger of mass group think. The studies that show scientific consensus are a blatant distortion of the truth so great that the content can be called a lie. The Cook et Al study that is endlessly repeated by every liberal media platform is a joke that is most often used to prove consensus. 
1st. It analyzed only the abstracts of thousands of scientific papers that contained the terms ""Global Warming"" or ""Global Climate Change"". If a scientific paper was written to study a particular phenomenon, (lets say the impact of solar radiation and the stripping of 'light' atomic particles from the ionosphere and mesosphere) this study would have an impact on the concept of 'global warming', but there is no reason for the scientist to reference it in his abstract.
Furthermore, the study included papers that imply anthropogenic causes of warming but do not test that hypothesis. These studies could include potential mitigation strategies, opinions, etc. 
A scientist saying he/she implicitly agrees with a concept without testing or questioning said concept cannot be regarded as a reliable source for the validity of the original concept. 


2nd. The study lumps together people who say humans are the chief cause of warming with those who merely mention factors that are in some way responsible for warming to some extent. Effectivly, if a paper mentions anything related to climate that the editors of the study can tie back to human caused warming, it is counted as a 'yes' vote even if it did not pick one way or another. 


3rd. (this is the most damming) If the study stated that there wasn't sufficient evidence to support the catastrophic warming hypotheses, the study was thrown out and not counted as a part of the 97% in any way. 66% of the eleven thousand studies referenced specifically stated that there was not sufficient evidence one way or another and was disregarded entirely. 






Next, about Exxon building offshore oil platforms higher up to prepare for rising sea levels. If you genuinely believe this you seem to be an incompetent buffoon or too lazy to google how any oil platform works. The new oil rigs used (just like the one shown in the video) today aren't tied to the sea floor. Changes in sea level do not affect them in any way. They float.




As far as paying sceinists to promote 'fake science', they may very well have done that. The liberal billionares like Tom Steyer who have fortunes from the new green political movement have the same incentives Exxon did and are just as likely to be corrupt."

https://judithcurry.com/2016/04/17/the-paradox-of-the-climate-change-consensus/

There is genuine scientific consensus on the following points:

global temperatures have increased overall since 1880

humans are contributing to a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations

CO2 emits and absorbs infrared radiation

*For the most consequential issues, there remains considerable debate:*

*whether the warming since 1950 has been dominated by human causes*

*how much the planet will warm in the 21st century*

*whether warming is ‘dangerous’*

*whether radically reducing CO2 emissions will improve the climate and human well being*

Leveraged by the consensus on the three points above that are not disputed, the climate ‘consensus’ is being sold as applying to all of the above, even the issues for which there remains considerable debate.

For past a certain point, each increase in the level of consensus makes it more difficult for new information to surface, thereby lowering the veracity we should assign to it.

The skewed scientific  ‘consensus’ does indeed act to reinforce itself, through a range of professional incentives:  ease of publishing results, particularly in high impact journals; success in funding; recognition from peers in terms of awards, promotions, etc.; media attention and publicity for research;  appeal of the simplistic narrative that climate science can ‘save the world’; and a seat at the big policy tables.

The net result of this skewed ‘consensus’ is that inadequate attention is being paid to natural climate variability, and too many people, including scientists, assume that CO2 is a giant control knob that, if reduced, can eliminate bad weather, sea level rise, etc.

While not always clear why the K/C ratio can become highly skewed, one interpretation is that more than just the search for knowledge is at play.

Apart from the professional incentives described above, there are a range of political drivers that incentivize the consensus, including broad environmentalism, anti-fossil fuel sentiments, anti-capitalism sentiments, and a desire for world government that transcends national policies."

No one is agaisnt polluting less and keeping earth clean but the notion that we need to ban fossil fuels and spend enormous amounts of money on green energy like in AOC's green new deal are  just absurd.

Also a seminal paper from the 1970s, by a scientist not employed by Exxon, J.H.

That didn't happen. Then they said it would be gone by 2016, and that didn't happen. So why should intelligent people believe their latest predictions of doom will be any more accurate ? Antarctica... the Western tip melts a little because of submarine volcanoes, not CO2, otherwise Antarctica isn't melting at all with an average daily temperature of negative 58 degrees F. As far as sea level rise is concerned, it's about 7 inches a century and slowing. Run for your life !!!!"
"Even Andy","2019-03-17T18:08:58Z","@Rick TD Sorry Rick, but guess who is an Environmental Scientist? Me.... (Who's been to the Arctic, and studied the Antarctic for years).

I can assure you that no, nowhere is gaining massive amounts of ice, especially not in Greenland. Antarctica is complicated, but yes, still melting. 

Due to oceanic circulations, warm water penetrates the Arctic easily, which helps raise the Arctic air temperature (along with the loss of the albedo in the Arctic region). This can mean that the air temperature in winter can be upto 20C above normal. Sea ice is the most obvious thing gone in the Arctic - shipping through the Arctic ocean was not possible until recently, but tbh the loss of sea ice not something to be most concerned about anyway. Mainly its ice sheets - they will contribute to sea level rise etc.

For Antarctica, check out the work by Edwards et al (2019) who explain the complicated nature of the Antarctic really well. Basically the Antarctic has a few factors affecting change there. Firstly, the ozone layer has been stuck over Antarctica and thus insulating less heat. Secondly, it doesn't have the same oceanic circulation as the Arctic does (hence its usually colder on average than the Arctic). 

The areas that matter however, the ice sheets in Antarctica, are still melting. Particularly in the West Antarctic ice sheet."

"ivaniuk123","2019-03-15T04:56:17Z","Good video, what about the argument that the consensus of the 97 percent of climate scientists that climate change is caused by man is a lie? The evidence that I've seen to back this up is in the John Cook study (where everyone gets the 97 percent of scientific consensus on climate change). They(John Cook study) omitted the other published scientists who had no conclusion and instead just took the remainder scientists who either agreed or disagreed and that's how we got 97 percent. If you took the rest of the published climate scientists into account then the consensus is 66.4 say they don't have an opinion, 32.6 say we are the cause, and .7 say we are not. Since critical thinking is about examining all the facts no matter if they support or reject your conclusion then why believe in and spread the lie that the debate is settled because it's clearly not. There maybe lots of other factors in climate science that we are missing or maybe it's truly uncontrollable and the weather is going to do whatever it wants based on all the outside influencing factors. However cherry picking facts and reaching the conclusion first and making up evidence to get there is not the way we move forward on this issue."

You're wrong, especially when it comes to CO2.
CO2 is a denser gas than oxygen and Nitrogen meaning CO2 remains very low in the atmosphere, not high in the atmosphere which would cause a greenhouse effect and on top of that everyone throws one of the most basic bits of science out the window when it comes to CO2 and that's the simple fact that CO2 is used in photosynthesis, which means it is used by most plant life on earth, meaning the effect of more CO2 in the atmosphere has caused the world to get 20% greener than the 90's."

After a few times of this cycle happening they decided to call it climate change. They just keep moving the deadline and covering for their scam.

"Jim R","2019-03-15T02:38:16Z","From 1978 to 1998 the global avg temp of earth increased suddenly by 0.4 degrees C... and then the warming stopped.  The IPCC can't explain the 'pause', and their models do not predict the observed temperatures of the last 40 years, and their warnings are based on the models.  The IPCC is engaged in climate speculation.

""Global Warming"" was rebranded ""Climate Change""...  because the climate has been changing every moment of every day for billions of years, in extreme ways, and always will.

The correlation between CO2 and temperature seemed promising from 1978 to 1998, but historically its transient at best.  The Roman Warm Period (250BC-400AD) and Medieval Warm Period (950AD-1250AD) both occurred during periods of lower levels of CO2, and well before humans began harnessing and burning hydrocarbons to enhance their lives.

The global warming theories fell apart by 2006,  but investment in the $climate $industry that began with tax payer funding has continued to grow on a massive scale.
https://www.tesla.com/models

CO2 occurs naturally and is emitted continually by oceans (70% of the surface of the planet), volcanoes, decaying plant life, and breathing animals.  Each human adds about 800 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere each year just by breathing.

CO2 has a well known property where it's greenhouse effect rapidly diminishes as more is added to the atmosphere.  The next molecule of CO2 has less heat retention qualities than the previous.

CO2 is a minuscule part of the atmosphere.  Only 4 molecules out of every ten thousand molecules of atmosphere are CO2.  150 years ago, before human industrialization, it was 3 out of ten thousand.  In other words, after 150 years of hydrocarbon (fossil) fueled industrialization, plus all the CO2 emitted naturally, there is one extra CO2 molecule out of every ten thousand.

CO2 is essential for life, its not a pollutant.  If the level dropped below 1.5 CO2 molecules per ten thousand atmosphere, plant life would struggle to survive.  In fact more CO2 might be a blessing in the fight against world hunger... CO2 is plant food.  The planet is a little greener today than 100 years ago due to a little extra CO2.

The current level of CO2 is 400ppm (parts per million, or 4 parts per ten thousand).  NASA considers a space station safe with levels up to 3000ppm to 5000ppm.  Submarines are considered safe up to 5000ppm to 8000ppm.

Arctic ice is melting, but only represents 1% of the planet's ice.  The Antarctic and Greenland hold the other 99%  (90% and 9% respectively), and both have seen their ice increase significantly over the course of the last 100 years.  They build research centers in the Antarctic on jacks so they can raise them up each year to keep up with the ice/snow accumulation.  Here's a story about a plane (Glacier Girl) that made an emergency landing on Greenland in 1942 and was discovered under 270 feet of ice in 1992... after 50 years of post war hydrocarbon fueled industrialization.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Girl

We could go on and on, but basically the planet stopped warming,  the climate models don't predict observed climate, the climate warnings are based on the models, and there is a great deal of historical evidence of warmer periods with lower levels of CO2 well before humans began burning hydrocarbons.

It's all a bunch of speculation.  In the early seventies, scientists were speculating on the coming Ice Age.

Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas by far.

The earth's massive water system and the Sun likely play far more significant roles in the natural variability of climate.  The idea that the tiny bit of CO2 in the atmosphere as the 'primary forcing agent' driving temperature and climate is simply not supported by objective science.  Not even close.

To be sure, the $climate $industry is $massive. The banks trade $hundreds of $billions of $dollars of carbon futures every year.  Those banks donate $hundreds of $millions to the cause.  It's great for Tesla shareholders, and of course Al Gore made a fortune promoting it.  The $climate $industry is generating a great deal of wealth.

It's also uncaring. The cost of energy drives the cost of food, clothing, housing (protection from climate), healthcare, transportation, education and every other aspect of modern life.

The regressive climate policies and carbon taxes of the rich continue to keep the 2 to 3 Billion of the poorest people on the planet the poorest people on the planet.  They are poor because the most basic form of wealth is access to energy.  It is energy that has allowed humans to thrive.  

1 to 1.5 billion humans only have access to biomass energy (wood, cow dung), and another 1 to 1.5 billion have no regular access to energy... in total roughly 8 times the population of the United States.

If you don't believe any of this, that's wonderful, you're a skeptic.  Do the research, its at your fingertips.  If you haven't looked into the facts yet you believe, that's faith not science."

"Robert Murphy","2019-03-15T02:22:39Z","Maybe most people wouldn't think it hasn't been exaggerated if any of the statistics actually met up with real world effects at all.... like literally the ipcc has been caught manipulating data to make it seem worse than it is, and on top of it CO2 is a extremely weak greenhouse gas, water vapor, methane and other such greenhouse gases are thousands of times stronger, CO2 only absorbs certain wavelengths of energy so once you have so much there's no more wavelengths for the energy in that Spectrum for it to absorb and that's a literal fact that you can actually research. If that wasn't the case then when dinosaurs were on the planet and CO2 was 2000 + PPM the oceans would have boiled away. Just saying.... don't believe all the political bullshit, do some unbiased research."

"SimPit Tech","2019-03-15T01:39:52Z","Science? Where? Droughts are caused by cooling climate and not warming one. More heat equals more evaporation and rainfall.  (rainforest = hot, humid and tons of rain; antartica = freezing and the driest place on earth). Further more soil depletion is the main cause of draughts - biomass is what holds water in soil. No nutrients = no biomass = no water retention. Btw - nice conspiracy theories, shame you didn’t show some of the 90’s doomsday prophercies about the end of the world due to global warming and cities submerged under water due to rising seas (including NY) around year 2000-2010. What’s so great about freezing to death and starving on broken earth stuck back in ice age? Industrial revolution saved earth (completely by accident) from one of the worst ecological dissasters in earth history = aka. The Azola disaster - when the co2 in atmosphere plunged and earth fell into freeze cycles that last over hundred thousands years with some short (10 000 years) interglacials such as this one which just ended. Hearing people say “return co2 to pre industrial levels” is like hearing cured cancer patient saying “i want cancer back”. As for practical effects of “global warming” doomsday evangelists - it’s great way to keep the oil prices up (yay carbon tax) and make more profits while lowering the consumption of the comodity. If there was any real effort on lowering carbon emmisions biodiesels (which are carbon neutral) would get more support  (instead of fossil only petrol. Instead diesel technology is being targetted and substituted by petrol (just check japan or germany) or toxic electric cars which are charged by burning fossil fuels ... not exactly rocket science"

I am not debating the climate is changing and we are to blame to some extend for sure. I am just saying the models do not seem to be right. This year and last we had really cold months January to March and I live in the tropics. I measured the temp and it was 17. That is practically unheard of here. A month ago they said we will have one of the most severe dry seasons but for the last three weeks we had more rain than many rainy seasons. We don't do serious research here so most likely they got that prediction from a US model.

Anyway I expect this comment to be unpopular. Feel free to disagree however I am not interested in getting into any long winded debates online on this topic."
"William Knudsen","2019-03-15T00:28:48Z","Here’s an example of an effect of climate change:
The southern pine beetle is one of the most destructive insects in America. They kill millions of trees per year and cost the logging industry $43 million annually. They’re population is highest during the summer months and lowest during winter months since they’re killed off by the cold. Since the climate is warming, less and less beetles are dying in winter so they’re population is increasing at a huge rate as they’re able to move further north and therefore are causing huge amounts of destruction. The dead trees left behind significantly increase the chance of wildfires and they’re damage."

It's really fascinating how the conversation about global warming changed. Originally, it was very scientific-based and discussed the greenhouse effect. Back then, it was still politicized, but the politics mostly came down to whether developed countries should be held to the same standards as richer countries with regard to lowering their greenhouse gas output. To see speculative people about it came off as a new thing, and it's really scary how a few influential people can change the way people view a topic."

And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

Will care at last when it is done.

Would scarcely know that we were gone."

I think a question we should be asking is how do we get that CO2 out of the air. Basically how can we tilt the Carbon cycle towards pulling CO2 from the air. If we can do that, and then also find a way to turn that captured CO2 back to a fuel, we could potentially control the amount of CO2 and balance it with what we use.

Green energy is great, but it is just not cost efficient enough to be realistic. If we can't completely go green, we really do need to start looking into and building thorium reactors. From what I can find, thorium is more abundant than uranium and has a shorter half-life in general. It may not be renewable, but it will drastically slow down the CO2 output if we really ramp up plant building and usage."

Look up the Callandar effect. Also his work was expanded on by some other non-Exxon scientists in the decades following his findings, before the 70's"

I'm not sure, but I was wondering. I think you'll find that the data provided by Exxon (ExxonMobil) and BP (British Petroleum) are the only sources I need to refer to.

However, let's use Pascal's wager. 

If I am wrong what happens?
More trees and forests exist. Cleaner air and water. New technology and services industry exist...

If you are wrong what happens?
Deforestation and environmental damage continues. Dirty air and water. No new technology is developing...

I'm not even advocating for any kind of catastrophic failure or model. I'm simply arguing for a precautionary principle. Who do you think is scamming you and why?"
"Rick Voege","2021-08-26T00:27:15Z","@Rick TD Your patience and tolerance to explain to John the scam is very commendable. I like to point out that we have done the “reduce global emissions” test and it resulted in no difference in the annual CO2 gain. I suspect, during last year, we reduced the global carbon consumption by at least 20% and likely more. No change to the raising levels. 

Sounds like you have watched a lot of Tony Hiller, or the likes. Too bad too many people can only listen to the propaganda. Maybe, some will wake up. Cheers!"
"Rick Voege","2021-08-26T00:21:10Z","@John Wedderburn Interesting read between you and Rick TD. 

First question, what is the appropriate level of atmospheric CO2? Is it that the level is on an upward trajectory, that is so frightening? Is it the belief that it will never stop? Is it that earth will become like Venus or Mars? Both of those planets have CO2 levels of about 94%. 

Take a moment to evaluate what has happened in the last year. Globally, we have reduced CO2 emissions by some 20% or more. By the alarmist should be ecstatic about this level of reduction! “Look how effective this reduction has been! We need to do more!” But no, not only is there no reduction, there is no difference at all. This was well know to NOAA as the published a statement that the lockdowns will have only an 8% effect on the annual CO2 gain. And this was before the lockdowns were expected to last all year. 

I have more, but also answer why the terminology went from global warming, to AGW, to climate! Simple, the earth has always and will always be in a state of change. At least, baring the total elimination of our atmosphere. Thus, now everything can be attributed to CO2 emissions. 

You sound like an intelligent guy, take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Even at .06% of the atmosphere, CO2 isn’t close to being a threat. In fact, plants love it. More plants, more oxygen, more better?!?! Howe, at sub .02%, plants struggle to survive. Also, if you believe living in a warm environment is uncomfortable, imagine what it will be living in a perpetual cold environment. Kind of hard to glow food and live. Be careful what you ask for, you might get it."

The biggest sources of co2 emissions are natural causes like the ocean, volcanoes, and methane emissions along with animal life. The idea that before man kind the the climate was always changing and now all of a sudden it gets worse because of humans is not based on evidence. Look back for the last million years. Our highs aren’t as high or lows as low as they once were. Hell the majority of the planet used to be water now look at it. Over 10,000 years ago we had hundreds of more miles of coasts before the oceans ate it up. The notion that just because temperature has increased for the past 1500 years “more than usual” is wrong."

Lookup how climate change is supposed to affect precipitation in your area. It varies a great deal as heat leads  to desertification but also rainfall, and you can't have a desert if there's rain. How about crop yield? Increased temps increase oxygen fixation in C3 plants but increased CO2 yields greater crop yield. The only more certain negative affect is rising sea levels which can be dealt with decades at a time, excluding river flooding. Overall, we expect 2100 to be 4 degrees C warmer, so for me that's roughly -16 in the winter months and +34 in the warmer months and isn't a substantial change as everyone forecasts. Shifting the mean does make fringe events significantly more common, I'm not ignorant of this, but to think that it's going to be this devastating Armageddon seems ignorant at how good life is at surviving much much much worst than 4 degrees shift in the mean."

"Allan Richardson","2019-03-14T22:03:47Z","Academic scientists, many of them also science fiction and science essay authors, suspected this as far back as the 1940s.  Isaac Asimov mentioned it in science fact essays during the 1950s and 1960s, and used a sociopolitical analogy to the climate change problems we face as part of the plot of his novel “The Gods Themselves.”

Also, in one of his mystery stories in the Black Widowers Club series, the answer to the mystery involved a young boy from Quebec, who was a French history fanatic, describing an Exxon station as the sign of the Cross of Lorraine.  This was during the oil crisis of the 1970s, when a common nickname for Exxon was the “sign of the double cross.”

It’s pretty obvious that if we burn carbon faster than the Earth recaptures it, it will accumulate in the upper atmosphere and produce a greenhouse effect.  And we have already burned in the last three centuries an amount of carbon that accumulated over millions of years, and afterward remained sequestered in the Earth for hundreds of millions of years longer."

The world has been around for 4.6 billion years and humans have been around for tens of thousands of years. I assure you we will survive climate change, the world will be a better place once we do and we'll be stronger afterwards. There's no problem to big for humans."

Florida for example has the biggest market for beach side property, if climate change was real and the oceans are going to rise why do people with lots of money invest in properties that are going to be gone in 30-40 years? Why do big banks and large financial companies have 30-40 year  mortgages if this was the case? Why do they allow large loans to be taken out in Florida and other places that are “threatened” by rising sea levels? To me if the sea levels where rising I wouldn’t want to invest any money into property that would soon “disappear” the big banks know the sea levels aren’t rising all that significantly other wise Florida wouldn’t be the largest market for home buying.

But they can't... so by definition, until they do, the Scientific Method cannot be used here. Only Pseudoscience can be used.

Forget the fact that they only used 1 model which was mathematically wrong, and not corrected.. Let's pretend it was correct.

By only using 1 variable (C02 ""Plant Food""), and omitting factors like the giant fusion reactor in the sky! There's no way to determine if their conclusions are correct.

But by using this same methodology, I can conclude that Ice Cream Sales cause more Shark Attacks.
A completely true statement if you're only looking at those 2 factors. (Several studies have been done to prove this!) However, it omits all other factors.

Correlation does not always equal causation.

And no, this is not a straw man argument. It's simply using the same methodology Climate Change Proponents have used.

Climate is ALWAYS changing. No one denies that. We had an Ice Age, now we don't. It obviously changes. 

The question is.. do we trust these agencies that have lied to us already, about an ""imminent danger"" we cannot use any of our senses or accurate models to verify?

And if we do trust them, do we believe them capable of fixing it?

To both, my conclusion is No. Yours might be yes!

If you want to buy a solar car, or panels for your home to play it safe. That's reasonable and responsible of you to do.

But one cannot justify using the force of government and taxation for a ""theory"" that cannot be proven, given to us by agencies that have a proven record of deceiving the public.

There are 2 sides to this debate. Some people say the truth lies somewhere in the middle. I think it's more reasonable to say ""Truth cannot be created, it can only be discovered"". And I hope one day we do.

But in the meantime, ASAP Science took a 1-sided approach to this video and omitted any opposing side on a very controversial topic. Which is why I commented about his bias.

Anyways, THAT will be the last I reply. Enjoy your Ice Cream! 😉"
"DeadlyMargiKarp223","2019-03-16T19:42:25Z","@Streetter Except you are anti-science and you've done nothing show an utter hostility towards science itself. 

Yet again everything single thing you've said is factually incorrect. In addition you haven't provided any evidence to back your claims (because no such evidence exists to begin with). Worse still you're projecting since I've been the one who's been backing my claims with evidence while you've made no attempt to provide any evidence at all.

You're being willfully ignorant by refusing to even look the evidence that refutes your claims. The fact that dismissed one of my citations as ""left bias"" when it isn't proves this. You refuse to accept my evidence simply because they don't appeal to your own bias.

https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/snopes/

Calling people like you who refuse to accept evidence ""deniers"" isn't an insult it a factual observation. Opinions are worthless when it comes to proven facts especially when the evidence to support said facts are overwhelming.

Your argumentum ad nauseam that data has been manipulated has already been refuted many times not to mention people who were accused of data manipulation were cleared of any wrong doing.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climategate-scientist-cleared-in-inquiry-again/

https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/debunking-misinformation-stolen-emails-climategate.html

You accuse me of promoting pseudo-science when in reality your the one who's been promoting pseudoscience and worse science denial. You've provide no evidence to back your claim at all and your argument is basically ""its true because I said so"".

You're not pro-scientific method you're pro-science denial and pro anti-intellectualism. You refusal to look at evidence simply because it doesn't tell you what you want to hear is proof of this.

P.S AOC didn't say the sky is falling you're using strawman. Her claim is based on the IPCC report that the effects of climate change will be irreversible in 12 years."
"Streetter","2019-03-16T16:39:35Z","@DeadlyMargiKarp223 there is an actual scientific debate to be had here. 

Your ""denier"" comment with all the connotations of the holocaust is beneath you.

Snopes (not sure about factcheck)  is discredited organization with left wing biases. They omit facts or flat out lie.

So I do not accept your sources.

I actually greatly appreciate science. So much so that i feel it is always import for people to use The Scientific Method.
 Hypothesis > Test
If test fails, create a new hypothesis.

It more or less can go on forever, you may not always know whats true, but you can always eliminate hypotheses that are false. Narrowing the gap towards truth.

What you're doing, along with NASA, NOAA, Bill Nye the ""Science"" guy, etc... is Pseudoscience. Making an outlandish claim, never proving it, and insulting and criticizing people with a different opinion... ie.. calling them ""deniers""

The outlandish claim here, is that less than 0.5% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere controls the other 99.5% of the atmosphere.

There is no test that has been done that proves this. Ie. No scientific method.

Thats really a case of the tail wagging the dog. I would hope that you have some major evidence to back it up.

But there is none. Even according to their own models. Data is manipulated, and they have yet to correct the arithmetic error in their models. Those that have corrected their models see nothing alarming in their data.

So, you have an outlandish claim. No proof, unable to apply the scientific method, attack those with a differing point of view.
This is the definition of pseudoscience!

I am pro Science (scientific method)
I am anti- Pseudoscience

So. This is where I will have to leave it. You can have the last word. Doesn't matter to me.

PS. AOC did make that statement on several occasions. She really believes the sky is falling."
"DeadlyMargiKarp223","2019-03-16T03:51:25Z","@Streetter Like the anti-intellectual that you are you've made another comment that is completely devoid of facts.

Dorran & Zimmerman and didn't create the consensus study it was Cook et al and I've gave you the link to the actual study.

Due to your willful ignorance you ignored the fact that that so called ""admission"" is completely false as it was made up by a tabloid paper.

https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/02/08/noaa-scientists-climate-change-data/

https://www.insidescience.org/news/retired-noaa-scientist-doubles-down-climate-data-controversy

So your claim that NASA and NOAA fabricating data is still factually incorrect and has no evidence to support it. SO really my fact check is most certainly correct.

You're appealing to authority by citing Christopher Monckton since he has no formal scientific qualification and is in fact a politician

https://www.desmogblog.com/christopher-monckton

Your claim that green tech is a money making scheme is also completely baseless and has no evidence to support it. The reality is there are more job in green technology than fossil fuels.

There is no other side to the Exxon coverup. Exxon really did bury evidence that clearly implicated human activity as the cause of climate change and payed people to deny it.

Your quote from AOC was completely false because she never said such a thing. She was referring to the IPCC report that stated in 12 years the effects of server climate change will be irreversible.

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/world-was-just-issued-12-year-ultimatum-climate-change-180970489/

Just like every other claim you made . You have zero evidence to suggest that climate change is a scam and that NASA is lying about it.

The reality is everything you did say is BS and you have no evidence to back it up. You're clearly being willfully ignorant by refusing to look at evidence when its given to you simply because it doesn't conform to your views.

You're a science denier period."
"Streetter","2019-03-16T03:02:28Z","@DeadlyMargiKarp223 It 100% is from the 2009 Dorran & Zimmerman study.

There are 4 organizations that study this. NOAA, NASA (CDDC), National Science Foundation, IPCC. All 4 have been caught manipulating their data

NOAA was the only organization that admited it in 2017

Your fact check is not correct.

Futhermore the Climate Change Theory model was incorrect. Its called the Control Feedback Theory and it was wrong for 120 years due to a simple arithmetic error. Lord Monckton has been trying to share the corrected model for years. But despite knowing their models are wrong, NOAA NASA etc.. continue to use the incorrect model.

The point is.. there is a bias in THIS video, that overlooks people from Green Tech that have been pusing this narrative for their own personal gain, it overlooks data manipulation from these organizations.

So you have ASAP science showing 1 side, and making Exxon sound evil. When there is a legitimate other side, of people doing the exact same thing. Exxon was working with the arithmetic error to.. so anything they said is moot since their results were inaccurate.

I appreciate that you took time to try to prove your point. I would disagree with the evidence you've put forth.

But... let's pretend everything I said is BS. I am totally wrong. You are totally right.
Do you really believe the government is competent enough to fix it?

I certainly don't. To me this is clearly a tax scam.

It was one our parents didn't buy into, which is why they had to start showing us propaganda in schools at a young age to shape our minds a generation later.

Now unfortunately there are people in government like AOC that truly believe the sky is falling and ""the world will end in 12 years!"" (Thats a direct quote)

Why would NASA continue to lie knowing their model is incorrect? Who knows.. could be the $20 billion per year they dont want to lose for going along with this tax scam!

Anyways.. i appreciate the dialogue. It entertained me far more than the video! So thanks"

Green new deal will never be fiscally feasible and will lead to mass issues with food production and there's literally nothing good that will come without going above this in a systematic way. The green new deal is a political tool to misuse our hard earned money in solutions that aren't backed by facts but outrage at the problems we've caused. Critics are there for a good reason,  science has always benefited from the works of critics who go a step further than consensus mongers who push out papers of low quality just to appeal to popular opinion. I love the environment and am the director of a solar panel company, a research scholar in robotics and I love to read indepth, and being  someone who loves all that is human and also nature, I go about treating both well, but I wouldn't bend the arm of the farmers and poor people by giving unnecessary power to the government to rebuild and order innovation in the way they please. The green new deal is full of wishful thinking and fiscal irresponsibility. We must put efforts to regulate our emissions on the argument that we have the duty to protect the biosphere. But it is not because we must reduce CO2 emissions. As we will begin to enter the next inter-glacial period of the earth's life, we will have to prepare for the heating up. It's inevitable.  We must focus our resources in trying to create infrastructure that supports protecting ourselves from the effects and also our ecosystem to the best of our efforts through the process. Somewhat like what Noah had to do for the inevitable flood. Sorry for the theistic example, I know not many like such a statement. But it is what it is. The last iceage stated because of tectonic shift in the American subcontinent and the change it did to oceanic flow and we just happened to evolve into todays world as a happy coincidence. Now we must prepare for the extremes of weather. Brace yourselves, summer is coming."

As for the effects ... yeah we can already see it and we can already see warning signs that the natural buffer mechanisms can't cope with that speed (remember a century or two are nothing on a geological time scale).

There's been radical climate changes before humans and sea levels rises as well. The reality is we still don't understand climate as well as we think we do. Other than CO2, another green house gas is vaporized water and we can't even predict how clouds form, heck, we can't even predict the weather within a 10 day span. From 1800 to now, the global temperature rose 1 celcius degree and the sea levels rose at an average of 9 inches. 12,800 years ago, at the end of the Younger Dryas, average temperatures rose 10 celsius degrees in a span of 10 years, more than a 100 times faster than the one we've experienced in the last 140 years. Scientists still don't understand why this happened. Over the past 500 million years, sea levels have gone up and down dramatically (as much as 700 feet higher than today, other times 100 feet lower). My point is, the data we have shows correlation but doesn't actually suggest CO2 is what's causing the temperature to rise, it does create a lot of pollution which is killing millions of people every year though. Don't lose hope, keep fighting to reduce fossil fuel pollution, keep fighting to make a switch to renewable energy, but that might not fix the problem, only slow it down. Remember, predictions have been wrong in the past and more when it comes to climate, a subject we don't understand clearly yet."

As a 13 year old in 1972 I did a school project on global warming, so I know it wasn't discovered in the 1980's.

I first became interested in the subject as a physics major at the start of the 1970s. (And contrary to common belief, the possibility of global cooling was a short-lived minority concern among climate scientists in the 70s, not a widely accepted one.) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created during the Reagan administration. In short, Exxon scientists didn't discover climate change, they just verified what was already known. It is of course true that the company lied about it. They even hired a lot of the same people the tobacco industry had employed to spread doubt about the health consequences of smoking."

Another problem with your assertion is climate data going back a million years doesn't have the resolution to say how fast climate might have changed over a given 121 year period.

Calling people like you who deny the evidence of climate change deniers isn't an ad hominem its a factual observation.

Denialist: ""A person who refuses to admit the truth of a concept or proposition that is supported by the majority of scientific or historical evidence."" 

https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/denialist

https://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6950.full

I gave you evidence that clearly shows that people are paid to deny climate change but since you're a denier you refuse to look at the evidence.

You don't care about the foundation of the scientific process at all because you done nothing but show utter hostility towards it as restored to anti-science rhetoric."
"TAPriceCTR","2019-05-30T07:32:57Z","@DeadlyMargiKarp223 wow. You are too stupid to even argue with so i'll explain a few things to any late coming observers to help contain that stupidity to you. 

I've not even stated my position on Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Climate Change... I stated that ""denier"" is green for ""heretic"".

An ad hominem attack is where, rather than attack the arguments of one's opponent they attack the person... works in court (regretfully) but science is about logos, not ethos... so when I say i'm not going to read articles posted without valid arguments by a pokemon fanatic, I AM committing an ad hominem attack because i'm attempting to discredit my opponent by the implication that his pokemon fetish (which is an attribute evidenced by his name) discredits him making his statements invalid... when logic dictates that what he says, not who he is, is what makes his arguments invalid. Whether the attribute cited in an ad hominem attack is true is irrelevant to whether it's fallacious. As a side, the reason i'm not following his links is because unless it's attached to an argument I've not heard, odds are, reading the link he took 10 seconds to cut and paste would be 10 to 20 minutes of reading to see nothing new, because I have done research. 

In addition to not understanding jack about what the ad hominem attack, he also proves his lack of fluency in logic when he accuses me of executing the fallacy fallacy as he describes it as identifying a fallacy when there is none... the fallacy fallacy has nothing to do with being wrong... it simply states that someone using a fallacy isn't proof that their conclusion is wrong. For example, if I use a non sequitur to determine margikarp a leftist, my logic is fallacious, but my statement that he is politically left may still be true. 

This has been a lesson in logic, the foundation of the scientific process.  :)

"DeadlyMargiKarp223","2019-05-30T06:14:47Z","@TAPriceCTR Calling you a denier isn't an ad hominem its a fact as you deliberity ignore evidence when its given to you (you didn't look at my link).

"could this name be any longer?","2019-03-14T20:07:25Z","@Xhh-Shaitans well, that's the thing, the plants that exist now have adapted to the low carbon dioxide concentration, they can no longer survive the high concentration of Carbon dioxide, so it damages them"

"GhostFS","2019-03-15T17:28:03Z","That have a huge impact but is a slippery topic...

As the impact of livestock farming... is due mostly to animal being alive, eating and drinking and ""processing"" what they have eaten. So the solution to stop animal produced CO2 is not to stop heading animal... is to have less animals around.
And also human being have this problem when alive.

So... better keep the  attention concentrated on the impact of our energy waste/production and less on the fact that thing that live and breath are also a problem.

Otherwise we give more stregth to people that propose to reduce the quantity of living things as a solution."

To replace fossil fuel we need an energy-source able to deliver steady power, non stop. The only realistic solution is nuclear power. We have the technology to eliminate CO2-emissions, but yet we are afraid of using it. Nuclear waste can be buried deep beneath the earth, as Sweden and Finland are about to do. Also, safetyissues are really exaggerated. Germany recently shut down nuclear plants and had to go back to burning coal. How can any ""green""-person see that as a victory? The change away from fossil fuel has to happen asap, but renewable energy sources are not able to deliver the amount of energy we need at the steady level we need."
"John Shirley","2019-03-14T18:40:07Z","The push back is simply to make the issue less about politics and more about finances. Switching to sustainable sources for energy, food, materials can save you a lot of money in the long run (there is an initial investment don't get me wrong). Not everyone wants to save the earth, but I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like saving money. Let capitalism fix the issue capitalism created"

"TechySeven","2021-07-18T21:35:38Z","@Ian of Liverpool You should read that First Link, Ballotpedia, a bit more carefully and thoroughly.

Carbon Dioxide is ""the fourth-most abundant compound in the atmosphere"" and ""Currently at levels of Over 0.04 percent (400 PPM)."" YES... 
But guess what?!  That's ALMOST TWICE it's NATURAL MAXIMUM Prior to The Industrial Revolution in the 1800's.

The Earth goes through glacial periods of cooling, then interglacial warming periods, regularly following the natural deviations in the Earth's Tilt.  These are known as Milankovitch Cycles.  We SHOULD BE IN A COOLING PERIOD RIGHT NOW... But Guess What, We F#@%ED it UP with our Burning of Fossil-Fuels for Hundreds of Years which we've ONLY Exponentially INCREASED Our Burning Rates For.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels naturally deviated (Alongside corresponding Milankovitch Cycles) in the last Million Years from Between 0.017% (117 PPM) to about a Normal Maximum of 0.028% (228 PPM) (only reaching a Natural 0.03% (300 PPM) ONCE, Briefly, in the last MILLION YEARS), and the last time the Earth's Atmospheric C02 Levels were As HIGH As They Are Now was OVER 3 MILLION YEARS AGO, when temperature was 2°–3°C (3.6°–5.4°F) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.

It is a Scientific Observational FACT that Atmospheric C02 Level increases CORRESPOND with a Followed Atmospheric Global TEMPERATURE Increase.
And it is a Scientific Observational FACT that our Reliance On Fossil Fuels for industry, electricity, and transportation Has EXPONENTIALLY Increased Atmospheric CO2.

Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of Many Millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few Hundred years. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.

Glacial Periods of the Milankovitch Cycle Naturally last around about 90,000 years.  And a full change in the Earth's Natural Tilt takes about 40,000 years.  Guess what, The Earth already Finished Reaching it's Nearest (Warmest) Tilt about 10,000 years ago and is Now in the process of it's 40,000 year tilting Away From the Sun and COOLING. So, AGAIN, the EARTH SHOULD BE COOLING WITH DROPPING C02 LEVELS...  BUT NOOOOOOOOOO, IT'S NOT, C02 Levels are ACTUALLY STILL INCREASING AND The Earth is HEATING UP!!

A Good Analogy here... is that it's a bit like...  Putting some Ice-Cream in the Freezer...  Only to open the Freezer Later to find that the Ice-Cream Has Caught On FIRE.

I'm not sure where you pulled those numbers from, but Greater Than 0.01% (Which is Actually the Approximate Current Difference between it's Naturally-Occurring Average Maximum) IS MUCH MUCH Greater than 0.0016%.  Maybe the source you got that number from was referring ONLY to What Humans Themselves BREATHE OUT, Rather than What We BURN INTO THE AIR???"
"Ian of Liverpool","2021-05-24T21:08:10Z","Co2, which is blamed for climate warming, has only a volume share of 0.04% . And of these 0.04%  CO2, 95%  come from natural sources, such as volcanoes or decomposition processes in nature. The human  content in the air is thus only 0.0016% .

At your age I would have said the exact same thing you did (I'm 25 now). I didn't understand why anyone would ever be vegan. The great thing about your generation is that you really have the world's knowledge at your fingertips with the internet. You can do research and learn almost everything you want to know from your phone. Just the fact that you responded in this way shows you have great morals and care about the environment, and all of its inhabitants. The current state of things right now seems out of reach but every day people are working to make things better. Electric cars weren't even an option 10 years ago. Now they're expensive, but they're here. With increasing demand and technology they will eventually become the norm. Awareness for these issues has grown so much since 11 years ago when I was 14. It's hard to see it but it is getting better exponentially with the spread of knowledge through social media. Thanks for being a part of the conversation and awareness 👍"
"JaXe Astral","2019-03-15T22:07:37Z","Richard Roberts I agree. I do want to fix this however I don’t force my opinions down people’s head. Again, the new technology is expensive. A huge amount of these carbon missions come from developing nations like India and China which for the most part can not afford this new technology. Indeed, as technology develops we also follow suit. In Europe and N.A we have changed a lot of our ways. Also, a lot of these carbon emissions come from factories meaning that telling the average person to change their way will not stop/ change the way the factory operates. Currently, electrical cars are much more expensive than gas powered cars."
"Richard Roberts","2019-03-15T16:02:18Z","@JaXe Astral We should have started making major changes decades ago. Unfortunately humans have the tendancy to say ""we'll do it later"" we have now come to the point where either we do something now or suffer serious consequences. As a young person you should be shouting the loudest to make changes now. It's your future. We have been told we have 12 years to fix things, not 12 years before we must act. Some sacrifices that we need to make will negatively impact our quality of life. Unfortunately we don't have a second planet to escape to so we have to make them. Please don't be angry with the people who are trying to fix the world, whether you agree with their methods or not. Be angry with the ones who seek to have people continue consuming and polluting because it makes them money. We're on the same side.

Many people can not afford the new technology which is safer and better."

"Big G","2019-03-14T18:25:29Z","One of the problems with the folks that argue this issue is that they insert unnecessary falsehoods.  The truth is enough to freak out any thinking person!  For example: the rigs in the gulf actually float.  They are literally qualified by the Coast Guard as sea vessels.  It essentially looks like a big pontoon boat when out of the water.  Google it, there are lots of pictures.  So they are not building them taller for ""rising sea levels"".  Now this is NOT something to actually use to argue against climate change but it does give the dummies one thing to grasp upon to even make their misguided arguments. I used to work in the oil business and this is something the entire industry actively searched for in internet activity.  That are grasping at straws.  Don't give them any."

"Davidjune1970","2019-03-14T18:22:27Z","Climate change is such a complicated subject that I am not convinced anyone has actually looked at the earth as a whole to evaluate the impact of everything from the sun, to natural occurrences (volcanic activity, animal activity, people, decay of organic material, deforestation, etc.).

The current approach basically says we have to give up energy period. There is no green energy solution that won’t involve fossil fuels. So saying solar and wind are the answer is the most ridiculous agenda ever, as it completely ignores the impact of those technologies on the planet.

And while industrialization has increased around the world ... so has the population size. Everything that breaths releases CO2. 

Frankly the industries in North America have spent billions to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution, to the point where they are hitting the wall where further investment yields minimal improvement. Whereas industry in third world countries do not invest anything close to that amount. 

The world would immediately improve if the west gave those third world countries the money to improve their energy efficiency and reduce pollution. Most of those plants are making things for consumption by the west anyway."

Basically what i get from you is you're incapable of being a adult and making your own decisions and need the government to make them for you(socialism) . Whereas I believe people are able to make better decisions for themselves than the government.

Companies make decisions based on profit, as without any profit people lose their jobs. 
You say companies decide wages, I beg to differ. It is the worker's decision,  on whether they'll work for that wage. It's a negotiation between the business and the worker. The business has all the risks and overheads, so they want to pay as little as possible to keep in business. The worker wants to be paid as much as possible for as little work.  If no one can go up or down, then the worker (you) will not be employed. 

If consumers can't change businesses by voting with their wallet ie: buy renewable energy.  Then why is it Apple started producing big screen phones?.... Maybe it has to do with another company offering them and the consumers were putting their votes(money) with them. 
Apple profits go down, Apple sells big screen phones. 

Individuals have huge power to change companies, it's just a matter of them wanting to."

The reason this kind of evidence is unhelpful isn't because it doesn't support climate change, it's because it suggests that local evidence - taken over a short time period - of a global event which takes place over many years is valid evidence. Basically it means that you saying ""this year we had weird weather in this part of the world"" is just as valid as me saying ""this year we had very normal weather in this part of the world.""

"凌lzl","2021-09-18T03:26:49Z","Nuclear plants, right now, is already a better option then fossil fuels. The disaster caused in Japan is due to their archaic technology used in Second World War and they didn’t renewed it so it cannot withstand the force produced in the explosion and that’s why the nuclear plants exploded. 
The nuclear plants nowadays are really strong and tough that it can withstand the devastating impacts cause by a nuclear bomb. Actually every part of the process in nuclear fission are well guaranteed and there’s a control rod to stop the process of nuclear fission. This is also the reason why the nuclear plants in Former Soviet Union exploded because people didn’t insert the control rod completely and the process of fission didn’t stop. 
Besides, The radioactive waste are buried deep underground(according how long their half-life are) in less developed places like Africa, because more developed countries like US or China promised to give them resources and money. 
However, nuclear plants is not a renewable energy as the main resources, which is the Uranium-235, an isotope of Uranium-238, is finite and can be used up in future. Also the nuclear waste produced needs many years until they all decayed according to their half-life (eg. Iodine-131 needs 8days to decay half once and Strontium -90 needs 29 years to decay half once). 
We also need water to cool down the nuclear reactors and the resulting hot water will cause thermal pollution and damage the habitats of marine life.
Nuclear fission is much cheaper then fossil fuels for generating electricity and cause little environmental pollution while fossil fuels emit large amounts of air pollutants. Although there’s some consequences of using nuclear fission, the pollutants produced is much lowered than that produced by fossil fuels."

First there is nothing ""natural"" about making air travel obsolete when the government is pouring money into high speed rails and taking it away from air travel. It's artificial obsolescence.

"BigBadDogIV","2019-03-14T17:50:03Z","This is from a Debate I had with a Liberal about Anthropogenic Global Warming AKA Man-Made Climate Change...

""So your argument is that mankind makes up the overwhelming majority of global warming. Now there are many different fact-based counter-arguments I could use to explain why that’s wrong. I could explain how the climate has always been going through massive changes since the Earth’s very creation billions of years ago. I could further elaborate on that point by explaining how in just the past two thousand years we have seen the “Roman Warm Period” which lasted from roughly 250 BC to 400 AD, and was even hotter than it is today. Followed by the “Cooler Dark Ages” which lasted from roughly 450 – 900 AD. Which was then followed by the “Medieval Warm Period” which lasted from roughly 950 - 1250 AD and was at least as warm as today. Which was next followed by the “Little Ice Age” which lasted from roughly 1300 – 1850 AD. After that was another Warming Trend which we are currently in right now. It is generally agreed on by all scientists that before the 1960’s there is no way that CO2 emissions were sufficient enough to play a part in climate change. However, the current warming period started around the 1850’s roughly a century before humans could start playing any significant part in it. This would be an entirely fact-based argument.

Or instead of that counter-argument I could simply point out that right now Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto are also going through a warming period. Astronomers found this out by measuring the ice on those planets (Pluto isn’t technically a Planet anymore but that’s just semantics). That would also be an entirely fact-based argument.

However, the argument I would like to focus on is one that’s a little more simple yet still fairly indisputable. Your entire belief relies on mankind's CO2 emission being the primary factor in global warming. This is the entire core of your belief and if it is proven wrong then your entire beliefs about global warming are false. So let me ask you something. Do you know why climate change alarmists were so big on using the term “global warming” in the 90’s but shortly after the beginning of the 2000’s they quickly decided to switch to the term “climate change”. This was actually pretty simple. The reason why is cause global warming STOPPED. That’s right, around the beginning of the 2000’s the climate stopped warming and has remained flat since then. We are nearing two decades now with no change in the temperature of the climate. So maybe right now you're thinking “oh well, humans must have lowered their CO2 emissions”. And if that’s what you’re thinking then you are dead wrong. In fact it’s quite the opposite. Mankind is actually expending more CO2 emissions than ever before. In fact about 25% of all CO2 emissions from all of humanity have occurred during this period of no net warming.

So here’s the deal, your belief is that mankind is the primary factor that contributes to the warming of the climate and the primary way they do this is through CO2 emissions. Your belief requires that the more CO2 emissions humanity is expending, the warmer the climate gets. This is the very core of your belief and it’s critical that it be true or your beliefs are just flat-out wrong. This is not some trivial detail for your belief, this is make-or-break. Now the facts make it very clear that humanity is expending far, far more CO2 emissions than ever before and the climate is not warming. This means that your beliefs and the facts are incompatible. They cannot both be true, it is simply a logical contradiction. You have to choose what has more credibility to you. Your ideological beliefs or the facts. I choose to believe the facts over any of my ideological beliefs. If a fact proves my ideological beliefs wrong then my ideological beliefs adjust or change entirely. Now you have to choose whether or not you will ignore the facts so that your ideological beliefs do not have to adjust or change for them. To be completely honest I don’t think you will. I think you will do exactly as I have said liberals do. You will ignore the facts as soon as they become inconvenient for your ideology. Just as you ignored all the facts about Justin Cooks fraudulence earlier. Generally speaking, you guys hold such blind, irrational faith in AGW that it is comparable to a religion for you guys. For most of you, there is no amount a facts in the world that can deter you from this near-religious faith in AGW. I hope you are an exception but I sincerely doubt it...""

Methane is far worse for the atmosphere and CO2 meaning the the millions upon millions of cows that live on farms drastically help climate change happen more quickly. Agricultural greenhouse gas is also never considered to be dangerous by the thousands of companies that are trying to end climate change."

I don’t even so much disagree you but my lord why are you complaining so much about this when all they did was make a video about a particular subject and they stuck to that subject??"
"W. J. R.","2019-03-14T19:02:43Z","@Robert Sommers Point to me the timestamp where they admit the issue was know before, and by others. The framing and focus is more about one company which did play a big part, but was not the sole operator. Thus the declaration of disingenuity. Where are any other oil companies mentioned, where is OPEC mentioned? It's like talking about WWII and only mentioning the German involvement and conflicts completely omitting Japan and its involvement. I like this channel, and normally have no issue with the content. I take issue because I see something wrong and I feel this channel is better than that. I feel they are better than what seems to come off almost as propaganda because of its focus on Exxon and omission of any other parties... So, it is by every means coming across as saying Exxon knew about the issue before anyone else and then is the sole cover-up party, and I'm trying to point out that this is not the case. It should be explicitly mentioned and not left to those of us that know better to realize the sidedness of the argument and assume that those that watch this will look up more on the issue for a bigger picture. I have clarified my statements enough, my position and objections are on the record, I will no longer reply as I have more important things to do for my day. Thank you for prompting me to be as thorough as I have been to make sure I've covered every angle to my objection at the premise and presentation. In conclusion, I still like the channel, the content in other presentations are usually spot on and quite enjoyable, I think this one got it wrong through omission  and presentation not in exact content but in the large amount of relevant content omitted and the focal presentation on Exxon's involvement."
"Robert Sommers","2019-03-14T18:29:40Z","Saltlake Seattelite Tell the time stamp where they say no one else knew before Exxon.

It isn’t saying the Exxon is the sole issue by any means."
"W. J. R.","2019-03-14T18:24:54Z","@Robert Sommers in less than 30 seconds into the piece it tries to establish Exxon as the bad guy knowing about something we ALREADY KNEW almost 30 years earlier. it is disingenuous to present the information in such a way as to blame a single company with hiding information about something that was already known. The information is solid, it's the presentation and demonization of a company I have no love for. Their gas prices are higher than most other stations, and I am disgusted with their handling of the Valdeis issue so long ago as well so don't mistake my objections about this as even the slightest appreciation for such a shithole of a company as it is more a railing against demonizing and bame-games through omission. Regrettably the issue of global warming, carbon emissions and the link to fossil fuel  use has been known for much longer and has been ignored for much longer. It is fair to identify Exxon's involvement in a misinformation campaign, but isn't the rest of OPEC also a major contributor in that? Where is the coverage of OPEC, and IT's involvement in the whole thing. It was grazed upon with the FSU metal, but not even mentioned. Don't play a blame game on the hand and ignore the rest of the body including the head."

I did that debate years ago and I have been copy and pasting this exact copy and paste for years now. Both in the YouTube comments, on Facebook, as well as other places. You can see the full context if you want to verify it yourself.

If you want to make an argument countering my arguments then please feel free to do so but if you're just going to post shit links as your argument then don't bother. As a matter of policy I don't waste my time on unserious people who can't even make the argument themselves and have nothing but memes or shit articles to do their arguing for them. You want to use a meme or an article to enhance your argument, that's perfectly fine. You want to be intellectually lazy and have a meme or a link doing you're arguing for you, find somebody else to debate. My free time is too precious to waste on people that are that intellectually lazy.

Lol, that's so incredibly convenient to try to disassociate your Doomsday Prophet Al Gore's claims from him like that. The man literally made a book and even a movie that made him tens of millions of dollars off of those predictions. He literally ran for president based off those predictions and almost won. And now you guys are trying to sweep it under the rug just like that with the ridiculous excuse of ""it wasn't him really saying it"".

Let me ask you something, are you at least going to acknowledge that these so-called ""qualified scientists"" on the subject of climate change are no longer credible and no longer should be making any predictions. And if they are foolish or deceitful enough to still be making Doomsday predictions then nobody like you or anybody else should be taking them seriously anymore. Or are you just completely inconsistent across-the-board...

Yes, NASA DID say that there's more Ice Gains then there is Losses...

https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses

I listen to proven facts all the time, every single day. In fact I have given here three different entirely fact-based arguments which you by the way have utterly failed to rebut. And in fact you are going to absurd lengths to avoid addressing the arguments I have put forward. You accuse me of copy and pasting somebody else points which is not true, but even if it was, so what. That would not make them any less accurate. You yourself are the one that is refusing to acknowledge the proven facts that I have put forward. You are the one being anti-intellectual by your own standard. If you would like to finally address one of the three arguments I have presented then I would love to go back and forth with you on it. Hell, I'll even let you pick any one of the three to focus on. You may figure out which one you feel is the weakest and then we can debate on that.

Either way your avoidance of my arguments has become ridiculous and if you want to continue this then I would really like you to finally stop going to such ridiculous lengths to avoid them."
"DeadlyMargiKarp223","2019-03-15T05:14:23Z","@BigBadDogIV No they aren't fact based and you didn't write it because I've seen this copy/pasta before and as I said before they have all be debunked.

https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php

Also the predictions on climate change weren't made by Al Gore they were made by qualified scientists. And no NASA didn't say there is more Ice they say the exact opposite actually.

https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ice-sheets/

The only one who isn't fact checking are climate change deniers like you. Your claims that the evidence has been credited is completely false.

You're being anti-intellectual by refusing to listen to proven facts."

The copy and paste is of my own words from a different time so trying to point that out as a criticism is not only irrelevant but ridiculous. And no they have not been debunked. Not by anybody and most certainly not by you.

The predictions of Doomsday Climate Prophets like Al Gore and his ilk are notoriously inaccurate. Based on Al Gore's predictions neither you nor me should be alive right now. But you guys don't fact check and you don't verify so he's actually able to keep getting away with doing what he's doing even though he's been highly discredited now thanks to the inaccuracy of his predictions. For example, Al Gore predicted that by 2014 the ice caps will have completely melted but a 2015 report from NASA says that there's now more ice than ever.

And do I even need to get into how you guys and your Doomsday Climate Prophets are now essentially predicting the end of the world in 12 years or can we both agree that that's entirely insane."

Ask yourself the question why would an entomologist have a professional opinion on the cause of climate change? The answer is they wouldn't they care about bugs that is their speciality that is their field of study and even if they had an opinion of a different field it would not be a professional opinion

That percentage of the world's scientists speaks only of the world's climate scientists they don't study things like geology volcanology or solar physics and therefore the things that affect the climate from those fields of study have not been fully accounted into their climate models yet

Don't get me wrong we need to stop polluting the planet and CO2 isn't the only thing that comes out of a tailpipe but misinformation is misinformation and I'm just sick of seeing people follow pop science like it's a religion and argue against up-to-date confirmed scientific information with pop science rhetoric

The same scientist that calculated the amount of global warming due to the CO2 in the atmosphere admitted they overestimated CO2 impact by 50% but you probably didn't hear about that climate scientists discovered that even though water vapor and clouds are greenhouse gases they have a net cooling effect due to raising the Albedo of the planet and there is all kinds of new discovery coming from solar study that confirms our sun is entering a prolonged inactive phase in other words the whole of science is not settled on global warming the reason why nobody argues against the phrasing of climate change is because the climate always has been and always will change"

I know replying with a video may seem stupid but watch it answers almost everything argued in this thread."
"Ryan Vigus","2019-03-15T18:31:44Z","@steve A few problems with that:

1) We don't have enough nuclear plants to produce 60% of the energy needs and we don't have a decade to spend on their construction even if we did.  By comparison a solar farm can be built in a year (or less).  To meet 60% of world energy needs we'd need to construct another 2000 nuclear plants and the associated mines and waste storage facilities.  That's never going to happen, especially not in the decade we have to do something about this.

2)  A nuclear plant is useful for about 50 years.  After that the plant has to be decommissioned.  So what are you going to do in 50 years when, in your plan, 60% of the world's energy production disappears?  You're going to have to be continuously building new plants.

3)  Molten salt tanks can store energy for about a week at a time and require much less land area than you suggest.  Tanks that power a 100-megawatt turbine for four hours would be about 9 m (30 ft) tall and 24 m (80 ft) in diameter.  So if we're assuming we need it for say 12 hrs a day that means it would be 27 m tall and 72 m in diameter.  Quite a bit less than a coal plant requires.

If we're going to store power for 12 hours at a time and require 100,000 TWh of storage we'd need to reserve about 4500 acres for storage.  That's less than 10 square miles across the entire planet!  Add that to the 2% of the Earth's surface we'd need to cover with solar panels to produce 200,000 TWh of electricity and you still have 2% of the Earth's surface.  And that's with the comparatively low efficiency of our current solar panels.

What you all seem to be forgetting is that we all share a massive fusion reactor.  We don't need to produce more fission reactors when we can get the energy that is already being produced.  More of the sun’s energy strikes the Earth’s surface in two hours than we consume in all forms every year.  Why are we not using it?"
"Fergus","2019-03-15T06:23:18Z","@Ryan Vigus your argument still fails to address how the hell you're gonna store the energy for an entire globe for let's be conservative and say 60% of the time. Molten salt the idea you admit is the only one that scales for storage needs basically the same as a coal plant in terms of infrastructure, just instead of burning coal for the heat its using molten salt. the true solution is to use both solar, nuclear and wind together, that way the nuclear plants can take the 60% burden while the winds don't blow and the sun doesn't shine."
"Ryan Vigus","2019-03-15T00:46:54Z","""also, the pricing is completely disconnected from the reality. an energy source that doesn’t work 80% of the time might be cheap (per kwh produced), but you still have to pay (and provide) for the power when it’s not working""

Firstly, solar works more than 20% of the time.  It doesn't produce the peak supply all the time, but it still provides supply.  Secondly, of course you have to provide for power when it isn't being generated.  That's what storage is for.  

""non-chemical storage has the same problems, it doesn’t scale ""

What are you talking about?  Molten salt scales perfectly fine.  

""no, you can’t plant crops under nuclear plants (nor can you do that and than successfully harvest under solar""

Shows that you're up to date on the topic.  'A dual-use farm operated by the University of Massachusetts­–Amherst grows a variety of plants — peppers, beans, cilantro, tomatoes, swiss chard, kale — below solar panels elevated roughly 7.5 to 9 feet (3 meters) or more above ground to allow for easier harvesting mainly by hand.'

Oh and a nuclear power plant uses more land than just the plant.  You have to have mines for the fuel sources and dump sites to contain it."

"Brian C","2019-03-14T17:50:13Z","Some countries have reacted unjustifiably negative to immigration of refugees from anthropological atrocities such as warfare or authoritarian governments. The rise of right-wing nationalism and the so-called “immigration crisis” that gets peddled by conservative pundits as a fear mongering tactic in Europe and North America indicate that immigration is not embraced. If this attitude is becoming vocal, will it be that simple to accept climate refugees?

There also the matter of housing and feeding displaced populations. Climate change decreases arable and livable land, which growing populations need to maintain their numbers."

well while some of it would probably be useful, eg almost entirely switching to renewable energy as the main source for the united states, some of it seems too much like something that cant just be implemented immediately, such as making pretty much every building in the us energy efficient, and sure this could be done but it would take years of half-rebuilding the major buildings in the country, and they're approaching it as a quick and easy overhaul. it could also do without adding like a million other political ideas to it, such as higher education laws, labor laws (such as retirement and the idea everyone would be paid enough to support a family which would be an overhaul of the entire economy and take a lot of planning also). these are very important things to consider changes to, but it should be dealt with separately, so that people aren't being pushed to allow the green new deal to pass through for the climate, but also be forced to overhaul the entire way the country works with it, whether or not they agree, because it will help stop global warming.

so basically implement the climate change parts of the green new deal by themselves."

In the actual world, if you support plant agriculture, you're literally paying people to grow more and more green plants where's if you're supporting animal agriculture, you're paying people to stab sentient beings while they want to live while also contributing to 51% of all greenhouse gases. So, no, eating plants aren't harmful to the environment. Not to mention 75% of water and land are saved by eating plants.

"Maxwell Svonkin","2019-03-17T06:20:45Z","The key here is a gradual reduction in our reliance on fossil fuels. We are producing tones of carbon emissions and as we fill the atmosphere with these gases, the climate will rise. A good example is Venus, the hottest planet in the solar system. It’s not so hot just because it’s closer to the sun but also because the atmosphere is made up of mostly Sulfuric gases, which are greenhouse gases. You say it’s 1 degree per century but that doesn’t account for the rapid acceleration of the temperature. As we release more gases, our average temperatures will rise faster and faster world-wide. When the polar ice caps melt, sea levels will rise. In roughly 50 years I believe at this rate, most (if not all) of Long Island will be underwater. I live in California and back during the tsunami that caused the Fukushima disaster we saw major changes on our beaches; the shore line rose significantly. One beach I visited was completely submerged and the only thing that prevented the ocean from covering the roads was a stone wall about 2ft high. Our planet can heal itself though. Planting more trees and flowers while decreasing emissions will result in the gradual decline of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We don’t have to ban gas cars, but rather stop using gasoline and coal for electricity. We could build dams for hydroelectric power in existing rivers, we can build windmills and solar panel farms to harness more natural energy, and most of all we could build more nuclear power plants. We talk about how dangerous they are but let’s look at the two most notable nuclear disasters: Chernobyl and Fukushima. The Chernobyl meltdown was simply caused by complacency; when the reactor first showed signs of instability they didn’t shut it down. Fukushima was unavoidable due to tsunamis that hit Japan in 2015. So what we do is build power plants inland, away from areas with frequent natural disasters and have strict regulations on operations. This way, chances are slim-to-none that another disaster will occur. And if we do this gradually, we can easily transfer from a fossil fuel reliant society to a nuclear powered society with no damage to the economy ore environment."

If you don’t see how that would affect our country terribly, I can’t help you. In New York alone, not only would you have to replace all of the millions of cars and busses, but people would either lose their cars and have to buy new ones, or the United States would have to pay literal trillions, trillions, of dollars to United States citizens to buy new cars for them. It will be  billions in New York alone. You also will have to deal with the hundreds of thousands of businesses that will be absolutely destroyed because of the banning of oil and usage of gas cars. Chevron? Yea no, you can say goodbye to them. You would also have to account for how these cars are charged, it already takes hours and hours to charge electric cars fully, where to do you think this charging docs are gonna be, well the us government is gonna have to go around to each and every city, install charging docks 15 feet apart on every street of nearly every city. What does Alexandria think we are gonna do, throw a huge cord out of our window and charge our cars from our apartments. Also, as someone who doesn’t even live in a big city( my population of my city is 40000), I can tell you that in my city alone, the changes will be enough to damage thousands of people in my city. How do you think my family is gonna fare. Imagine this, my family of 6 is going to have to shift our entire lives around, but 2 new cars, change our schedules to charge our cars, make it to school, and have my parents get to work on time so we won’t starve. I’m not trying to argue about climate changes existence to you, yes, it’s very real, it exists, but it is blown way more out of proportion than it needs to be. Imagine what would happen to my family, just mine, and then add like 300 million families to that. Yea, 300 million families all having to do that within the course of 10 years( her plan is to take affect within 10 years, or at least be completed at ten year mark)"

If the percentage of change by humans is less than 5% a year then its really pointless to prevent developing economies from using more energy. In fact the more energy they use the faster they can become more dependant on clean resources. What the fight on climate change is really about is increasing taxes and sanctions worldwide so the status quo gets preserved."

We are not causing mass climate change, the climate is changing on its own. There is no impiricle evidence to say climate change is man made. Zero evidence. The government's are pushing people towards renewables because of geopolitics not to save the rain forests. My energy bill in the UK has a 25% green tax hidden within it. It's hard to get poor families to except a tax like that without telling them, if we don't move in this direction the human race will die out. Do you understand.

All I’m doing is relaying information I’ve learned about the possible terraforming of mars. I’m sorry if it upsets you but researching the matter will net you the same answers I got when I looked into it. Just to reiterate, mars is too hot during the day, too cold at night, has barren soil, an atmosphere too thin to hold water or oxygen, winds on the planet are often hundreds of miles an hour, I could seriously go on. Oh, and what were you firing back at me with? You said it’s possible with advanced enough technology. What are we going to do, create a super space drone that fires oceans of water, fires nutrients into an entire planets surface, fills a planet with oxygen, plants an entire planet worth of trees and fauna to maintain the oxygen, thicken the atmosphere so it doesn’t let all the oxygen and water it just supplied to the planet escape, AND somehow control the weather across the planet  so the highs and lows and wind pressures are conducive to human life? Oh, and how long does this super advanced scientific space drone have to get this incredible job done in your imagination? I’m sorry to be so sarcastic with you but man you really just went right for the throat over somebody who just knows a little more than you about terraforming mars"
"Tacowith Ahat","2019-03-15T15:52:31Z","Thrionic sorry but that is just not true, technology is powerful, but theres a line between “advanced” science and science fiction. Scientists are saying mars is not terraformable because of its incredibly thin atmosphere, even if we could start pumping the planet full of oxygen and water, the oxygen would just escape the atmosphere and so would the water the second it got hot enough for it to evaporate, which would be every single day.
