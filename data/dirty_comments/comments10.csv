Also, if we DON'T KNOW what will happen when the climate gets warmer...why take the chance?  Sticking you head in the sand seems like a foolish thing to do.  I think we do know though....methane is far worse than CO2 and the permafrost IS melting releasing it."

"Jonathan O'Connor","2023-02-13T18:47:23Z","16,000 years ago no residual snow during summer at Chicago. 12,000 yrs ago a 2 mile high glacier over Chicago gouging out the Great Lakes. 7,000 yrs ago it was warm enough that there was a warm inland sea in Iceland. (Happy to provide a video with an Icelandic Glaciologist saying so). From 1300 to 1890 we were in the Little Ice Age. Since humans are responsible for Climate Change, what is the Industrial Activity we humans keep turning on and off?  (What kind of technology did we have 16,000 yrs ago when it was warm? Ans: Hunter/Gatherer. No sign of even simple agriculture... pre horse drawn plows, yet warm.) 

From Ice Core Samples 500 million yrs ago CO2 conc in the atmospehere was 4,000 ppm. Today it is 400 ppm. What were we humans doing 500 million yrs ago to make the CO2 *Ten Times* today's CO2 conc."

Blaming humans for ""global warming"" frequently fails to apply well-known solar particle forcing datasets. focusing on irradiance, never regarding Earth's weakening magnetic field & new info on paleoclimate. Nature Climate Change 11, 834-839 (2021) & Geophysical Research Letters (2022)

A huge discovery almost unnoticed, conclusively proves that extra CO2 leaking into the thermosphere has no effect on temp, with 99% of the variability accounted for by solar and geomagnetic activity. Logically, if CO2 is having no effect up there, it should not have any meaningful effect down here.

"Sensei Kurt: International Body-Guard - Realtor in Sonoma County, CA","2023-02-10T18:50:45Z","Is CO2 Earth's Thermostat?¬†¬†

Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm, which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated¬†in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds, and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible!¬†
Also, bear in mind, that water vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5% of the earth's CHG. Water vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.¬† ¬†
Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El¬†Nino) and oceans degas. Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.¬†
Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat!"

Scientists have only explored about 4 dozen and determined the ones that were active and inactive.  That leaves a whole lot of potential for ocean warming that we know nothing about.  BTW, I can no longer find that Nova episode...it seems to have disappeared.  Google will soon change the estimated number of ocean volcanoes too.  I've seen them do it in other instances.  Like when I was in nursing school I looked up how many deaths by flu and the number was 80 thousand..

"robin hood","2023-01-23T19:13:50Z","@Mohawks and Tomahawks Do you have any examples of climate change propaganda?

Yes the climate has always changed as evidenced by ice core data. And this evidence shows the climate changes over the course of tens of thousands of years. What we are seeing today is that change compressed into just 200 years. 

Nobody is disputing climate changes naturally, we are saying it is changing at a breakneck pace and that complex life cannot adapt to it at such pace. 

FYI according to Milankovitch cycles we should be heading into a new glacial period, and the Earth should be cooling down now. Human activity has overridden these natural cycles and we are instead heating up. How do we know this? ICE CORE DATA!

And I really hate this nonsense about humans having no effect on this planet.... Are you actually serious with that stance? Have you not SEEN humanity? We cover literally every inch of this planet with our activity like skin on the body. There are 8 BILLION of us churning out emissions every moment of every day. Of course we influence this planet in gargantuan ways!"
"Mohawks and Tomahawks","2023-01-23T05:13:05Z","Well, the Climate Change propagandists do it too, so tit-for-tat.
Try the truth. Climate has always changed. Forever. Since BEFORE humans existed. Ice Core samples tell us that. And it will continue to change long after humans are gone. 
Space has a much larger role than humans do on climate change. Look it up."

They took away my right to use my toilet and to work on my inventions on my property. Court of Appeal Div.1 from Seattle, Commissioner Masako Kanazawa denied my requests to prevent my arrest and homelessness. In his decision he wrote ‚ÄúDavid Muresan is safer as homeless or jail than to live on his property‚Äù.

Why are the oceans warming? What is causing them to warm? Is it CO2? Is it underwater volcanoes? What effect has the increase of water vapor from these warmer oceans had on temperature? Where on the planet does this increase in water vapor had the greatest effect?"" I personally don't believe CO2 is to blame for global warming. I believe the oceans are driving our planets warming trend and that the oceans are warming for a variety of reasons, including underwater volcanoes. But not CO2."

Job 38
38 Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind:

2 ‚ÄúWho is this that questions my wisdom
    with such ignorant words?
3 Brace yourself like a man,
    because I have some questions for you,
    and you must answer them.

4 ‚ÄúWhere were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
    Tell me, if you know so much.
5 Who determined its dimensions
    and stretched out the surveying line?
6 What supports its foundations,
    and who laid its cornerstone
7 as the morning stars sang together
    and all the angels[a] shouted for joy?

8 ‚ÄúWho kept the sea inside its boundaries
    as it burst from the womb,
9 and as I clothed it with clouds
    and wrapped it in thick darkness?
10 For I locked it behind barred gates,
    limiting its shores.
11 I said, ‚ÄòThis far and no farther will you come.
    Here your proud waves must stop!‚Äô

12 ‚ÄúHave you ever commanded the morning to appear
    and caused the dawn to rise in the east?
13 Have you made daylight spread to the ends of the earth,
    to bring an end to the night‚Äôs wickedness?
14 As the light approaches,
    the earth takes shape like clay pressed beneath a seal;
    it is robed in brilliant colors.[b]
15 The light disturbs the wicked
    and stops the arm that is raised in violence.

16 ‚ÄúHave you explored the springs from which the seas come?
    Have you explored their depths?
17 Do you know where the gates of death are located?
    Have you seen the gates of utter gloom?
18 Do you realize the extent of the earth?

Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm, which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated¬†in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds, and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible!¬†
Also, bear in mind, that water vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5% of the earth's CHG. Water vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.¬† ¬†
Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El¬†Nino) and oceans degas. Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.¬†
Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat!"

The ""real fact"" is that for 4 billion years the earths climate has been changing. Humans have nothing to do with that. Space is far more influential than humans are towards climate change, look it up... but we can't tax that, so blame it on things they can tax. 
That's why this is about control. Climate change is a real thing, NO ONE denies that, what people oppose is HOW it is happening. Again, not from humans. Use your brain and wonder WHY it's been happening for 4 billion years, then ask how long it's been since the industrial revolution? In fact, since humans came along, the climate has stabilized.

What you can assert without evidence I can dismiss without evidence. 
Let me know when you have this tons of evidence against global warming. You've not once presented or cited anything for it.

Edit: Isn't a little redundant to add Global Warming after Greenhouse Gas since the greenhouse gas effect is what helps keep our planet warm?"
"Glenn Davis","2023-01-17T16:23:27Z","@Taylor The Tuna Fish 
Gee. The moon drops 250 degrees C on the night side. With near zero atmosphere. 

The unquestionable science is that, yes, beyond a doubt our atmosphere and the atmosphere of every solar body with an atmosphere, absorbs and retains to some extent the molecular heat transfer of surface molecules contact. 
That‚Äôs Physics 101, the science that has existed since science was introduced to society. The transfer of energy between molecules. 
Lately there is now Physics 201, the reality of particle energy. Which has obviously taken a great deal of interest and study, and produced relatively amazing results. 
But the fact is, you need a HUGE amount of particle energy to overcome mass inertia in any real world application. It doesn‚Äôt move mountains, but can subtly affect reality in many ways. 
So, GGGW( which means Greenhouse Gas Global Warming, I thought you knew that) is factual science up to the point where it claims particle energy leads to large amounts of molecule energy without a source of energy far above normal. 
The climate science of thunderstorms led real scientists to create fusion cells. Decades ago. They were the original green energy solution. 
The climate science of greenhouse gases has led to no useful application over the same decades. 
Personally, and I admit I‚Äôm not personally a high level genius but I still have to wonder how people who supposedly are, can‚Äôt manipulate their claimed planet changing molecules. 
Personally, in my stupid understanding, that‚Äôs probably because the particle energy required to overcome inertia is far greater than the theory assumes. 
Just saying. You really don‚Äôt explain who you are, or your credentials, so I do get irritated by the fact you don‚Äôt correct my science assertions and just refer to the mantra of climate doom. 
It is a trait of people to lock in a belief and completely ignore anything that argues with it. 
I‚Äôm not trying to do that anymore. 
It runs into real life problems."

Do you understand that without the greenhouse gas effect the planet would be much cooler? A whole lot cooler, in fact. Below freezing. Because without the greenhouse gas effect heat emitted by the earth would head right on out into space.

"Steve Wilson","2022-12-30T18:41:56Z","@Malcolm Stead I just did. Here in simple terms oil is deep underground... Deep underground there is NO ATMOSPHERE....

"Steve Wilson","2022-12-29T23:44:20Z","@Malcolm Stead Ok I see whats wrong here lets look at how it works today and then I'll take it back to how it started... CO2 is in a constant circular pattern of exchange between earth air water plants and living things.... Was the earth always like this NO ! Earth started with an atmosphere of little or no oxygen. O2 started to be released as a waste product of life's 1st bacteria. The atmosphere slowly changed from a little O2 to 20% O2 because of life. 
   As carbon reacted with O2 from plants and the sea it started the Carbon recycle ring we live with now... CO2 doesnt just come from atmosphere because its all over as we and almost all life forms (except those at the bottom of the sea which are on a sulfur cycle) use it as a living fuel. If things didnt decompose then there wouldnt be nearly as much CO2 as there is today. Decomposition of anything alive releases CO2... 
     If all the CO2 just came from the air then we wouldnt be able to change the amount of it.... but we KNOW that the more life that exist on earth the more CO2 we get, unless it either it gets buried deep underground or deep on the ocean floor it stays in the carbon cycle ring that we can over burden and drive earth's temps to unlivable temps and unlivable humidity if we dont work to keep it in check. There is no magic clean up here. We either examine and accept how the cycle works or we suffer even to the point of our own mass near extinction events. Temps above a wet bulb of 40C are unlivable, regardless of your physical condition. A/C can only save us temporarily... This is just straight up FACT. If you have proof that we can live long term past a 40C wet bulb temp I'd look at it, but do you really want to live on an earth thats like Mars ?

PS Fossil Fuels are literally fuels formed by decomposition of living organisms compressed and formed by tremendous pressure buried deep in the ground where there is a constant source of heat. So dead organism + heat + pressure = coal or oil which are hydrocarbons not CO2...."

"Controversially Greg","2022-11-28T20:09:47Z","Please note the following caveat placed on many websites, Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube etc:
Climate change United Nations:
‚ÄúClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.‚Äù

This is at best bias, propaganda, exaggeration or based on deliberate social engineering.
Sadly it is based on computer models designed to produce the desired result for those commissioning the prediction.
In reality the statement would seem to be a lie.
May I suggest YOU read the full IPCC Report, which fails to support the claim!

May I remind you that for centuries the consensus of scientists were claimed to believe the Earth was flat
& the consensus of scientists & the whole of the Catholic Church agreed the Sun, planets & stars all revolved around our planet!

Real science has never been reliable and has always depended on debate, new information & proof!
Remember around 80% of electricity we use is generated by Oil, Gas & other, so called Fossil Fuels & there is no scientific proof that CO2 causes Climate Change OR Global Warming!

Our planet has had a changing climate, with periods of warming, cooling & ice ages for 4.6BILLION years.
Very late in the day:

Primates emerged around 165,000,000 years ago, then

Mankind started to emerge about 150,000 years ago, Denisovans & Neandertals about 80,000 years ago and then Homosapiens.

We survived the last ice age and started farming around 20,000 years ago and the end of the ice age around 13,000 brought about extensive settled farming and towns and cities burgeoned.

In around 1810 mankind numbered 1Billion, now we have reached 8Billion.

Never have we been so healthy, well fed, well housed and had so much choice. Our life expectancy in 1909 was around 42 it is now over 80 as a result of development, initiative, invention and medicine all of which was gifted to the world having been, in the main created by the Western Civilisations."

Before politics got involved Webster referred to climate change as ‚Äúsignificant and long-lasting change in the Earth's climate and weather patterns‚Äù.

At the same time, he will preserve alive all who lead morally upright lives and sincerely want to please him. Says Proverbs 2:21, 22: ""The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it.

But there is still no proof that human-generated greenhouse gases are the significant cause of the small warming we now see - given that natural causes also exist - natural greenhouse gases as well as solar fluctuations.

"terry lazurko","2022-11-09T19:25:20Z","97% of the bought and paid for scientist agree.
I don't
The only thing that these Green climate people are doing is making green for themselves. The green is MONEY. The Koch brothers, Al Gore, and all these other wealthy people who are saying stop putting CO2 and methane into the air. Check out how often they are on their private jets, jet setting around the globe. They don't run on unicorn farts. These people and I use the term mildly don't care how much green house gasses they put in the atmosphere. don't care about cutting forests down for biomass plants. They only care about making money. There is never enough of that for them.

Earths atmosphere is composed of the following

78.084 % Nitrogen
20.946 % Oxygen
0.9340 % Argon

0.0417 % Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
    3% of 0.0417% created by Humans (3% =.001251%)
    of 0.0417% Nature produces 97% CO2 (97% = 0.40449%)

0.001818 % Neon
0.000524 % Helium
0.000187 % Methane
0.000114 % Krypton
0.00005 % Hydrogen
0.0000087 % xenon
0.000002 % Nitrogen Dioxide
0.000001 % Iodine 
Carbon Monoxide (CO) trace amounts
Ammonia (NH3) trace amounts
Water vapor (H2O), air can contain as much as 5% water vapor, more commonly ranging from 1 - 3 %.  The 1 - 5 % range places water vapor as the third most common gas (which alters the other percentages accordingly). 

So if we increase the CO2 by even 10 % it is nothing. No oceans rising. Plants will grow better.
And now they are adding Methane to the mix of what is going to kill Humans

So, in conclusion we are in trouble from the climate crazies and governments."

If it gets too hot, we create environments where we can exist comfortably. If it gets too wet, we move to higher ground. However, if our food supply is threatened, we can be in really big trouble. Our food supply is entirely dependent on small creatures known as pollinators (bees and such). If they cannot do their job, we all die. They cannot adapt the way we do. They only adapt through evolution, which is a much slower process. Small changes in temperature can greatly impact their health and the ecosystems they depend on. A few degrees change too quickly can be catastrophic.
It's OK, though, they will probably survive in small numbers and eventually restart the cycle... and maybe those pesky people will have gone the way of the dodo... done in by their own arrogance and inability to perceive the big picture."

Antarctic ice mass is being lost due to glacial calving in the main, and that trend is accelerating.

And NO, plants do not start die at 280ppm CO2 you imbecile.  FYI  over the past several hundred THOUSAND years atmospheric CO2 cycled between about 200 and 300 ppm and vegetation flourished. Furthermore, preindustrial CO2 was about 280 ppm, and agriculture was the main industry around the globe.

How is it possible, not considering just bribes and Government's hand outs, that so many follow the toxicity of the demoNcrats? Without going into details the adoption of woke by Universities is a clear indication that the manipulation of History and Philosophy has taken place within Tertiary education. It is not the first time that theories get associated with aggressivity and even violence, but to have them openly embraced by school boards and Intelligence, just to name those, is beyond belief. To introduce controversial pseudo philosophy aiming at both the Legislative and the Executive should only be considered as a good science fiction novel: to have contaminated so many is a huge toxic achievement that has global dramatic effects still very present.

All they would do is ask for more power and higher taxes because we didn‚Äôt give them enough to fix the problem in the first place. 
 Where is the yardstick by which we would measure their success or (inevitable) failure to affect the climate? What in their track record should make us believe the feds could or even would affect the climate one iota? How about a small demonstration? How about make it rain? How about stop one cloud from forming? How about you succeed at fixing the potholes and roads and bridges and schools first. Then we can talk. How about you tell us your plans (other than ‚Äúget the money‚Äù). I'll tell you why: because they don't HAVE ANY PLANS other than ""get the money""."
"John Connor","2022-10-23T14:55:38Z","So where did that famous ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù claim that ‚Äú97% of all scientists believe in global warming‚Äù come from? It originated from an endlessly reported 2009 American Geophysical Union (AGU) survey consisting of an intentionally brief two-minute, two question online survey sent to 10,257 earth scientists by two researchers at the University of Illinois. Of the about 3.000 who responded, 82% answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the second question, which like the first, most people I know would also have agreed with.
 Then of those, only a small subset, just 77 who had been successful in getting more than half of their papers recently accepted by peer-reviewed climate science journals, were considered in their survey statistic. That ‚Äú98% all scientists‚Äù referred to a laughably puny number of 75 of those 77 who answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù.
 That anything-but-scientific survey asked two questions. The first: ‚ÄúWhen compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?‚Äù Few would be expected to dispute this‚Ä¶the planet began thawing out of the ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù in the middle 19th century, predating the Industrial Revolution.

CAN'T 
Affect the Climate of the Whole World, They Claim.
2.

""...Acid rain is a  form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, 
meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). 
.
It has harmful effects on plants, aquatic creatures, eyes, & infrastructure. 
.
Mainstream Science is determined through Examination, Laboratory Experiments, Satellite Observations/Measurements Scientific Technology, Peer Review/Publication/Replication.

Acid rain is uncontestably caused by MAN:
Emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, etc.
which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.""
.
Centuries of Humans Pumping TOXIC Gasses & Chemicals into our atmosphere, 
the Vast Majority are sourced to Human Heavy Industry & COAL Electric Power Generation.

A very Conservative President with allied world leaders took concerted action 
and mostly ended this assault on our planet. 
Other Chemicals 
were later banned as additional contributors to the damage done to Earth's Climate.
1.
HUMANS Cause damage to EARTH's Climate.
2.
HUMANS Can CORRECT those damages to EARTH's Climate.

""In 1979 the Geneva Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution

"john Blaszynski","2022-10-01T19:42:14Z","As a systems engineer and former systems engineering math professor, Global warming is not a good thing for the world.  It will increase energy gradients and cause larger storms. It will be good for Canada and Russia as it increases arable land yields in these countries but the increased temperature gradient will provide more energy for weather events as we approach the next ice age, which is predicted to start in about 1500 years.  The human effect is measurable, however temperature rise impact, is multivariate and we do not have the understanding yet to scientifically predict the affect.  One thing however is that global warming due to green house gases is a positive feedback system but the next scheduled ice age will have many more poles than the poles of global warming. The positive feedback of green house gases now trapped in the tundra is difficult to quantify at this point but any positive feedback contributes to system volatility.  Not withstanding the effect on the planet, if CO2 levels rise to the point that dinosaurs could survive in Alaska and Alberta, the atmosphere would not support human life.
But nuclear war would likely be much more devastating than global warming, so attempts to control global warming must not jeopardise global political stability."

"Rick Kooi","2022-10-15T23:23:43Z","@Philip Watts   The one thing that won‚Äôt work is to keep the tax-and-spend schemes that the Fossil Fuel Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! 
.
Yes, that‚Äôs right, the top two causes of global warming (fossil fuel usage) are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity.
...
Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist

What‚Äôs emerging is the following:

    Electrify everything. 
Convert all energy services to work directly from electricity instead of fossil fuels. 
Transportation, industry, and agriculture. 
All of it. 
All gas appliances must go. 
All road transport must be electric. 
Most trains and a lot of planes must shift to electricity. 
All heat from electricity. The USA throws away two-thirds of all primary energy, mostly in the form of waste heat from fossil fuels used in inherently inefficient combustion processes. 
.
We only have to replace a third of the actual primary energy we use today to maintain our lifestyle and economy.
    Overbuild renewable generation. 
All other forms of generation with the exception of nuclear were overbuilt, 
so we‚Äôll do the same with wind and solar, and they are really cheap, 
so that‚Äôs not that expensive. 
.
After all, $3 trillion USD would provide all primary energy for everything the US does.
    Build continent-scale electrical grids and markets, and improve existing ones. HVDC became much more viable with high-speed hybrid circuit breakers in 2011, 
and 
is an essential technology for long-distance, low-loss electrical transmission.
.
    Build a fair amount of hydro storage and some other storage. 
While the storage of electricity is an overstated concern given overbuilt renewables and continent-scale grids, some are still required. Pumped hydro resource potential is far greater than the need, is efficient and uses very stable, known technologies. 
Shifting existing hydro-electric dams to be passive, on-demand storage, as opposed to baseload, is also key. Fast response grid storage can be provided by existing lithium-ion technologies, as Tesla has proven in California and Australia. By 2050, we‚Äôll have roughly 20 TWh of batteries on wheels in US cars alone, available both for demand management to reduce peak demand, soak up excess generation and to provide vehicle-to-grid electricity as needed.
.
    Plant a lot of trees. 
.
We have cut down about 50% of the six trillion trees that used to grow on earth. 
Planting a trillion trees would buy us a lot of time as they sucked about a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere per tree ... over 40-200 years.
.
    Change agricultural practices. High-tillage agriculture is a process that keeps releasing carbon captured by the soil back into the atmosphere. Switching to low-tillage would buy us a lot of time as the CO2 captured by farmland would stay in the soil a lot longer, and some of it would be permanently sequestered.
.
Fix concrete. 8% of global CO2 emissions come from making Portland cement. 
It‚Äôs absolutely critical to urban densification and industry, 
so we won‚Äôt stop making it. 
.
But it‚Äôs a huge source of CO2, about half from the energy and half from CO2 that bakes off limestone as it‚Äôs turned into quicklime. 
.
Electrifying that energy flow helps a lot, but capturing that CO2 is one of the few places where mechanical carbon capture makes sense.
.
    Price carbon aggressively. The simplest way to get a lot of people and industries to shift away from emitting lots of CO2 is to make it expensive. That‚Äôs what carbon taxes do.
.
    Shut down coal and gas generation aggressively. 
Getting rid of coal is already happening, but it‚Äôs by far the biggest single source of CO2 emissions. 
.
Aggressive actions to eliminate burning coal are needed. For gas, the question is how few gas plants can we build, how many of them can we run on biologically sourced methane and how fast can we shut them down.
.
    --------> Stop financing and subsidies for fossil fuel exploration, extraction, and use. The USA alone spends tens of billions annually on subsidies of various kinds for the fossil fuel industry and hasn‚Äôt done a thing about it since committing to eliminating them in 2009. 
.
The G7 and G20 have committed to eliminating subsidies, but progress has been very slow. The World Bank continues to finance coal, oil and gas projects, despite commitments to end them.
.
    Eliminate HFCs in refrigeration. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer targets the unforeseen side effects of displacing ozone-depleting CFCs with high-greenhouse gas HFCs. Project Drawdown puts this at #1 on its ranked list of solutions by cost vs benefit. The USA has not ratified this Amendment, although 65 other countries have."

1. 
The massive redistribution of wealth  and PURE POLITICAL POWER
(( you are blaming on the SCIENTISTS, Renewable Industries and ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT MARXISTS )) 
has been ongoing by the GLOBALIST Fossil Fuel Deep-State Energy monopoly AND their GLOBALIST BANKERS!!.  
Despite their enviable profitability
...they started getting Subsidies & Supports After several years of OVERLY generous political donations in 1918!
.
Those Supports/Subsidies have done nothing BUT grow!
2.
BOUGHT MORE POWER. 
3.
BOUGHT MORE POLITICIANS!
3.
19 years ago, worldwide subsidies & supports to the fossil-coal Fuel Billionaire Industrialists & dependent industries. (( and their globalist bankers )) 
had grown to 1% of the entire world's GDP...trillions of dollars.
4.
In 2016,
Paul Ryan gave a Lengthy Lamentation about the fact, that by that year's end, 
""Supports/Subsidies/Free Infra Structure Construction and Maintenance/wage supports/ Foreign Aid 
to reimburse nations for the Subsidies they are required to give OUR fossil Fuel Industries, etc. 
would REACH A MAMOUTH  ONE  (1) TRILLION DOLLARS...just in the US.
.
That same year,
5.
2016, worldwide the Globalist Fossil Fuel Deep-State and its ultra-nationalist bankers were SUCKING ABOUT 6 to 6.5% of the world GDP
.........many trillions of dollars!! 
. 
IT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST to keep you pointing in other directions!
... at welfare, at Green Energy programs, at Illegal Immigration, 
at other people's claim of Redistribution of wealth, etc. 
They point at anything but their nefarious INTENT!
WEALTH, POWER

But if you follow the money...and all the tax breaks, Deferred Taxes

    harm, let alone 'destroy' the planet.  The Earth will be just fine with or
    without life of whatever flavor...until, of course, the sun expands and 
    vaporizes it which will definitely occur in a few billion years.

    The planet's environment is what it is...certainly no more predictable or
    controllable than the weather.  If it (including climatic factors) varies
    beyond a species' ability to adapt, they go extinct.  The planet does not
    'care' either way.  

    It's scientifically (and intuitively as well) obvious that reserves of fossil
    fuels are NOT infinite.  As they are depleted, the laws of supply and demand
    will determine the cost/benefit of using them.  At some point the cost will exceed
    what users are willing (or, obviously, able) to pay...thereby creating a self-limiting 
    consumption paradigm. 

    Current technology neither has, nor can now imagine, a viable energy source
    to hydrocarbons.  At present, the possibility of making an airplane capable of
    carrying paying passengers or cargo of any useful quantity and propelled by 
    (by example) battery power is vanishingly close to zero.  We can be certain 
    that many clever people are earnestly searching for some kind of affordable 'fuel' 
    with the energy-to-weight ratio of hydrocarbons, and that could be discovered or
    manufactured with some degree of success.  It will certainly be a very
    long time until this might be accomplished or even theorized...perhaps
    even never, but almost certainly long after fossil fuels are 'extinct' as a
    practical affordable solution to energy demands. Neither educated scientists nor
    woke 'experts' can produce any scenario by which our current energy demands could
    rapidly be adapted to so-called ""green"" or ""clean"" sources."

"Sonny Harrelson","2022-09-24T07:49:15Z","There is a truth to global warming, No it's not fossil fuels. There are no more than two different reasons for the Earth's warming. The Earth turns on it's axis this is a fact not one scientist will argue,, OK there might be one but that one needs mental help. Anyway the Earth over the centuries has changed it's tilt on the axis as it has from the beginning of time. If there had been weather people back over 300 years ago who wrote down the temperature we would find out that Earth beats up and cools down every few hundred years or so,, It's a natural thing. That's the first reason for some of the warming but there is one other and before I explain it let me say this. I'm not a tree hugger but eat I am is a realist that uses Common Sense. Here is the main reason for the Carbon gases being so high,. Over the last few hundred years we have killed off about half of the tree population on Earth, Not only trees but Bushes also. Now any Botanist who are scientists will tell you that bushes and trees eat Carbon gases and release oxygen back into the air and oxygen is a natural coolant. But let go deeper into the tree and bushes thing. Let me give you just one experiment to do that will show beyond any doubt that trees and bushes help keep the Earth cooler,,, Walk out in the middle of July on a cloudless day at lets say 3 pm and just stand in and open field for only 20 minutes and feel the heat build in you, Then reach down and grab a hand full of dirt and feel just how hot that dirt is, Then walk under a patch of trees and stand for 30 minutes and I am willing to bet a dime to a dollar you will feel 20 degrees cooler then reach down and feel the dirt under those trees and the temperature will be 30 degrees cooler. Now that same day or would I say night lets say at 11 pm walk back out to the same open field and feel that dirt and it will still be warm but under those trees the dirt will be even cooler than the 30 degrees. Now remember cement\ concrete builds the Suns heat faster and even can cook an egg on a hot day. The Earth is going into what some scientists call the Desert Effect, just like a desert with no trees or bushes it becomes a waste land where very little rows or lives. Don't take my word for this do the research just like I did. If we replace just half of the trees and bushes we have cut the Earth in just 10 years will cool by as much as 3 to for degrees! These are real facts. Trees eat the carbon gases everyone talks about and replaces it with cooling pure oxygen. Put these facts in your scientific pipe and smoke it!"

Operating a house off grid is extremely expensive.  If all you want is a small TV, a little fan and a few lights, fine.  But if you want a refrigerator and air conditioning that takes compressors and they use a tremendous amount of electricity.  On very cloudy days and every single night you get zero from solar panels so now you have to buy very large expensive batteries that don't have much of a life span.
It's past time we called Fossil Fuels ""natural energy"" because it comes from the ground and when it's burned plants thrive on the carbon dioxide.  
Electric cars are charged by burning coal and the exhaust coming from a modern combustion car engine is cleaner than the air it takes in.

When water freezes it expands, but the smart people tell us that doesn't apply, because they want us to fear.

Why don't you read the views of real scientists who are experts in the field like those in the Journals Science and Scientific American? Why don't you watch the meteorologists on the Weather Channel? Science gave us automobiles, airplanes, rockets that take humans to the moon, vaccines that prevent polio and smallpox, the atomic bomb without ever seeing an atom, etc. People don't seek out expert opinions, they look for a celebrity who supports their unscientific bias against an unpopular scientific truth. It reminds me of all the naysayers, purported scientific experts paid by tobacco companies and politicians who, for years and years, in the 1950's and 1960's, claimed there was no connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Now it is disputed by almost no one that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer for the smoker and for those who inhale second-hand smoke. I lost an aunt, best friend and wife to the disease, all of whom were smokers. There are still a few scientists out there (maybe 3%, mostly that work for tobacco companies) that still claim smoking doesn't cause lung cancer but the evidence is overwhelming that it does. 97% of the experts have proven that it does. 97% of doctors and medical researchers say AIDS is caused by HIV, but a small minority of doctors, about 3%, disagree. Anytime a scientific or medical explanation of a phenomenon cannot be proven with 100% certainty, there are always those who are inconvenienced by it who disagree.

In recent times human population has increased and sprawling neighborhoods where farms and forests used to be has contributed to global warming. Lower water tables in lakes and streams can also be the result of corporations now taking that water and pouring it into billions of bottles to sell for a profit. Digging mines to get the minerals to make the solar panels and car batteries is far worse than pumping oil. The heat reflected from solar panels helps with the warming...not the electric energy stored but the sun's rays beating down on the dark panels reflects heat. Out of control forest fires from poor forestry management as well as multiple volcanic eruptions changing the atmosphere; check the Volcanic Winter of 536 AD.

As far as greenhouse gases go, carbon dioxide, from whatever source, could never be a problem in the atmosphere because there is always LESS than 10% of it there. If global warming were a real thing, water vapor would be the culprit, as the atmosphere is ALWAYS greater than 50%. So for so-called global warming forget about blaming mankind and start pumping all the water off of Earth."

What melted the last ice age?
What froze the last ice age?
Was not CO2,  it was the sun, orbit, volcanism, or comet or asteroid.
92% of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is simple water vapor.
Chemical energy got man into the Industrial Age.  Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..  
The Sun is the number one Threat to our way of life, a CME like the Carrington Event will hit the Earth 2-10 years it will set us back to the 18th century.  Not Climate charge‚Ä¶"

How long does it take for a wind turbine to pay for itself?

They conclude that in terms of cumulative energy payback, or the time to produce the amount of energy required of production and installation, a wind turbine with a working life of 20-40 years will offer a net benefit within five (5) to eight (8)  months of being brought online.  (Paid for themselves in 5 to 8 months)

Wind turbine payback: Environmental lifecycle assessment of 2-megawatt wind turbines

A 2014 study which looked at the same issue found that 2-megawatt wind turbines installed in Northwest USA paid for themselves in 5-6 months.

A 2010 analysis of fifty separate studies found that the average wind turbine, over the course of its operational life, 
generated 20 times more energy than it took to produce. This level was ‚Äúfavourable‚Äù in comparison to fossil fuels, nuclear and solar power.

Many wind turbines have a designed service life of 30-40 years, although the actual operating lifespan of a turbine can vary depending on the environment they are in, and the maintenance strategy applied to them."

Alexander von Humboldt published his research into rapidly changing weather patterns and coined the term CLIMATE CHANGE!   He defined it precisely as it is used today.

Describing Earth's Atmosphere as a Greenhouse
Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier, a mathematician working for Napoleon, was the first to describe how Earth's atmosphere retains warmth on what would otherwise be a very cold planet.. To help explain the concept, he compared the atmosphere to the glass walls of a greenhouse.

Discovering Gases That Trap Heat
Eunice Foote, an American scientist, discovered that carbon dioxide and water vapor cause air to warm in the sunlight. In 1856, she presented her findings at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

‚ÄúA paper was read before the late meeting of the Scientific Association, by Prof. Henry for Mrs. Eunice Foot, detailing her experiments to determine the effects of the sun‚Äôs rays on different gases,‚Äù noted an 1856 article in Scientific American.

1859	
Testing the Heat-Trapping Ability of Gases
John Tyndall, a British physicist, tested the gases in the atmosphere to find out which are responsible for the greenhouse effect. He found that nitrogen and oxygen, which make up almost all of the atmosphere, have no ability to trap heat, but that three gases present in smaller quantities do: carbon dioxide, ozone, and water vapor. Tyndall speculated that if the amounts of these gases dropped, it would chill the Earth.

1896	
Connecting Coal, Carbon Dioxide, and Climate
Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius recognized that burning coal could increase carbon dioxide and warm the climate. He estimated how much carbon dioxide the ocean could absorb. In an 1896 lecture, Arrhenius noted that it was not yet possible to calculate how fast temperature was rising. He also speculated that warming would be beneficial as people in the future ""might live under a milder sky and in less barren surroundings.""

Increasing Carbon Dioxide and Increasing Temperatures
British coal engineer George Callendar compiled all carbon dioxide measurements made over the previous 100 years and found that the amount of CO2 was increasing. He also found that temperatures were rising. His conclusion was that this was a good thing, that ""the return of the deadly glaciers should be delayed indefinitely.""

1957	
Our Unintended Experiment
Roger Revelle, a U.S. oceanographer, and Hans Suess, an Austrian-born U.S. chemist, realizing that carbon dioxide from industrial sources must be building up in the atmosphere, wrote in 1957: ""Thus human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.""

1958	
Climate Science on Television
The Bell Telephone Science Hour addressed how our actions could be changing Earth's climate. ""Even now, [we] may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of [our] civilization,"" said the narrator. ""Due to our release from factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide, which helps the air absorb heat from the Sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.""

1958/1965 
The American Association for the Advancement of Science published, along with the President's Science staff a stern WARNING RESEARCH REPORT on Industry/agriculture pumping huge quantities of waste gases...which act as greenhouse gases in our upper atmosphere...and the threat of Climate Change Tumultuous weather events...along with dozens of spot-on accurate Predictions/Projections.

Daily Measurements of Carbon Dioxide
Charles Keeling started making daily measurements of the amount of carbon dioxide in the air atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii. That first March day, he found 313 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the air. The measurements, which are still make each day, reached 400 ppm on May 9, 2013, and continue to climb."

Industrial Revolution Begins
Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the way people live and work has changed dramatically as manufacturing expanded. Over time, the number of fossil fuels burned increased, which has increased the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in the atmosphere. Before the Industrial Revolution, there were approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) of CO in the air. Today, that amount is over 400 ppm.

Alexander von Humboldt published his research and he Coined the term ""CLIMATE CHANGE""

1811
European scientists concurred that CLIMATE CHANGE was occurring and caused by human activities.

"Rick Kooi","2023-02-02T23:52:57Z","@Keith Davis   AuH2O forever...never Trump or Trumpanzees.
--------------------
The Goldilocks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180 ppm & under 300 ppm!
-------------------
OUR ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY IS BASED ON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm and under  300ppm.

We have no idea what increasing those gasses in our atmosphere will do to our grand Children's DNA.  We have NEVER existed outside of these levels of atmospheric gases.
.
Every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of years) 
CO2 & other Gases have ALWAYS been between 180 ppm and under 300 ppm.
2.
CO2 has boosted plant life (in controlled greenhouse operations) provided the required Nutrients, Minerals & H2O increase in the exact proportion. 
--------------------
Pernicious Invasive Species of weeds thrive with increased CO2, seemingly with any mix of nutrients, minerals & H2O.
BUT
Coincidentally, as CO2 levels have increased, Nutrient values of Grains/Crops the world has grown dependent upon, have FALLEN at a Faster Rate!
1.----LESS Iron
2.----LESS Protein
3.----LESS Zinc
4.----LESS Copper 
5.----LESS Magnesium
6.----LESS Calcium

.......In all of the Staple Grains that the world's population has become dependent upon!
.
7.---- But pernicious weeds THRIVE on RISING TOXIC  CO2 Gas Levels.
.
""... In 2004, a landmark study of fruits and vegetables found that everything from protein to calcium, iron and vitamin C had declined significantly across most garden crops since 1950....""
So you see,  
CO2 has some current benefits & MANY Immediate Challenges to human Life & well-being!

Climate Change: 
Plants Choke on too Much Carbon.  Carbohydrate content increases...anyone out there with Diabetes take notice?

3.
CO2 Kills--it is Toxic!

CO2 is a pollutant. 

CO2 is an Asphyxiant...it replaces Oxygen as it settles in rooms, basements, etc. ... 53% heavier than dry air.
.
ALL ANIMALS ON EARTH EXHALE CO2 to dispose of this Poisonous waste product, 
JUST LIKE pee and poop! 
Who proposes that we relish Pee or Poop like they say ‚ÄúCO2 is the GAS OF LIFE‚Äù?

CO2 kills since it IS a poison
It kills since it IS an asphyxiant
(heavier than air, it smothers life) (the higher the level of CO2, the lower the level of Oxygen)

EVERY LARGE Building ON EARTH is MANDATED TO HAVE A Fresh Air re-circulation system!  In order to fight the VERY HARMFUL effects of CO2 settling in basements and SEALED ROOMS‚Ä¶lethargy, sleepiness, dizzy spells, falls, fainting, severe headaches & Worse.

AS atmospheric CO2 levels increase, so does the THREAT of CO2 in basements, closed rooms, in protected valleys/glades.
Humans were created and evolved entirly in the Gas Levels of 180ppm to 300ppm! OUR entire physiology is based on THOSE numbers...180ppm-300ppm.
There have been no long term studies to determine the effects of dramatically higher CO2 & other Gas Levels on HUMAN DNA/Disease resistance etc.

""Police: Carbon dioxide led to death in McDonald's bathroom. STORY HIGHLIGHTS: The carbon dioxide built up to toxic levels in the bathroom An 80-year-old woman died after the incident September 7, lethal dose of carbon dioxide, authorities said Wednesday....""

CO2 is heavier than air, so the concentration near the floor will be much higher,"" as well as protected glades, basements and sealed rooms.

""Higher Concentrations of CO2 in the Atmosphere increases incidents of threatening concentrations at ground levels and basements...""

""One person, 
recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into a basement area where the gas had accumulated, said they ‚Äúfell down DEAD as if they had been shot.‚Äù

EVERY large building on EARTH has Fresh Air Re-Circulation Systems in order to fight off the Negative effects of CO2 build-up!
...the higher concentrations of CO2 & other atmospheric gasses increase the threat from CO2 build up in buildings, basements, sealed rooms and protected glades."""

Especially the bigger corporations with the most powerful lobbyist activities. It seems counterintuitive but Big Oil is tapping into government subsidies for renewable projects while watching oil global demand soar! 

The dichotomy oil industry vs governments is a naive, ignorant and false one. 

In fact, in 2000 the fossil fuels mix in global energy was about 86% and after 22 years (2022) of regulations, cap and trade schemes, trillions of $s in subsidies, fines, emission-related vehicle registration costs, taxes on fossil fuels, etc, etc, the global energy mix is now at 84% fossil fuels and with today's 84% being greater (in globally consumed volumes of fossil fuels)  than the 86% of 2000 since overall global energy demand is much higher than back then.

1. Rebranding. They keep rebranding the message with the same fear tactic. First it was ""The second ice age is coming"", then it was ""global warming"" now its ""climate change."" Anytime there is a weather incident they label it ""climate change"" and that's just nuts. (Example, the flood in Kentucky this year, they said it was climate change because they hadn't had a flood like that in 1,200 years...so 1,200 years ago there was climate change?)
2. Money. It seems like the people pushing it...are always the ones making money off the change. That's a huge red flag for me.
3. Pop culture. Not a day goes by I don't see an article tying ""climate change"" to ""racial equity"". (eye roll) It's just such a buzz word that they cram into everything. These people say ""trust the science"" then they can't explain the science. Every decade we get a crazy person saying the world will end in 12 years..and then 20 years later we're all still here (go rewatch ""An Inconvenient Truth"". Did it hold up?)

I think we should be more focused on sustainability, that's practical, but fear mongering isn't the way to go. The truth is, astral scientists say there is far more effects on the weather done by the moon and the orbiting cycle of the earth around the sun than anything else."

"ButchNackley","2022-09-14T08:00:03Z","The Green New Deal is all a scam to increase taxes on the public. Right along with the WEF. The fact is that newer ICE vehicles produce far less CO2 than they did 40 years ago. They are less expensive to produce, have a longer lifespan, are easier to maintain. EV's on the other hand, have a larger carbon footprint than the ICE, overall. They do not last very long, are expensive to service and not something the average DIY'er can maintain. The lies we're told about CO2 is also quite telling. For instance, Mt St Helens eruption released more CO2 than mankind has since our dawn. CO2 is vital to life on earth. Global Warming is just the latest trick to put fear into the people. It greatly benefits the government, as they can get away with insider trading, thus making them richer. They can skew the results of studies in their favor, since they hold the purse. Many independent studies have proven man made GW/CC simply isn't true. Earth has natural cycles of warming and cooling and always has. Of course many of these honest studies have been buried, hidden away from the public eye. You can find them, but you have to do a lot of searching. Google knows quite well how to hide facts from us.

Read the UNFCCC's agreement making IPCC THE climate change authority, and IPCC's early reports.

The rise in CO2 doesn`t correlate with any rise in temp. There`s been around a 40% increase in CO2 over the last 100 years or so and obviously not a 40% rise in temperature.
There are massive non-climate effects of CO2 which is very good for the planet and is not taken into account, the earth is growing greener because of CO2 which is extremely important, it`s increasing agricultural yields which has an obvious beneficial effect.

He _could_ have spent that $100k on building clean water wells in Africa, buying mosquito nets, providing housing for families, buying medicine for needy people, etc. Things that would have had a real, tangible, positive effect on the world. Instead, he chose to do something that only benefits himself, and pretty much just made himself _feel_ better. 

For all the grief liberals give conservatives about not following science, it's hard to find another group that bases their decisions and beliefs on feelings more than progressives and environmentalists."

"imj tapcir","2021-11-15T00:56:12Z","Food for Thought!
Right now the average wind farm is about 150 turbines.

Each wind turbine needs 80 gallons of oil as lubricant and we're not talking about vegetable oil, this is a PAO synthetic oil based on crude... 12,000 gallons of it. That oil needs to be replaced once a year.

It is estimated that a little over 3,800 turbines would be needed to power a city the size of New York... That's 304,000 gallons of refined oil for just one city.  Now you have to calculate every city across the nation, large and small, to find the grand total of yearly oil consumption from ""clean"" energy.  Where do you think all that oil is going to come from, the oil fairies?

Not to mention the fact that the large equipment needed to build these wind farms run on petroleum. As well as the equipment required for installation, service, maintenance, and eventual removal. 

And just exactly how eco-friendly is wind energy anyway?  Each turbine requires a footprint of 1.5 acres, so a wind farm of 150 turbines needs 225 acres; In order to power a city the size of NYC you'd need 57,000 acres; and who knows the astronomical amount of land you would need to power the entire US. All of which would have to be clear-cut land because trees create a barrier & turbulence that interferes with the 20mph sustained wind velocity necessary for the turbine to work properly (also keep in mind that not all states are suitable for such sustained winds). Boy, cutting down all those trees is gonna anger a lot of green-loving tree-huggers.

Let's talk about disposal now. The lifespan of a modern, top quality, highly efficient wind turbine is 20 years. 

After that, then what? What happens to those gigantic fiber composite blades?   They cannot economically be reused, refurbished, reduced, repurposed, or recycled so guess what..? It's off to special landfills they go.

And guess what else..? They're already running out of these special landfill spaces for the blades that have already exceeded their usefulness. Seriously! Those blades are anywhere from 120 ft. to over 200 ft. long and there are 3 per turbine. And that's with only 7% of the nation currently being supplied with wind energy. Just imagine if we had the other 93% of the nation on the wind grid... 20 years from now you'd have all those unusable blades with no place to put them... Then 20 years after that, and 20 years after that, and so on. 

How green is that?

I almost forgot about the 500,000 birds that are killed each year from wind turbine blade collisions; most of which are endangered hawks, falcons, owls, geese, ducks, and eagles.  Apparently smaller birds are more agile and able to dart and dodge out of the way of the spinning blades, whereas the larger soaring birds aren't so lucky.

I'm sure the wildlife conservationist folks are just ecstatic about that.

I'm so glad the wind energy people are looking out for the world.  Thank you John Kerry. And this doesn‚Äôt take into account the need for each turbine to operate at 75% efficiency for a minimum of 60 years just to off-set the co2 emissions created in its manufacture; but hang on, each turbine only has a life expectancy of 20 years . . . oops!!!

"PanhandleJake","2023-02-02T04:34:38Z","@Steve Wilson Babbling?  I am actively LEARNING about climate predictions and policies being put in place.   Below, I explain what I have LEARNED by researching climate modelling and assessments of these models by other experts  
--> Please respond with solid information that refutes any of the following points and I am open to changing any of my positions. 

Climate IS changing, but our understanding of the causes and interactions is poor, evidenced by the very limited accuracy of necessary climate models.  Climate IS complex and CO2 contribution is one of MANY factors (heating, cooling, energy storage, etc).  The specific factors involved have not changed for eons - HOW they each interact has changed greatly.  If our understanding was as clear as you state, climate models would be much more accurate than they currently are over several different (historical time periods.  Due to the MANY factors that influence climate, models are necessary to demonstrate the quality of understanding for the highly complex interactions of these many factors.  The current models show some LIMITED agreement over the last 50 year trend, a very SHORT time period from Earth's recent climate history and which has also been a rather consistent trend that is mathematically easier to fit.  Earth's climate history has MUCH greater changes than that shown by the current 50 year trend.  As I mentioned, earlier, confidence in a model's predictions comes from accurate fitting of a model to multiple DIFFERENT past trends in Earth's history.  This has not been done so CONFIDENCE in the model predictions, and therefore our understanding of Earth's climate, is LOW.  
To help -- the current climate models fit to a very small portion of recent climate history.  This is analogous to estimating your car gas mileage from just driving into your garage.  Is that data relevant?  Yes.  Is that result accurate?  Possibly but doubtful.  Should we place high confidence in the estimate?  NO - because of the very limited data that has been used.  More data from multiple different driving conditions is needed to build sufficient confidence so that GOOD judgements can be made from the better estimate.  
The current climate models are in a LIMITED CONFIDENCE situation like this gas mileage analogy.  

The low confidence in our understanding tells us that we can not predict how any of our proposed policies will impact climate.  Because of the complexities in our climate demonstrated by significantly large changes throughout Earth's history we MIGHT make positive changes, but it is much more likely that climate policies will have zero to very low impact on our complex planet.  

Also as I had mentioned, it is MUCH more CERTAIN that the current climate policies are guaranteed to harm many people - specifically the poorest on our planet.  Are you ok with telling those people to accept their consequences so that you can feel a little more (& likely false) comfort?  


If it were you and your family who were told to accept poor quality of life from these policies, would you accept this if you were also told that there was low confidence that your sacrifice would ever benefit anyone?  

Another indicator has been how the elites who are lecturing us on the dire catastrophe ahead of us are behaving.  They tell us that we are all inflicting great harm while they continue to fly many private jets around the world, maintain several homes, etc.  Their BEHAVIOR shows that they are actuality not worried.  If they truly believed what they are selling to you, they would be behaving MUCH DIFFERENTLY. Their behavior instead  shows that they are taking advantage of the situation, and of us, to benefit themselves."

"Weesel71","2022-05-18T03:26:48Z","@Ted O'Brien The funny thing about greenhouse gases. I've read several books and articles where the authors point out that these gases are necessary for plant life. Moreover, whenever they got high in the past, the world experienced an agricultural revolution which led to improved lifestyles, trade, cultural development, etc. The most recent, as I recall, was the Warm Period of the Middle Ages. When it ended, it was followed by a mini ice age which was kinda sucky. I totally agree that the earth is somewhat fragile and we can't go mistreating it forever, but it does have a lot of its own tricks up its sleeve!  You take care."

skeptic/contrarian repeated FAILED PREDICTIONS!
.
Skeptic Dr. David Evans, a former climate modeler for the Government‚Äôs Australian Greenhouse Office, says global warming predictions have been vastly exaggerated in error.

.
The academic, from Perth, Australia, who has passed 'six degrees' (levels of training, not university degrees) in applied mathematics, claims he

has analyzed complex mathematical assumptions 
widely used to predict global warming-induced climate change  (?) 
-and-  

HE predicted (a decade ago) that world temperatures will 
.
1.----->""STAGNATE"" up until '2017' 
.
2. -------> ""Before COOLING"" dramatically.  The Grand Solar Minimum is coming, the Skeptics proclaim----------So, like the 80s, the 90s, 2007-2009


We'll be up to our assets in a ‚Äòmini Ice age‚Äô by 2017.
.
""...Evans is One of the world‚Äôs ""leading climate change experts"" 
according to Propaganda sites: 
Daily Caller, Breitbart, New American, PJ Media, Twitchy, Townhall---
claims to have discovered mathematical anomalies 
which effectively ‚Äò DISPROVE ‚Äô global warming.""
.
Dr. David Evans ""has analyzed complex mathematical assumptions widely used to predict climate change ""  
-and-  
HE is predicting ""world"" temperature will "" STAGNATE "" UP UNTIL '2017'   before "" COOLING "" Dramatically,

.
We'll be KNEE DEEP in a "" Major Cold  Age "" 
.
Dr. Evans is NOT a climatologist but rather a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, with a Math undergraduate degree.  
(( Electrical Engineering..like Tony Heller (( aka  Steven Goddard )) ...also routinely wrong about predictions ))

(( THIS Prediction was made in the '80s by SKEPTIC Scientists & DENIERS,  
& THIS Prediction was made in the 1990s & again for 2007-2009 by SKEPTIC/DENIERS CHRISTY & SPENCER ))

Now here it is again.....up until 2017 temperatures are supposed to stagnate and then decline. (?)

I'm not worried about 1¬∞ here or there in and of itself the worry is that we reach a tipping point where the poles start melting and we are left with very little permanent ice. And tbh with all the other associated pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels if in 50 years they decide the models were wrong I think we'll have improved the world/technology so much it'll be worth it anyway. I love your common sense thinking/reporting Stosel but I don't think this an issue you should be arguing might not exist, by all means go after the extreme ends but I really don't think you can argue global warming isn't going to have a profound impact."

Climate change advocates ask for higher efficiency of our society when it comes to energy use.  Is that a crime?  It makes economic sense and it better for our environment.  Deniers clearly could not care less about the environment.  
The fossil fuel industry only wants to sell more oil to make more money.  They could not care less about our planet. They have 0 sense of responsibility for their actions.  They are not the future of humanity.  They are morally bankrupt and are incapable of progressing as businesses.  Tesla, solar companies, wind farms are growth industries, not the oil industries.  They are no longer of interests to investors.  They are have been companies.
 
Implementing climate change policies are win win long term but deniers like you don't want to make any effort whatsoever because you feel entitled to wasting energy and polluting like it is a god given right.  Deniers are the ""can't do"" people.  They cannot imagine future tech and better ways to live.  They are the same people that claimed that emissions controls on car would be the end of them.  That turned out to be complete BS.  

The world population will peak around 11 billion and that will require some serious agriculture improvement in order to be able to feed them reliably. So far the climate has been predictable.  Ignoring climate change is a threat as the climate could change to the point were some regions would no longer be appropriate for growing plants we will be screwed.   
Ocean acidification and warming are clearly happening and are having profound effects on the oceans' ecosystem and not in a positive way.
Agriculture in the US is being stressed by the new record breaking in rain fall and higher temperature.  Forget about being the bread basket of the world, the US may end up not being able to feed itself.  

Fossil fuel apologists and deniers will be held liable in the end.  They will go down in history as those who were too arrogant to see what was happening under their very noses and who refused to take actions when they could have been taken.  

Deniers think that pumping 40Giga tons of C02 in the atmosphere per year every year and increasing at an exponential rate is just fine.  Nothing to see here.  Trash the planet is their motto.

Clearly, none of these deniers ski or they would be able to tell that the snowpack around the world is disappearing. In Europe, the ski season has shrunk by 1/3 since the 70s thanks to anthropomorphic climate change.  Glaciers in the Himalayas are disappearing. They are crucial to watering India and feeding 1.4 billion people.  Should they disappear, these 1.4 billion people are going to have serious problems growing food.  

But go ahead Stossel, make fun of all that since you could not care less if people around the world die as long as you can get your fill.  Science was clearly never your strength."

Even if the climate models are wrong, burning fossil fuels is stupid. Doubling the CO2 levels causes serious health issues no matter what the temperature does. Do we really want to live in a world where we need to carry around breathing equipment? 

CO2 levels went from 275 PPM in 1600 CE to 420 today. Higher CO2 levels reduce mental acuity and increase blood acidity. This effect becomes noticeable at 600 PPM. So unless the current trend of rising CO2 levels changes, we will all be stupid. Of course this is at 420 PPM outside. CO2 levels inside can be much higher. Many struggle with this problem today without knowing or understanding why. 

Rising CO2 levels are bad for humans."

What should worry us are the stupid responses made by politicians to this ‚Äúproblem.‚Äù We should despair at the policies they are enacting to reduce our carbon emissions. For example, in Britain the twats in Government have banned the sale of all new petrol & diesel cars from 2030 onwards. Cruise ships and flights for vacations are being phased out from 2040 onwards. Farming of beef and lamb is also being phased out. 

But none of these things will happen in the developing world. Both China and India will be buying new petrol cars in the future. Meat consumption is steadily increasing in developing countries and no changes are planned. No banning of flights in these places either. 

So what good will it do if the advanced countries live a more Spartan life if the fast developing countries carry on as before?

You probably think that helps but it doesnt, its the opposite.

Obviously this is sarcasm here. 
I cant be bothered to watch the video again because I think it gave me a tumor in my brain. But if i remember properly the things he goes on about is the predictions that have not come true. Like the 20ft of sea level rise by a certain amount of time. I criticise that bullshit as well. I am politically very central and that enables me to criticise both sides of politics and try to come to a middle ground. I think that picking a side when talking about politics is useless and very american. and so I refrain from doing so. and i also think most people are middle ground they just get sucked into believing that they are left wing or something. 
The thing that really saddens me is that people pick a side and then suck the dick completely of the BLM riots because they think it will support their cause and then are shocked when they find out that crime has gone up since. 

My main point is that they marry the cause but dont criticise its bad behaviour either. like come one people. In order to make a change you have to criticise your own cause as much as possible to find out if it is fool proof or not and then improvements to their policy must be made. (Defund the police? Can you be any more fucking retarded than that hashtag. Fuckin leftists. police increase the life expectancy of a community just by existing)

It shows a terrible inability to steer the argument to what you think is acceptable. instead america spends time attacking the other side instead of using manipulation to get more support from those people. If its about the gays or something else that i dont completely support. what i do is immediately say ""Look we dont want the gays to be punished for being themselves but can we stop thinking that gender and gender rolls are fluid. its absurd to think that. The rule should instead be that all babies are their gender until 18 and then they can legally identify as not normal and then put the OTHER option as their gender""
that is pretty much what i do.
and i do the same with climate stuff
I say that the fossil fuel industries have pushed for years to spread disinformation and either by a desperation or a stupidity the scientists have come out and said the earth will die by 2025 or something. they are full of shit and are just scaremongering and i criticise them for it.
But the truth is that renewable energy has been getting cheaper than coal for a decade now and It could/is likely to become the first energy grid that doesnt have to be government subsidized to start up. whereas the gas and coal industries have had to have government subsidies for decades to start up. 
the gas and coal plants regularly fail and we still have blackouts because of overheating in the coal power stations. batteries are the solution to baseload power which can stabilise the grid until the energy comes back online.
What i will steer the argument to is that the climate change debate is a classic example of the leaders who are much more intelligent than the general population steering the argument to benefit their cause. such as the democrats going for the climate change votes and the republicans going for the anti climate change votes.
when in reality none of them care about the facts.

the climate on earth has changed constantly. No one smart is denying that. even farmers are saying this. The thing we are concerned about is the rate of change. the climate was significantly hotter than it was I don't know how many millions of years before this and then it was heaps cold in the ice age. what this all means is that messing around with gases in the earth creates a cycle and we know that lots of carbon promotes tree growth which leads to less carbon in the air which leads to cooling. but this cycle also results in the deaths of millions of animals and that is not what i want to see. they need the evolutionary time to adapt to the change in temperature which has risen faster than it gives them to survive extinction.
The climate has changed since gases were emitted to the air En masse a hundred years ago and they will continue to climb for the rest of human existence until it is either phased out or unnecessary. the climate on earth is very complex and unreliable and it is not unreasonable to think that adding more carbon to the air might result in some consequences good or bad and we should keep that in mind. 
Even if the projection is like 100 years from now or 200 years the oceans will be deserts(figure of speech) then I still think its worth it to remove the gas that pollutes the city and makes it smell bad. even from a community aspect it is better to remove these polluters from our lives. and who does keeping oil or nuclear energy benefit. It certainly doesnt benefit you. It will benefit people who have a stranglehold on the resource sector and you have nothing to benefit from it. what is more free than solar energy. you cant get more free market than whats free. It will allow people to invest heavily into solar and the public will be able to make a profit from it. without millions of dollars of energy companies holding the energy until the price goes higher to drive up the profits (this is shithouse economics by the way)
the politicians trying to make the change are not just going to dump everyone in the coal jobs on their arse before changing. (or at least in my country they are not)
they make a responsible transition.
and by responsible I mean moving straight to renewable energy and not betraying us by investing into gas which is more expensive for us than exporting it because other countries pay a higher price. 
climate is not going to affect us as rapidly as al gore said. but im not going to let the people who have the most to benefit from selling a countries resources get rich off of it with no benefit to the population.

so there is my argument. its a pretty sick argument ey. thank you for supporting me."

But, that so -called agreement among them comes from going off of ponied - up stats that concur with what they want to believe. Very few of these ''97%'' are actually climatologist, and some of them are not scientist in any sense of the word. On top of this, we have the leftist political view [ or opinion ] about 'never letting a good crisis go to waste'. It is when unbounded and unscrupulous politicians get their hands on your money they take from you { in the form of taxes, fees, penalties, licenses, whatever } to ''fix'' the global warming crisis that the real problem starts.

Now they say ""well we all agree its getting warmer but its not dangerous!"" In another 10 years they will say ""well, who needs the Philippines and Indonesia anyway? If they walk around in  5 feet of water, thats their problem!""

Btw, if the water would rise 5 feet, hundreds of millions of people would become refugees. And, the golf current or other warm currents could change their routes. that would mean that we could lose 20 degrees latitude as both farmland and possibly habitable land. 

So on top of the hundreds of millions of refugees, alot of Canada, scandinavia, Russia, Mongolia and probably other places im not familiar with, would become inhospitable due to permafrost. And on top of that, there would be significantly less food in the world. Just imagine if the midlands, all of Iowa and whatever other farmland ares of the US suddenly lost 10% of their crop because their season became shorter and the ground colder. That`s famine."

"Mac Thompson","2021-04-11T23:07:52Z","But thats on BOTH sides. I worked in animal racing. I can point you to ""experts"" on both sides that are pro racing, or anti racing. All the statistics on stuff about horse racing being okay is funded by pro horse racing people. There are even a few schools that teach veterinary sports medicine. Thats BIAS baked right into the education. Confirmation Bias and Group think.

Whos the expert about such a thing? A person who wins races? A vet? An animal behavior expert? And animal care professional? A horse trainer? Lots of people who ride horses think racing is cruel. But it continues to be a thing.

My educated and informed opinion tells me that the act of racing is cruel, animals keep dying and the care standards are low AF. In normal society we put people in jail for treating animals like this. We call it hoarding, or animal abuse, or puppy milling(i worked in dog sled racing). Its literally illegal to work an animal to death in most places. Yet dozens of horses die on race tracks every year in the US alone. The animal racing industry mirrors the animal fighting industry is more ways than it doesnt. Its barbaric.  


And about climate change. Most scientists agree humans have altered the climate. I don't even think thats really a debate anymore. Whats debatable is whats best to do moving forward. But ""that'd be cheap to fix."" What a crock. To clean a stretch of oil polluted river or something it costs millions or more. And it has potential to ruin lives. It has in places like the amazon where oli companies have left indigious people in pretty bad ways. Birth defects and cancers. Lasting environmental changes that effect the wildlife and landscape indefinitely. Toxins that don't break down polluting ground water. Stuff like that is NOT cheap or easy to fix. Mining and oil companies and RUINED alot of land to the point to where its not safe to live anymore. Accidents happen, but we can't let these big companies do crap like than and get away with it.

From an animal standpoint, because thats what I know about, We have WRECKED wildlife over the past 150 years. Loads of species extinct. Sever drops in numbers in prolific species. Humans are really good at wrecking stuff. Animal are part of the sytem that balances everything. Its about more than being a bunny hugger. Removing animals like bears and bison are critical to spreading seeds of the plants they eat. So you know out the right critter like a bird or bear in a certain area. You alter the landscape and species distribution. Wild fruits used to be fairly common in the us, not anymore. The mechanisms that allow those species to proliferate have been altered, few animals eating and spreading the seeds, alteration of the landscapes and water table. We have deforested pretty much the entire united states. Its wacky how much we have changed it and people act like Climate change isn't real. We have literally changed this giant country from coast to coast in very little time."

Centuries of Humans Pumping TOXIC Gasses & Chemicals into our atmosphere, 
the Vast Majority are sourced to Human Heavy Industry & COAL Electric Power Generation.

When we are considering the state of the environment, all studies are relevant. The individual scientists or groups of them studying specific topics like, the ones who study amphibians, for instance... they aren't comparing notes with the 'melting ice' scientists or the 'ocean salinity' scientists or the 'high altitude particulate' scientists, or the 'rate of crop failures' scientists, or even NASA. ALL of the collected scientific studies of land and sea and air phenomenon and trends must be collated, cross-referenced and organized. I have watched countless climate change discussions and it many concentrate on only a small part of the available information. But Guy McPherson has put much effort into gathering and comparing the findings of many many studies from across the spectrum of fields. If we are to believe in science, his conclusions are worthy of our attention. I really enjoy how Mr. Stossel presents his little videos. This one, though, is not a favourite."

If humans are responsible, and keep on this path, will there be *much more* warming in the next 50-100 years? Yes.

Will climate change hurt everyone? Probably not.  Canada, with under 40 million people, will see a longer growing season.  But India, Indonesia, Africa, and Australia, where BILLIONS live, will face days where it is dangerous to merely be outside because its so hot.  The US west will face more catastrophic fires.  The sea will rise to cover parts of coastal counties in the US and elsewhere.

Well, for coastal countries it could be really bad. Also, fossil fuels increase acidity which destroys planktons which can be really bad. I say, go nuclear and reduce fossil fuel consumption.

2) What is the hurry with fossil fuel consumption? Fossil fuel will not disappear and it is limited. Why not path the way for our descendants to meet their energy needs when fossil fuel is gone? It is selfish to over-consume limited commodity just to feel good now but our future children to suffer. I say go nuclear.

3) It is a stupid argument to look at a small scale to check if the temperature rise is dangerous. Maybe it is not at the moment but if the trend continues it could be catastrophic and even Judith Curry agrees with that.

"Ari S","2021-02-16T10:26:30Z","Okay so to sum up: climate change is slow, and Stossel and his guests are not sure if the rise in temperatures will be harmful.

Here's the other side - the global temperature rise in the last 100 years has not happened at this speed for 5000 years. We covered a 4 degree rise in the last 5000 years (0.08 degrees per century). In the last 100 years we saw a rise of 0.7 degrees.

TLDR - the process is speeding up. Now, this may seem like a small amount, but bear in mind - this is global average temperature (including temperatures from the extreme places like the Arctic / Egypt). Even a degree increase means a much higher temperature in hotter regions.

Okay that's fine - but is it harmful? Stossel and his guests are right, it's not easy to say. This is a change which usually happens over thousands of years, and it's hard to understand exactly what will go wrong. However, the answer does not seem to be ""nothing"". Lets keep in mind that human beings were born and evolved over the last 300,000 years, following a slow rise in temperatures. We've never really seen a major temperature variance over such a short duration.

Another thing scientists agree on is that life on earth helps maintain the temperature. Before life existed, the climate of our planet was weird - everything was either lava or it rained for a million years. In a way, all the plants and trees have helped create a temperature necessary for survival.

And we have suddenly destroyed all of it. 90 percent of wildlife areas have vanished over the last few hundred years, with entire species getting wiped out overnight. This is obviously why we are seeing an accelerated temperature rise. Let's be very clear about one thing - if we destroy all the other species on our planet, we will definitely go extinct.

So keeping the above history and context in mind, we can agree on one thing - this is definitely a real problem that needs to be headed off at the pass. Not being able to understand the change is not a good enough excuse to ignore it. I agree with Stossel and his guests that maybe we can be a little less thuggish about how we discuss this topic, but the simple fact is that if the balance of life is disturbed, life for human beings will get worse.

TLDR: Climate change is real. We may not know how it impacts us, but we do know that it impacts us."

Deforestation is real, which is leading to habitat destruction that is excelerating the extinction of hundreds of species far faster than natural causes.
Our oceans are heavily polluted with plastic, the Gulf of Mexico is severly polluted with oil and agricultural runoff. Fish stocks are being depleted faster than they can reproduce. Coral reefs are being destroyed
These ecosystems are critical to the natural balance that allows us to live on this planet, we can't just brush this off as inconsequencial.
The good news is new research is moving away from the idea of cutting emissions and towards sequestation, drawing CO2 back into the Earth. It's done through cleaning up the oceans and improving farming methods by making soil more CO2 absorbent, far cheaper and effective than wind turbines and solar panels"

""industrial revolution charts perfectly aligning on each other, rising sea levels and melting Arctic ice."" I'm not saying industrialization didn't lead to an increase in co2 levels. What I'm saying we don't know the actual effect on a global scale and all the predictions have been wrong meaning we have no clue if it will do anything. Also currently the global arctic ice is down by 3% compared to the average for the last 200 years, according to our co2 levels and what they are supposed to do according to ""scientists"" then they should be way lower, there should be at least a reduction of 50% yet that is also wrong.

If there's one thing we learn about giant chaotic systems with a multitude of variables is that one tiny change in a single variable can cause very big changes to the whole system that are practically impossible to predict (butterfly effect). 
We can take ecosystems as an example; there have been cases in which people, simply by introducing foreign bacteria into a new environment destroyed an entire ecosystem. Nobody could have possibly predicted something like that.

The climate and the multitude of complex systems which depend on the climate are all in a very fine equilibrium; an equilibrium in which humanity and most life on earth has evolved and thrives under. It is very reasonable to assume that by tipping the climate, we would create very drastic changes to the natural world down the line. It is pretty much a certainty. What these changes will be and when they will come, nobody can say in the moment. But rest assured that a change in the environment in which are bodies have evolved for millions of years cannot be a good thing. The right thing to do is to respect the equilibrium of nature. Neglecting this issue just because we cannot exactly predict the consequences is a big mistake. And what is the reason to neglect these issues? Simply greed and the desire for more. More production, more money, more comforts, eat more, move faster, reproduce at any cost and fuck everything and anyone ."

"John Lile","2020-12-19T19:11:44Z","In science, you can usually find a dissenting opinion. Stossel‚Äôs covered the alarmists quite well and funding behind it, he always gets my attention. We know the models have too many variables to predict with any certainty, esp what directions countries and politicians will go in, so it makes scientists job even more difficult with models. Not sure that should be the main focus. What Stossel‚Äôs didn‚Äôt touch on are the Climate Deniers and the big money funding them. Start with the Koch brothers, and the 156 members of Congress who have signed the pledge to not tax them, but let the public clean up the mess (see Dark Money). Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and mostly Republicans have signed the pledge.But there are plenty of other big oil players, dirty coal companies that are funding politicians and their campaigns, and don‚Äôt want their companies to die out either. It reminds me of the tactics the tobacco companies used in denying their products caused higher rates of cancer.  Stossel‚Äôs just skips the Denier side with big oil and others funding such politicians, doesn‚Äôt even cover that aspect with this piece. We do know the high CO2 levels are unprecedented, see NASA‚Äôs site, and why our oceans are warming, coral reefs are dying off, many animal and insect populations are on the decline, to say nothing of what consequences it‚Äôs going to have on our tree and plant species. Most scientists readily admit their models are far from perfect, but most are very concerned.   What are the consequences of doing nothing to the unprecedented rising  CO2 levels and what will it be like by year 2100? It doesn‚Äôt look good and deserves our full attention. I‚Äôm a big fan of Stossel‚Äôs, but feel like he didn‚Äôt cover this well or balanced at all, unlike many of his other pieces. I hope he‚Äôll do a future piece, esp cover the funding of who is behind the Climate Deniers and what is at stake for them."

So IF it all melts, and IF all of it goes into ocean, the water rises 2100.* 0.03/0.7 = 90 meters. The height of Statue of Liberty is 93 meters. This So Neil Tyson is being generous.
John Stossel is wrong and right at the same time. He hand picks various models (model is what it is a model , it has a lot of uncertainty) and mocks that it did not materialize. This is  also data manipulation of a kind to re-enforce a certain point (that scientists are full of shit). 
Yes, the problem is very politicized, he is right. Yes, there are lot of grifters in scientific community (and naturally in business) who benefit from the hype personally . But look at the bright side. If under ""Green Tyranny"" we get rid of burning fossil fuels to extract energy - a huge win. This old tech. that is out of date and we need to move on.  Sustainable energy extraction industry emerges and brings jobs with it , so it is not all doom and gloom and closed traditional power plants."

The World isn't coming to an end....BUT the geo magnetic pole IS moving, close to 1,000 feet a day, and for the 1st time in 781k years, it is changing.  If you research what happens next, after it flips polarization, then you begin to understand why AOC said what she said.....she simply was Parroting what the CIA/FBI told her, and the rest of the Congressmen present during that particular meeting....she should not have said anything.  Now you know the REAL reason we have been throwing TRILLIONS of dollars at Musk(Space Sat's 42,000 sat system)and the rest to build a man made replacement to the Van Allen Belt, which happens to reflect the lethal rays of the Sun.  It goes away, the EXPERTS say for up to 1,000 years, so now you know why 37 Billionaires have built bunkers in New Zealand.  Your Government is spending money like a drunken sailor, because......they'll never have to pay it back.   The New Green Deal has us replacing virtually all the buildings in N. America, look it up.....I call them mud huts, very energy efficient BUT also radiation proof, if you have to change every industry on Earth, due to a completely FALSE premise....it's really something else they are doing, and in this case, it's pay no attention to man behind the curtain.....the poles are going to magnetically shift/flip, and when that really happens, they won't be able to lie to us anymore.  You have 10 years......that's what the experts say, but they really don't know, it could be a lot longer than that, but not more than 50-60 years, and THAT assumes the pole stabilizes, something it isn't doing, it's accelerating.  It has 7,500 miles left to go.  NOAA maintains a web site to monitor this, far more important than watching hurricanes.  I suggest reading the thesis papers from Geo Physics Doctorial candidates , or Geo Magnetic experts aspiring to become Doctors to confirm the dangers here, and wonder if you will know how violent the World's geo structure might well be that sad day.

It‚Äôs already eroding the ocean floor basically melting away all the calcium carbonate ocean creatures use to make shells. If the ocean becomes too acidic it will kill any life within it in certain parts. Once the food chain is disrupted it will create major problems and food shortages in parts of the world where they depend on the ocean to supply them with their meals.

So I make the prediction now that at some point in the future this will happen again. I don't see how that is a far-fetched prediction, it's a natural occurrence after all.
Should humans then try to stop it if they can?

If your answer is no, then you would rather the natural change of the climate continue devastating ecosystems than try to conserve the ecosystems we have. What is the moral difference between this and letting the alarmist future you predict happen?

If your answer is yes, then we are in  a whole new world where humans have responsibility for controlling and choosing what the climate should be.

"EvoCultiva","2020-12-01T21:22:23Z","@Gustavo Rodarte Palma A Lot of things. Wean off our oil dependency, reduce meat intake as a species (there are plenty of more efficient sources of protein out there that don‚Äôt produce greenhouse gasses and aren‚Äôt responsible for deforestation), take advantage of agricultural practices that already exist and are in use in places like Holland in order to avoid energy intensive and environmentally damaging food production. We could implement more public transport systems in American cities, we could invest in renovating and repairing our electrical grid and energy infrastructure that is outdated in order to improve our grids efficiency. There‚Äôs tons of steps we could be taking that would be not only good for the environment, but could provide jobs, create new industries, and save us from the long term economic costs of climate change which will be high."

BUT,
They are lying.
There are various temp trends on various planets...up and down.
.
In this Milankovitch Cycle...Earth's orbit is slowly pulling away from the sun....we should be cooling.
Earth's Axial Tilt is also away from the sun....we should be cooling.
For the last half-century, the current SOLAR CYCLE has been reduced in output....we should be cooling.

Yet, in the last century...from the 1880s to the 1980s...human measured temps rose
at a conservative 0.85C per century.
....
Skeptic Dr. John Christy 
has admitted that his satellite overview has confirmed that temps are NOW RISING, every decade by 0.14 C ....that is a century rate of 1.4 C / 100 years.

NOTE:   that is a 50% increase in the rate of warming.

Coming out of the last Glaciation...we warmed at 0.1C per century
which means we are warming today.....14 times faster than that."
"Rick Kooi","2022-05-06T15:30:18Z","That 1 C is a lot bigger than YOU think.
If we go back to when it was just 2 C cooler....we would see hundreds of feet of ice over Manhattan.

And by the way....it is about 1.4C today.
Hurricanes have increased about 10 fold.
Flooding Rain Events are up nearly 300%
Deserts are growing worldwide.
Cities around the world are spending Billions to protect against storm surges and rising seas.
Billions more are being spent to enable city and state and federal rescue systems."
"Philip Clock","2021-02-09T21:37:11Z","@Chase Manley Yes, I have. Data shows patterns but no scientific quid pro quo: PROVABLE CAUSES for weather, temperature increases, continents and oceans rising and falling that have anything to do beyond mother nature. And I'm not sacrificing my first born for anyone who claims a special relationship with her."
"Chase Manley","2021-02-08T23:46:54Z","@Philip Clock Where's the science? Have you honestly searched and not found the studies pertinent to your inquiry? Of course you haven't. And I won't do your homework for you. 

As far as ""measurable trade-offs"" go, are you suggesting that I place a dollar amount on how many people we should strive to feed, house and water in the future, and match that goal with a dollar amount we need to allocate towards solutions that actually make long-term sense? Are you asking me to devise a comprehensive plan to get from where we're at to where we need to be? Because that's not what my comment was about. 

My comment was simply saying that Stossel's view on the matter fails to accurately represent the real issues at hand. He completely misses the point of being concerned about climate change. It's not about tree-hugging hippies wasting money on feel-good kumbaya bullshit. The issues we're facing are proven threats to our species. If we're smart, we'll find a way to sustain humanity on this planet. And if we're pig-headed and insist that free-market capitalism is the answer to EVERYTHING, then we'll kill ourselves off eventually. There are some of us that would prefer the former option, and some of us that would rather bury our heads in the sand and believe that there's nothing wrong with the way we're doing things, OR that because it's expensive and difficult, that it ought not to be done. 

God forbid we eat into our profits from exploiting the planet's finite resources in order to invest in a long-term plan. I'm sure future generations will thank us for our inaction üëç"

The switch to green isn't easy and its not cheap but we need to find an economical sound solution. Not the green new deal. We need to instead of building another dirty coal power plant (ik some run pretty clean but trust me ik ones that really don't im from wv the literal coal state) we need to look at building maybe a nuclear power plant. We need to develop a new type of battery for electric cars so they go farther and the battery degradation isn't bad. Its not an easy path to go down. Ik trust me. However it is the right one."

"Papa Bilby","2020-09-15T20:18:55Z","I usually agree with the right but this is one I cant get on board with. Scientists are telling us that the problem with climate change is the rate by which it is happening. Yes temperatures have been this warm before but it happened very gradually. Same with the C02 content of the atmosphere. The rate at which C02 is being dumped into the atmosphere is very toxic and dangerous and yes we are the cause of that. I watch this channel because he seems to be trying to be unbiased, but I just don‚Äôt beleive this guy doesn‚Äôt know the actual reasons scientists are warning us. This seemed disingenuous. All the ‚Äúclimate apocalypses‚Äù the guy mentioned are all from C02 content in the atmosphere yet he thinks all those things will never happen. Acid rain, raising ocean levels, and losing the ice caps are all still going to happen if something doesn‚Äôt change."

Because if this is your reasen, why boy make it 10 or 100 degrees hotter. And look at the dry places in Afrika that years ago where wet. I agree with you on deregulation, the problems of big goverment. And I get why the issue of climate change challenges those ideas so much that you want to deny it.

I'm not an American but I have watched some of your videos and i actually agreed with a lot of them, but here you're clearly wrong."
"Book Lover","2020-08-29T11:36:50Z","Ok so this video has so many confusing points. Firstly, comparing how many people die of heat and cold is pointless. Climate change isn‚Äôt just global warming, it‚Äôs also the reason for stronger hurricanes (because of warmer ocean water) and more frequent extreme weather. Both of those kill people and will cause migration as people move into areas that are safer. With the rising temperature, bees are starting to die which may cause famine. So saying that a heating planet is fine is simplifying the problem of climate change which has a much wider impact. 

Secondly, saying that there are bigger issues than climate change is also a misunderstanding of the problem. Sure, there are big immediate problems to be addressed but if we don‚Äôt address climate change we will soon face even bigger, irreversible problems. There is an article by Time which gathers evidence and shows that we only have about 10 years to stop climate change and that we are already facing its impact. It‚Äôs only going to get worse."

"Aaron Vallejo","2021-03-30T21:22:56Z","@Steven Stritenberger Perhaps we can share notes and information because I think you have information and the mentality of renewables from the early 1990's. Today wind turbines are 650 feet tall with a nameplate capacity of 4MW and 50% capacity factors each powering 1,800 homes annually. In 2015, Seimens studied the energy return of their wind turbines are found onshore wind turbines recoup all their embodied energy in 4.5 to 5.5 months of operation. Offshore wind turbines takes 10.5 months. This includes all energy needed for mining, smelting, manufacturing, shipping, transporting, building, servicing, disassembly and recycling. The CEO of Vestas last month said it was 4 months and their wind turbines operate for 30 years. 90 MW electric arc furnaces can infinitely recycle the million pounds of steel for each modern wind turbine using renewably powered electricity. Some US steel mills are now buying their electricity from wind and solar PV facilities because it is cheaper than fossil fuel electricity. Blades were being buried in Casper, Wyoming but now they are being grinded and recycled too. Solar PV panels recoup the energy used in under 2 years. As renewables receive more and more global investment and greater economies of scale their price will further decline and our regional and global economies will gradually shift to renewably powered electricity and off fossil fuels."
"Steven Stritenberger","2021-03-30T18:42:09Z","Go check figures on efficiency, waste, amount of money it takes to build one wind turbine and the amount of energy produced. They lose money, produce less than they cost to build and maintain.."

"Norman Valiao","2020-05-03T22:26:27Z","@Jenn smith With all their quirks and whining, I doubt if they have time to do such important task."
"Norman Valiao","2020-05-03T14:17:50Z","@Jenn smith That is actually true! The reason for that being is that evidence shows that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, partly driven by industrial emissions, is boosting forest growth. Satellite data¬†shows an eleven percent growth in global leaf area from 1982 to 2010. Scientists attribute most of this growth to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, there are still a fast forest decline in other countries like Mexico, South America, Africa, South East Asia, etc. The human and animal population is growing in a large scale.  What usually follows is that -- the larger increase in human population, the larger and faster industrialization will progress because demand in land and transportation will take place. Where do they get this extra land to create roads, buildings, houses, etc? Agricultural land probably, but that's a double whammy because now your food source supply will decline and at the same time you will be killing agricultural plants which is also a source for OXYGEN. Then their are others who would take advantage of large mass forest areas to build these extra roads, buildings and houses. Many countries still doesn't have laws in place to protect forest and agricultural lands. For now, the supply of OXYGEN is still stable and sustainable. What happens after 50 to 100 years especially that the aggressive worldwide laws to reduce carbon emissions are taking place? Will the remaining plants and trees have enough CO2 and will they be able to convert OXYGEN enough to supply for both human and animal population in the near future?"
"Norman Valiao","2020-05-02T15:14:12Z","@Jenn smith Basic Science of supply and demand.... Photosenthesis. In order for plants and trees to survive they need sunlight, water and carbon dioxode (CO2). What do plants and trees convert or breath-out? OXYGEN! What do humans and animal need to survive and live besides water and food? That's right!  OXYGEN! Everybody is so involved in this CO2 fiasco when we forget that OXYGEN too needs attention. Do we have enough plants and trees to breath-out OXYGEN this days? How many humans and animals are increasing every minute? Do you agree that we are now over populated? If so, do you think we will have enough OXYGEN supplied by planet Earth in the next 50 to 100 years from now? As much as you hate to admit it, we need as much CO2 in order to supply more OXYGEN which is provided by plants and trees. Problem is, plants and trees have been decreasing every year because of illegal logging, forest fires, irresponsible industrialization, deforestation, etc. By the time we find ways of decreasing CO2 emissions we will now have a new problem in OXYGEN supply. Then we say..... plant more trees and pump up more CO2 so we can get more OXYGEN! Funny how things will turn out that way."

"Bart Hillen","2020-05-01T07:12:52Z","@Jenn smith Thanks for your answer Jenn. Well, I might be a true believer, as you wish. But I have the impression that you are uneducated. I mean, real science tells us that H + 2O is water? No, water is 2H + O. This is so simple, and you fail even on that level, it's just unbelievable. I am sorry, but it seems you haven't got the faintest idea how the world and nature works and you are just plain ignorant. Asking the question ""What is the level of co2 in the atmosphere supposed to be?"", is like asking ""what is the temperature of water supposed to be?"". It's a stupid question, it is what it is. And higher CO2 levels have implications: it gets warmer. And warmer weather has also implications, like for example on crop harvests, water availability, insects etc etc. What part of this do you not understand?
You call everything Junk and BS. I have the feeling that you have not read ONE scientific article ever, because either you cannot manage to read a text longer than one page, or you think it's useless because its junk anyway! I wonder where you get your information from. I mean, more ""frikkin trees"" then ever before? Really? Can you please share your sources with me? What kind of websites are you searching for what you want to read?"
"Bart Hillen","2020-04-30T07:35:48Z","@Jenn smith Hi there! You sound angry, to be honest. The things you mention in your response seem to come straight out of the mouth of Sean Hannity. I agree with you that there is a lot of scare tactics going on when you turn on the TV. You hear doom predictions every day, like the polar bear extinction or Bangladesh under water. And when it turns out to be wrong.....crickets. I get it. 
However, I hear the same kind of doom scenarios from the other side, like the things you wrote in your response. ""The Dems want the US to become like Stalin-Russia, they want to ruin America etc"". When THAT turns out to be false (or exaggerated), it's also crickets coming from e.g. Hannity. So it seems the left AND right are both using scare tactics for their own purpose. 
Myself, I am from The Netherlands,  and we do not have left or right wing media. We have only middle of the road politicians, and MSM, who try to inform the people of The Netherlands with accurate information without attacking any political opponents. 
So maybe I am ""ancient"" and have ""no clue to what's going on"", but what makes you think that you do? It all depends on where we get our information from, right? Do you watch Fox, or CNN? I watch both, and come to the conclusion that both are often exaggerating and sometimes lying. Scientists are generally not lying, because they have no use for it. What is the point of doing research, spending years on it, and than afterwards lie about the results? The media (left and right) are the ones PRESENTING the results to the public on TV, and they both give their own spin at it. Don't blame the scientists for that, blame the media!"
"Bart Hillen","2020-04-29T07:03:49Z","@Jenn smith Jenn, first I have a genuine question for you, and I hope you want to explain this to me. You say ""create a crisis to advance the left wing agenda"". What is that agenda? And how would a (global) crisis help this agenda? I am seriously interested in your opinion on this, because I hear and read this argument all the time without anyone actually explaining what this means.  
Now your questions, first about the 0.03% CO2. If you drop the CO2 level with 25% you'd come to 0.0225% CO2 and that will likely trigger our planet into an new glacial period. How do I know? Well, you only have to look at patterns from the past. Currently we are in an interglacial period, with mild temperatures. The past 700.000 years planet earth has been through 8 glacial cycles. These cycles are driven by the CO2 concentration in the atmospere. In the warmest periods the CO2 level was 0.03% (like now) and in the coldest periods, when earth was mostly covered in ice, the CO2 level was just under 0.02%. So the 0.0225% is quiet close to this level, and would result in massive temperature drops. 
The second one is about ""scientific questions"": What do I want the climate to be, and why? Well, there is no answer to these questions, as I don't want the climate to be anything. It is irrelevant what people want, it's about understanding how things work. Look, you have to stop thinking that scientists are claiming the end of the world is near because we burn fossil fuel.  Scientists understand the mechanisms that drive our global temperatures and CO2 (and other greenhouse gasses) are the main driver. If we put more CO2 in the atmosphere, the temp goes up. Really simple common sense stuff, my friend. The predictions on the effect of higher temps on our daily life are more extreme weather, more droughts in some parts of the world, more floods in other parts, disrupted ecosystems etc. Not the end of the world, no oranges in Minnesota, but they are temperature related events that eventually will cost us (humans) a lot of money. By reducing the rise of CO2 (and thereby temperature) we can limit these negative effects and continue our lives as we are used to."

Shrinking Arctic Sea Ice
Measurements since the 1950s indicate that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has been declining. The Arctic is projected to have no summer ice cover by the middle of this century.

Check on sea ice at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

1950s-1970s	
Air Pollution Dampens Warming
Aerosols, emitted into the atmosphere from smokestacks and tailpipes, caused a slight cooling of climate, which fueled speculation that we could enter an Ice Age. As countries passed clean air legislation, aerosol pollution decreased and climate warming continued.

Heat Wave Linked to Climate Change
Researchers determined that climate change played a large role in the 2003 heatwave in Europe, which resulted in more than 30,000 deaths.

Economic Impacts of Climate Change
The Stern Review described the economic impacts of climate change, finding that mitigating (reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions) and adapting (making changes to the way we live) would be much less expensive than the cost of trying to recover from the disastrous impacts of climate change in the future.

Impacts included melting ice, thawing permafrost, and changes in ecosystems. They found that changes were especially pronounced in the Arctic.

The Effect of Climate Change on Extreme Weather
A new branch of climate science, called attribution research, formed to study how global climate change affects extreme weather events such as heat waves, hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Each year since 2011, the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society has issued a special report about extreme weather events during the past year and how the risk of severe weather has been altered by climate change.

Dwindling Biodiversity
With Earth system models, scientists are now able to study how species and ecosystems around the world are likely to be affected by climate change and other human impacts. According to a 2019 United Nations report, climate change and other human impacts such as pollution and land use are threatening species worldwide. ""Around 1 million species already face extinction, many within decades, unless action is taken,"" according to the report.

2020 Ties with 2016 as the Warmest Year On Record
2016 and 2020 tied as the warmest years on record, according to 2021 reports. Scientists studying long-term temperature records found that the 10 warmest years through 2020 all occurred since 2000. From NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Director Gavin Schmidt, ‚Äú...As the human impact on the climate increases, we have to expect that records will continue to be broken.‚Äú

"DAClarkism","2020-03-26T16:08:27Z","I love how Google feels the need to provide the Wikipedia fact-check directly below this. As if Wikipedia saying that ""Global warming is the mainly human-caused rise of..."" makes it a fact. I have no doubt that (some) scientists say that, what I do doubt is the methodologies and the stories written about the work the scientists have done. It's really easy to take a report, get the wrong main idea about it, or over-play the ideas presented, and then proliferate that into the world as reputable. It's also really easy to do junk science and then get that nonsense published, and then have that nonsense be the basis for further nonsense. 


I'm not opposed to ""man-made global warming"" on ideological grounds, I'm opposed to it on the grounds that I have as yet not seen any information where the topic has been studied from a neutral point of view, and has taken the time to first rule out all the converging environmental factors to say definitively that: A) The planet really is warming, and it's humans doing most of it. B) This is not a natural planetary cycle. C) Assuming A and B are true, that humans can actually do anything about it without causing massive death and suffering. D) Given A, B, and C, a warmer climate would actually be worse than the one we have now. If any of those things I mentioned are off, or if it turns out that daily termite respiration or some other completely inane reason has a larger effect than everything we could do, then the cure would be far worse than the disease. 


My intuition tells me that we haven't yet been able to meet the standard of proof I laid out, and considering what would need to happen if it were true, that standard of proof is not unreasonable. My intuition also tells me that a diffuse problem with no clear cause, where the proposed solutions involve giving world leaders the ability to micro-manage people, centralize control, act as a gateway for winners and losers, and extract wealth from the population at large without the need to contribute anything, creates a huge perverse incentive that we would do right to be extremely wary of, and further increased the likelihood that junk science, propaganda, and political theater will ensue.


TL;DR - If this is as big a problem as claimed, there would be no problem deriving clear, easy to explain facts that show it to be undeniable, and the people charged with finding out would make it their top priority to do so."

Speculation and warnings of catastrophic climate change are not unprecedented. In 2001 the Guardian noted that some '70's headlines shouted, ""Brace Yourself for Another Ice Age"". In 1971 the journal Science reported on the subsequent cooling effect resulting from a possible eightfold increase from atmospheric aerosol concentrations, ""if sustained over a period of several years‚Äîis believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.""

According to 80 graphs published in 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers in the first five months of 2017 alone, catastrophic anthropogenic global warming does not exist. By October 2017, the number of peer-reviewed papers rejecting global warming had increased to 400.

Over 31,000 American scientists have signed the petition rejecting global warming.

Even the ""97% of scientists agree on climate change"" is a blatant lie.¬† It's actually less than a third. Here is one example: ‚ÄúNinety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.‚Äù United States President Barack Obama tweeted that in 2013.

That ""97 percent scientific consensus‚Äù Mr. Obama referenced is not a fact. It is a terribly misleading figure. It derives from a survey of peer-reviewed science papers conducted by John Cook, an assistant professor at George Mason University. But only 34 percent of the papers Cook examined took a position on the cause of global warming. He reckoned that 33 percent (97 percent of 34 percent) blamed humans as a cause. By that reckoning, it would be more accurate to claim that one third of scientists say humans are causing climate change, and two thirds of them are not taking a position.

However, when University of Delaware Prof. David Legates reexamined Cook‚Äôs study, he found that even the 33 percent figure may be inflated. By his assessment, only about 0.3 percent of the abstracts Cook examined dogmatically state that humans cause climate change.

In the peer-reviewed Organization Studies, a 2012 survey of 1,077 professional engineers and geoscientists (or earth scientists) showed that 36 percent believed humans are creating a global warming crisis. The large remaining majority, however, were skeptical of this claim. They said they believe changes to the climate are natural, normal Earth cycles (global warming is what brought the world out of the Ice Age, for example)‚Äîor that future global warming will not cause a very serious problem.

So, somewhere between 0.3 percent and 36 percent of climate scientist believe that climate change is definitely caused by humans. That is hardly a ‚Äúscientific consensus.""

"Some Guy","2020-03-11T18:04:30Z","@Austin I am trying to promote thought, not saying that you havent looked into it before.  You seem very nice.  When I am at work I try to promote logical thinking by presenting steps then asking for interpretation.

I have a structural engineering degree and work in canada.  I have been up north some and consulted on projects are far north as Alert.  This is just me giving some background not telling you to believe me blindly.  Sadly the people that proclaim themselves  ""climate experts"" have no science background at all.  Here is the discussion I would propose...

How much ice is on the antarctic land mass?  And how many depressions are on the land mass that would form inland seas?

The liberals make it sound like this ice has been there forever and that it is somehow a sign of something terrible if it melts.  Do you know what we found in areas where the northern permafrost has melted?  Lichens and other biomass.  That means that in the past this ground was not frozen and it wasn't under water either.  These areas are very nearly at current sea level.

Where does the water go when the ice melts?  It evaporates out of the ocean.  It is carried over land.  It rains over land as fresh water.  The water seaps into the water table.  It then collects in streams.  Then lakes and rivers.  Then ends up in the oceans again.  The amount of water stored in the water table and aquifers is tremendous.  The amount of surface water depletion is currently a concern around here.  Nearby lakes are down 2 or 3 metres over the last 20 to 30 years (mostly due to man made diversions).  So any greater water introduced would have a location to go that would benefit all people.  When you see a lake with lower level than normal then that means the water table in the entire area around the lake is also lower.

Could melting ice raise the oceans?  Yes.  But the alarmists think that every drop would splash into the ocean.  They dont consider where it would redistribute.  These are the same people that 20 years ago said that if the ice melted this much California would be under water and half of the eastern seaboard would be flooded out.  The ice melted and the water did raise... a tiny fraction of what they were saying.  They never did update their predictions to include the new sea levels and ice that has already melted.  They still keep saying the water will raise this many feet.  If anything they have increased the number to make it scarier.  

Most ""activists"" are doing it to gain followers and ""likes"".  This generates more donations.  The more scared they make people the more they feel they need to do something... so they donate more and ""like"" more.  Its a circle.  

How many times has any climate activist actually reduced their approximation even one side of the doom?  If they have never said anything positive that is usually a sign thay they shouldnt be listened to.  If they cannot at least say that increased rainfall would help crops grow.  Or that their sea level rising estimate has been revised to be slightly lower."

Don‚Äôt believe the hype you get on TV

In Florida we expect the sun to shine brightly as we are closer to the equator than you are (i am guessing by your response)

We have plenty of rain and sunshine, crops do not fail even in hurricane season... the plants down here are suited to our weather.

If the sea level anywhere rises we here in Florida at sea level will see it first... it is essentially a 500 mile long sand bar so no flooding either.

Coming out of the last Glaciation from 15,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago, 

EARTH WARMED 5C in that 5000 years... that is a century rate of 0.1 C / 100 years.... (Earth Temps PEAKED around 8,000 years ago...from then on temps had been naturally falling per Earth Milankovitch Cycles...until this abnormal period of warming)

0.1C per century. ------> That is Earth Normal.

From 1880 to 1980, the measured rate of warming was 0.85C/100 yrs.

THAT is 8 TIMES FASTER than Earth normal.

Noted Denier/Skeptic Dr. John Christy had to admit 
after recalculating all sat. data with data from over 40,000 digital Earth Stations...
Earth has been warming 0.14 C Each Decade from 11/1978 thru this day.
That is a Century Rate of 1.4 C per century......
WE ARE NOW WARMING 14 times faster than Earth Norm."

As a result in much countries civil liberties are dictatorial curtailed, energy prices going up, traveling empeded and an increase in restrictions and obligations is omnipresent.

A city of 5 million people was covered in thick smoke for weeks, imposing huge burdens on healthcare and hundreds of millions in lost man hours. The fires started in winter and are expected to burn through to next winter, if the rains come. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the country severe storms have caused flooding and have washed the ash and other debris from previously fire-affected areas into dams and streams killing fish and making the water unusable. If that weren‚Äôt enough sustained heatwaves have pushed temperatures into the mid 40C (115F)  in our large cities causing deaths from heat exhaustion in humans and animals. All this was predicted in 2008 in a report to government by Ross Garnaut, an economist, charged with the responsibility of looking at the economic risks climate change might pose to the nation. And so it came to pass, lost revenue from industry, tourism; small businesses wiped out; reconstruction costs to government and insurance companies resulting in either skyrocketing premiums or refusal to insure; strain on the healthcare system (the current corona virus epidemic is just adding to that burden); tainted water, disruption to transportation as roads, bridges and other transport infrastructure has to be rebuilt. The cost to our nation from inaction on climate change as been in the billions so far and shows no signs of abating. It makes no economic sense to prop up one industry at the expense of every other. Climate change deniers have no moral high ground here, the costs of doing nothing are horrendous and this is only the beginning."

1) There is evidence showing that there has been a gradual increase in the earth‚Äôs temperature over time even before the industrial revolution in 1760 to 1840 on studies of ice core samples in Greenland.
2) The polar ice cap of Mars is melting too indicating an increase in temperature there as well.
 3) Pluto's temperature is also warming up considering that it is the farthest planet in the solar system.

Therefore, could it be possible that this is a solar-system wide event & cannot just be blamed on the greenhouse effect.

If we focus our energy in the wrong direction, then we are treating the symptom & not the cause of the sickness of our planet earth.

Not only does he not include more than a trace amount of actual science in his video, but he cynically trots out a bunch of tropes and ""talking points"" that have been discredited most thoroughly by actually looking at the evidence instead of just screaming wildly about ""leftists"" (a vague, meaningless term associated with communism in the mindset of many older USA citizens, who lived through the hysterical age of McCarthyism). Let's take a look at a couple: 1) Al Gore: this man is a politician, not a scientist. Moreover, he is a MORON - in his films he got nearly everything wrong, and he's done more harm to the cause of REAL climate science than any the entire industrial-Republican complex. 2) ""Climategate"".  Anyone who actually read more than a few quote-mined sound bites as in ""hide the decline"", lol) from these emails, knows that nothing at all nefarious or dishonest was indicated by ANY of the thousands of mostly private emails stolen from climate researchers. The matter was investigated to death by dozens of organizations worldwide, and the shrill claims by cynical folks grasping at straws to try and discredit the science behind our current understanding of climate change, were shown conclusively to be utterly false - in most cases, deliberate lies or willful ignorance at best.  3) the 97% thing: what the surveys actually show (and yes, almost everybody gets this wrong, even those who should know better) is that 97%+ of scientists ACTIVELY RESEARCHING CLIMATE-RELATED MATTERS, are on board with the notion that a) incredibly rapid warming is indeed taking place (mostly since 1970) on a global scale, and b) human activity is directly or indirectly (as in deforestation) responsible for most of this rapid warming.  Now, if 97% of people in a given field are in agreement on something (in this case, the field of climate science), then it's difficult to say they are involved in a conspiracy. Scientists are a hard-nosed, skeptical bunch not given to herd mentality: the way science normally progresses is by proving other scientists to be wrong. 4) The ""science is all about money"" meme is total, absolute nonsense: scientists on the whole are very intelligent people. They could make FAR more money by going into the fields of business, industry or finance, than they could ever make by pursuing a career path in the sciences.  People choose science as their profession not for monetary gains (science is NOT a lucrative business, unless you are researching nuclear weapons or working for pharmaceutical or oil companies: Mr. Stossel puts up a newsclip showing an EPA representative asking for a billion dollars - this is PEANUTS when it comes to the USA government, which spends almost a TRILLION dollars on ""defense"" - related categories.  5) The part where he attacks the clean energy manufacturers for receiving government subsidies is colossally hypocritical: oil and gas companies receive IMMENSE subsidies and tax breaks from government: an estimated half a trillion dollars a year worldwide - many many times the amount of taxpayer's money that is spent for clean energy development and encouragement. I could go on and on - bottom line is that 97% of what he presents here (and elsewhere in his right-wing rantings) is pure bunk."

It had a bit of personal credibility as the US NE Region got 2 years of the worst blizzards on record, 1977-78.     I did see snowbank up to the power lines.   
    There was also the great Denver Blizzard of 1982-3 and I lived them both.    Pretty nasty and people really did die getting their mail or of CO poisoning heating their homes any way they could. A couple suffocated while stuck under an interstate underpass on I-70.    Yes both sucked but they went away again.    If you just took common sense steps everyone was ok in the end.     Yet when you read up on even recent Mid 19 Century blizzards they were nothing more than typical.    In the end of course we had nothing close to an ice age , pure nonsense. 
     Here‚Äôs another phony hoax though non weather related.      Back in the early 1990s we started selling large quantities of softwood overseas, mainly China I recall.    Lions n tigers n bears oh my the cry went up.     A big spike in hurricane damage and NAFTA happened as well.  We we‚Äôre going to run out of softwood lumber again by the early 2000s.     Oh and prices spiked on these things.  A 2x 4 cost around $3 locally , oh my.    Gee, and they are about that price 20 years later and the forests have done as they always did,ü§î. GREW BACK!     Of course in 2020 there‚Äôs no shortage whatsoever.   
     Theres been many other scares and shortages and they all have one thing in common.    It‚Äôs ü§•making hay for some industry , group or political aim.

Now, in relation to the point _I think_ you are trying to make, from the prehistorical records, the climate has been changing since before simians roamed the Earth... So, if by ""Climate Change"", you mean ""Man-made Climate Change"", yes, human beings have an effect on the climate, in the same way butterflies' wings do. It's really only a matter of scale.

You remember George Box's famous quip: ""All models are wrong... but some are useful""?

Hello dumbfuck soybois and soygurrls.....
if you really want to contribute urgently to the well being of this beautiful planet the best thing to do is remove your presence from the planet. It doesn't really matter how much fun you're currently having being alive you just have to get off the planet.
If this selflessness was actually practiced by the dumbfuck masses like you just think how much the planet would benefit. I don't understand what's holding up you guys from doing the right thing instead of preaching and screetching and naked street dancing. The more you hold up traffic the larger your 
carbon footprint. 
De existing is the¬† solution.
Go for it. Just do it. Be woke. 
Drink some more 
Woke O'Cola. ....Go woke..... 
Get out woke.
Even if humans had not evolved all this climate would still be changing like normal planetary changes. 
The problem is the climate change activists want everyone to live like mahatma Gandhi but they themselves don't want to. Like the co founder of that Extinction rebellion said herself it's not about her lifestyle changing it's about ours changing. Sure. 
It was a fantastic slip. 
Con people trying to mass move a false scare. You can't change the planet climate. Ask any Red Indian witchdoctor still dancingand prancing around a fire trying bullshit stuff to try and bullshit 
Big Chief Twodogsfuckingcasuallyinpublic.
And if water is onto your property you've not planned your dwelling right. Location is everything....for sometime. When the planet's automatic movements come to remind you of your errors you got to move. Weather and climate never stop or can ever be stopped or changed. Men , and women more so are prone to pipe dreams. Man is a migratory animal. 
If little Gretastupid can cross oceans why can't others ? 
Al Gone shouted lies and went....
Greta today is a front for the climate tax lobby and a great way to bunk school. Which child wouldn't say anything to get a holiday ? 
Climate change is one big con.
What we need is environment repair and that is happening naturally. 
Once the population goes down drastically humans will stabilise at one billion. Then according to real social scientists like James Lovelock the planet will be sustainable. 
The planet doesn't have a climate problem....the problem is human population and what to do with the excess baggage that is weighing humanity down like a stinky over filled diaper. There is a solution but its unthinkable because of political correctness. And that's our civilisation's downfall. 
As we speak.
The future is always unwritten. 
Scare mongering is a current fad....first Al Gone...now some sixteen year old child with the mental capacity of an eight year old .....next they might send a premie to the United Nations....and all the dumbfucks will again applaud.....appalling.
Rubbing shoulders in the age of atomic and automatic weapons is a natural way to keep the population down. Nature doesn't care for political correctness it seems.

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.

Period of Record
417,160 - 2,342 years BP

Methods
In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).

Trends
There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

Just take a example of green house ( it is facility to grow small plants in their seed stage) in greenhouse temp are hot hotter so plants grow better so u think its good that temp are hotter but in case earth its not all tropics the earth is filled with ice caps on the both side if temp increase they melt causing change in water current,desalination and increase in level of water the changes are not so drastic but over time more Strom's ,famin ,heat waves,colder winter etc will effect the earth plz do some reserch on topic u cover.

No the weather gets more extreme in both directions
Cold places get colder
Hot places get hotter

The problem isnt that the weather gets warmer but what that causes in the world

Sea levels rise and flood nations close to the water making a mass refuge of people from those places happen

We all know how bad the refuge crisis was handled but this would be even bigger

Millions of animal specieses would die because they cant adapt to the changes of nature

Millions of years old viruses trapped in ice would get set free agains wich our body hasnt developed any antibodys

""""I do receive some funding from the fossil fuel industry. My company...does hurricane forecasting...for an oil company, since 2007.

Fact: CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Fact: Adding this greenhouse effect to a background global warming accelerates the warming. Fact: The rate of climate change has never been this high in human history. Fact: Warming occurs faster in the high latitudes than it does in mid and low latitudes. Fact: Melting ice caps reduces albedo and increases the rate that solar energy is absorbed. Fact: The oceans are warming. Fact: Warming ocean waters changes the circulation pattern and raises sea level. Fact: Local warming creates storms. And so on. If you are OK with all that then continue with your philosophy of ""What, me worry?"". But please stop trying to get people to believe that the world's university climatic scientists are somehow in collusion so that they can make fortunes with their scare tactics. College athletic coaches make 4-5 times the salary and for what? Playing a game. I assure you John, this is not a game.

Migration crisis
Sea currents chance, altering the climate of many regions
Ocean acidification: killing marine life before they can adapt -> leading to hunger all over the world
Melting ice sheets releases methane that increase the green house effect and speed up the warming
Animals migrating to area more suitable from them which will undoubtedly lead to populated areas which will lead to the number of animal to decrease 
Potentially a release of dormant disease or a pathogen from the permafrost due to the melting

"Lawrence Seiji Abbott","2019-10-15T07:48:03Z","It's agreed though that the warming is human caused, as mentioned. This is mainly why it's believed to be a potential issue if human caused warming continues because it's not apart of the natural cycle that they kept bringing up in this video as warming being normally apart of, but human-induced warming isnt apart of the earth's natural flux. And if not global warming, look into ocean acidification which is an alarming issue for the shellfish that act as important components in the ocean's food web. It is true though that we don't know how more clouds from higher evaporation rates from higher temps will affect the planet, but so far we know that the changes are intensifying all weather phenomena. Dry seasons are getting longer and snow seasons are getting more intense but shorter in dessert climates, and even the jet stream is being affected, bringing colder winds from the poles to the northern US, intensifying their snow seasons with earlier onsets. So many factors, to the very least its important to stay aware of these phenomena and watch carefully. But yeah, it is too bad to see that the science is being overhyped when we gotta be more realistic and honest about the reliability of the projections. But it doesn't mean there's no environmental issues like farmers over use of fertilizers(eutrophication), deforestation, ocean acidification, plastic issues, pollution, etc.

The ozone issue was fixed by Jerry Rowland, UCIrvine's scientist, and it was his research that helped warn people, but wasnt until way later they finally did something about it. So we still cant just ignore the potential issues til its too late."

The sales tax if by what you mean as the consumer tax however if not sufficient enough to compensate for the mass population who are in need of financial assistance.

You automatically assume when I use the term ,"" taxation is theft,"" that I'm talking about every tax, cause it might be news to you that there's more than one kind. INCOME tax is theft, does that make you understand. The money I work for, that i earn should be left alone. The government has no business touching it.  
       Consumer tax by itself would be more than enough to take care of infrastructure and the departments that keep our society safe. But of course our government cant be responsible with the money they get through our taxes, so they tax us even more, and we all know that our politicians have to keep getting that six figure salary for all that hard work they do, lol. These overpaid politicians and bloated departments like the EPA is where the real thievery is happening. 
           If somone is struggling with even two jobs, maybe they should consider looking for a better paying job, live within their means, relocate to a more affordable area, or get a trade.

Some people even work two jobs, but can't make ends meet or provide for their families because their income does not support a fair living. 

You rant about taxation being theft, yet you understand NOTHING. I think the phrase you are looking for, coined in the 1700's, is ""no taxation without representation."" Guess what dumbass, taxation is represented. As in for the best interests of the people, decided by the people, for the people! And through political processes that you've inherently agreed to by being a fucking citizen. What happens to that precious infrastructure we all depend on without them? Who's gonna pay for it?? The private sector who's sole concern is PROFITS?!? How about that free water, public safety, public transportation, FDA regulations to ensure safe food, drugs, medical devices, etc... That national security sure is nice. I guess we don't really need Fire or Police department agencies. The list goes on. Maybe think before you speak next time dip shit. Normally I don't revert to such hostile arguments, but you pushed first and I can't stand this simple-minded, tired, or rather expired argument. For the record, if anyone is robbing you, it's the tech giants, fossil fuel industry, big pharma, and other industries lobbying political interests that pay virtually ZERO in taxes. That's where the money is being funneled OUT, and there is your theft."
"Megatron who's always High on them feels","2019-10-04T03:51:47Z","@Stan Shumer yes, unfortunately, we do have socialist programs already here but if people were allowed to keep the money they earned, there wouldn't be a need for these programs to make up for capitalism's ""short comings"" as you put it. Taxation is theft, in other words, you want something, get off your ass and work for it like the rest of us. Don't expect me to pay for it!
  
 All these bullshit, green policies are nothing but a joke and have nothing to do with helping the environment. They'll cost trillions to incorporate and in turn will hike taxes sky high.

TRUMP set up a charitable Foundation which was illegal
Hillary Victory Fund Was never  a CHARITY!
It was a Campaign Fund.
""PHILADELPHIA ‚Äî Leaked emails show the Democratic National Committee scrambled this spring to conceal the details of a joint fundraising arrangement with Hillary Clinton that funneled money through state Democratic parties.

But during the three-month period when the DNC was working to spin the situation, state parties kept less than one half of one percent of the $82 million raised through the arrangement ‚Äî validating concerns raised by campaign finance watchdogs, state party allies and Bernie Sanders supporters.

The arrangement, called the Hillary Victory Fund, allowed the Clinton campaign to seek contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend extravagant fundraisers including a dinner at George Clooney‚Äôs house and a concert at Radio City Music Hall featuring Katy Perry and Elton John. That‚Äôs resulted in criticism for Clinton, who has made opposition to big money in politics a key plank in her campaign platform.

Clinton‚Äôs allies have responded publicly by arguing that the fund is raising big money to boost down-ballot Democratic candidates by helping the 40 state parties that are now participating in the fund."

"mypresident Trump","2019-09-18T13:30:20Z","The earths orbit controls its climate


Astronomer Milutin Milankovitch discovered this in the 1920s it is referred to as the Milankovitch cycles. 


This is the climate science you've never heard because the Earth's orbit cannot be guilt tripped into financial donations or votes. 


The Milankovitch cycles show that the earth is on 100,000 year elliptical orbit around the sun at the coldest part we are 94.5 million miles from the sun at witch point we have glacier maximums 20 consecutive times this means northern hemisphere has been covered in glaciers down to Minneapolis, Chicago, New York and Moscow covered in ice for thousands years.


At 91.4 million miles the closest point in earth elliptical orbit we glacier minimum which means the northern hemisphere is glacier free this is happened 20 times in the last 2 million years. This means the north pole is open water year-round, green land if free of ice and ocean levels are much higher.


Man-made CO2 had nothing to do with the 20 previous glacier maximums and glacier minimums therefore it has nothing to do with the end of 21st glacier maximum which started 17,000 to 20,000 years ago that's when the glacier started to melt and the ocean started to rise.


This mind blowing scientific fact that the glacier started melting 17,000 years before Henry Ford came out with the model T the first mass-produced internal combustion engine means that the internal combustion engine is not melting the glaciers.


The Internal combustion engine does not drive climate change because we are in a climate cycle.


Milankovitch cycles also states the earth tilt or wobble which is what gives us winter, spring, summer and fall is on a 41,000 year cycle. That changes from 22.1 to 24.5. Our current title is 23.5 this is important because the wobble is a major factor in Earth's climate and is not being discussed in today's climate debate.


When I see politicians acting like witch doctors predicting the weather and threatening people for money and votes, when they can't even explain the Earth's climate history but are certain they can predict its future. I want to see Al Gore and AOC paint their face and dance around the fire and tell me they can make it rain or stop raining, Why can't we just sacrifice a goat and get on with using CO2.


CO2 is not a poison it's what plants breathe in, in exchange for oxygen and food. The elimination of CO2 would eliminate plant life causing all humans and mammals to suffocate from lack of oxygen and starvation from lack of food. The green new deal is a path to a Dead planet.


Inconvenient fact about CO2 human production of CO2 has increase crop yields by 40% over the last 150 years.


Little history on CO2, 600,000 years ago when the dinosaurs roamed the planet we had 12 times the amount of CO2 in the air, the earth climate was 13¬∞ warmer and the earth was perfectly fine, there were palm trees in the Arctic Circle and lizards had enough food to grow to the size of T Rex. I'm pretty confident that the human species can adapt to the climate dinosaurs thrived it.


If the earths orbit controls its climate and man-made CO2 is not a poison but a blessing, then why do democratic and the democratic media focus on climate change, well the fundraising guilt trip is a factor.


When you look at AOC‚Äôs green new deal and its goal of zero CO2 emissions by 2030 you have to wonder does she not realize this is a fund raising scam to make money from the oil and utility industries or wait maybe the threat of putting them out of business in 10 years is the biggest fund raising scheme the Democrats have ever had.


Ask yourself how much would Exxon, BP and the entire Oil, Gas and Coal Industry donate to AOC and the Democrats too not be put out of business?


To the people of Iowa and farmers all across America, zero admissions means zero gasoline and diesel which also means zero ethanol subsidy. If you think the Trump trade war with china is bad for farm country try losing the ethanol subsidy.


Also to America's farmers without Diesel your tractors are useless are the Democrats promising   to give it every farmer an electric tractor that doesn't currently exist to replace the diesel tractor that won't work in 10 years?


I call upon President Trump, Congress and the Secretary of Education to made Milankovitch cycles part of America's educational system K-12 and it America's official climate position.


I'm producing a documentary film about all the earth orbit controls its climate you can find out more at orbitdener.com and mypresidenttrump.us ¬©

Look at Germany's economic woes over energy and compare it to US with fracking, shale which helped lower our emissions.


Destroying the economy of the US, Europe for a theory that hasn't manifested after many failed predictions is not ""better safe than sorry"" Scientists can't even simulate precipitation, clouds in their models--how can they say their projections are correct? They most certainly won't be as rain cools the earth's surface, clouds help control temperature and different cloud formations have different properties, some allowing more radiation back into space. All this while Antarctic ice is increasing after Gore claimed the poles could be gone by 2014. 


Climate Gate emails, disputes over Medieval Warm Period, the disparity between claims of global cooling in the late 70s vs global warming more recently, credible accusations of data alteration by NOAA, NASA, silencing of dissent and the fact that we have much fewer hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, droughts, famines now than compared to early in the 20th century all point to climate paranoia being just that.

Did you know that the earths atmosphere currently only contains 400 Parts Per Million (PPM) of CO2 and 97% of the 400PPM is created by nature and only 3% is created by humans. So let‚Äôs put this into dollars and cents,,, if you took 1,000,000 dollars only $400 would be CO2 and out of that $400 nature produces $388 and $12 is made by man.  That is a very small amount. Greenhouses purchase CO2 generators to increase the CO2 from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm which is the optimum level for plant growth.  So stop and think,,if CO2 was such a problem why do greenhouses increase the CO2 to get better vegetation growth.  In fact if the CO2 level dropped to 170 to 150 ppm then all vegetation dies off and so do we!!!   More and more extremely knowledgable scientists are coming forward and showing the FACTS that climate change is a hoax. Any warming is currently being caused by the sun, the moon and the earth alignment and it has nothing to do with CO2.

NYC Conservative Climate Activists:
https://www.meetup.com/nyccca/

Partial group summary:
'We are a pro-human, pro-technology, market-friendly environmental group.

Visit our website: http://nyc-cca.com/

The purpose of this meetup group is to investigate the science, engineering, and economics of climate change and its solutions.

There will be *NO* talk of polar bears, whales, or baby seals.

We take what Al Gore says with a grain of salt. He's a politician with a law degree, not a scientist.

We will devote considerable time to the debate over whether climate change is even happening, and whether it will be enough of a problem to justify action. Climate skeptics are very welcome to attend, but they should be aware that people who just come to disrupt, or who are rude, or shout and interrupt a lot, will not be tolerated.'"
"Dan Africk","2019-08-27T17:22:10Z","The problem is that the leftist media, politicians, and academics lie about so much, so constantly, and are so incredibly biased without even realizing it, the people who aren't on the left don't trust them when they talk about climate change. I can understand why. 

But climate change is real. There is overwhelming evidence that temperatures are rising and ice is melting. The sea level WILL rise, extreme weather events will continue to get worse and more frequent, ecosystems will change and more species will go extinct. This is inevitable at this point, and this is already causing sever problems, but we can still have an impact on how bad it will get.

If you're skeptical, think about this: Even if this is all not true, and climate change is one massive hoax or conspiracy or just an enormous blunder, consider this. Fossil fuel is a finite resource, which WILL run out. You may disagree with exactly when, but we use a shitload of it, have already mined an enormous amount of it, and it's inevitable that it will run out before too long. We need more sustainable sources of energy, fuel, plastics, etc. Even if climate change is all a hoax, converting to solar, wind, etc is good for everyone in the long run. It's also good for national security, and arguably good for the economy when you think about all the jobs (many of which cannot be outsourced) it will create. 

Also anyone who's sane must realize it's possible that they're wrong. Think about what it would mean if you're wrong. If I'm wrong about climate change being real and a problem, and we take urgent steps to rapidly transition to sustainable energy sources and carbon capture, and implement things like a carbon tax and/or cap & trade, the results still look pretty good to me: sustainable energy, cleaner environment, lots of new industry and jobs. Maybe more birds killed by wind turbines that some people find ugly.. 
What if I'm right and you're wrong, and even the mildest predictions of thousands of climate scientists is right? I think the outcome of that scenario is a bit more bleak... 

Please don't let your understandable contempt for the left lead you to automatically dismiss what scientists are telling us and erase all your humility and reason.. The message can be real even if the messenger is an ass.. To assume that you can't possibly be wrong when the stakes are this high, is reckless, short-sighted, and petty."

According to Deke Arndt, head of climate monitoring for NOAA, July 2019 marked the 415th straight month that was warmer than the 20th century average.

In keeping with accelerating global warming, nine of the 10 warmest Julys have occurred since 2005, NOAA found.

July brought extreme heat to Europe, and massive wildfires to the Arctic, including Alaska, Siberia and even Greenland, as well as a record and sudden melt event to the Greenland Ice Sheet."

Near epidemics of Skin Cancers around the world were examined by Main Steam Science, Laboratory experiments, Scientific Technology, Peer Review, Publication, Replication.  Ozone is a highly atmospheric Gas reactive molecule that contains three oxygen atoms. It is constantly being formed & broken down in the high atmosphere, 6.2 to 31 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) above Earth, in the region called the stratosphere.
.
The Ozone layer 
has deteriorated due to the release of industrial pollution containing the chemicals chlorine and bromine. Centuries of Massive Human Industry DUMPING TOXIC Gasses & Chemicals into our atmosphere. Such deterioration allows large amounts of ultraviolet B rays to reach Earth, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm animals as well.

World's top climate scientists told to 'cover up' the fact t azqhat the Earth's temperature hasn't risen for the last 15 years
By Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent

Scientists working on the most authoritative study on climate change were urged to cover up the fact that the world‚Äôs temperature hasn‚Äôt risen for the last 15 years, it is claimed.

Scientists working on the most authoritative study on climate change were urged to cover up the fact that the world‚Äôs temperature hasn‚Äôt risen for the last 15 years, it is claimed.
A leaked copy of a United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States raised concerns about the final draft.
Published next week, it is expected to address the fact that 1998 was the hottest year on record and world temperatures have not yet exceeded it, which scientists have so far struggled to explain.
The report is the result of six years‚Äô work by UN‚Äôs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is seen as the world authority on the extent of climate change and what is causing it ‚Äì on which governments including Britain‚Äôs base their green policies.
Concerns: Scientists have been urged to cover up the fact that the Earth's temperature hasn't risen for the last 15 years amid fears it would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change
But leaked documents seen by the Associated Press, yesterday revealed deep concerns among politicians about a lack of global warming over the past few years.
Germany called for the references to the slowdown in warming to be deleted, saying looking at a time span of just 10 or 15 years was ‚Äòmisleading‚Äô and they should focus on decades or centuries. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has changed its tune after issuing stern warnings about climate change for years
Hungary worried the report would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change.
Belgium objected to using 1998 as a starting year for statistics, as it was exceptionally warm and makes the graph look flat - and suggested using 1999 or 2000 instead to give a more upward-pointing curve.
World's top climate scientists confess: Global warming is just QUARTER what we thought - and computers got the effects of greenhouse gases wrong

Global warming will end life on earth (but don't panic, you've got 3.5bn years left!)

The United States delegation even weighed in, urging the authors of the report to explain away the lack of warming using the ‚Äòleading hypothesis‚Äô among scientists that the lower warming is down to more heat being absorbed by the ocean ‚Äì which has got hotter.
The last IPCC ‚Äòassessment report‚Äô was published in 2007 and has been the subject of huge controversy after it had to correct the embarrassing claim that the Himalayas would melt by 2035.
It was then engulfed in the ‚ÄòClimategate‚Äô scandal surrounding leaked emails allegedly showing scientists involved in it trying to manipulate their data to make it look more convincing ‚Äì although several inquiries found no wrongdoing.
The latest report, which runs to 2,000 pages, will be shown to representatives from all 195 governments next week at a meeting in Stockholm, who can discuss alterations they want to make.

But since it was issued to governments in June, they have raised hundreds of objections about the 20-page summary for policymakers, which sums up the findings of the scientists.
What it says will inform renewable energy policies and how much consumers and businesses will pay for them.
The report is expected to say the rate of warming between 1998 and 2012 was about half of the average rate since 1951 ‚Äì and put this down to natural variations such as the El Nino and La Nina ocean cycles and the cooling effects of volcanoes.
A leaked copy of the United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States have raised concerns about the final draft. Above, the United Nations headquarters building in New York
A German climate scientist - Stefan Rahmstorf, who reviewed the chapter on sea levels - yesterday admitted it was possible the report‚Äôs authors were feeling under pressure to address the slowdown in warming due to the ‚Äòpublic debate‚Äô around the issue.
The draft report, which is not new research but a synthesis of all the work being done by scientists around the world, is likely to be highly disputed at the three-day meeting.
It will make the case that humans are causing global warming with carbon emissions even more strongly upgrading it from ‚Äòvery likely‚Äô in 2007 to ‚Äòextremely likely‚Äô it is manmade.
But scientists are under pressure to explain why the warming has not exceeded 1998 levels although the decade 2000-2010 was the hottest on record.
Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists based in Washington, said yesterday: ‚ÄòI think to not address it would be a problem because then you basically have the denialists saying: ‚ÄòLook the IPCC is silent on this issue.‚Äô
Jonathan Lynn, a spokesman for the IPCC said yesterday: ‚ÄòThis is the culmination of four years‚Äô work by hundreds of scientists, where governments get a chance to ensure the summary for policymakers is clear and concise in a dialogue with the scientists who wrote it, and have the opportunity to raise any topics they think should be highlighted.‚Äô

Bastardi specializes in understanding the history of weather and climate and said he used this understanding to accurately predict both Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Arthur ahead of official warnings. In contrast, he said ¬†alarmists ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what happened yesterday‚Äù or ‚Äúknow anything about what happened in the past.‚Äù
As Bastardi pointed out, he has to make accurate predictions in order to be paid and has no political motivation.
Bastardi asserted that alarmist¬†scientists cannot actually be objective, because they are given grants explicitly to study global warming. He called upon alarmists to answer just one question. ‚ÄúWhat would it take for you to change? What do you need to see?‚Äù If this question cannot be answered, he argued, then there is nothing empirical behind their arguments that man is causing catastrophic climate change.
Addressing the science, Bastardi noted the entire world only adds 1.8 ppm of CO2 in a year, he called the notion that this miniscule amount causes extreme weather ‚Äúludicrous.‚Äù Instead, he said alarmists are just ‚Äútaking every weather event they can find‚Äù and connecting it to climate change. He urged people to ask themselves if they believe that amount of carbon dioxide could have the impact that climate alarmists claim it does.
He also criticized the so-called consensus of alarm among climate scientists, saying ‚Äúit is easy to have consensus when someone will pay you to have one.‚Äù Bastardi was very firm in the belief that the climate movement was ‚Äúnot about science‚Äù but had become a movement ‚Äúfrom people who make profits‚Äù off the hysteria.
In his view, the alarmists‚Äô goal was the ‚Äúrestructuring of the way our society works,‚Äù and the consequences if their economic recommendations are adopted are ‚Äúsuicide for our way of life.‚Äù Furthermore, he pointed out that the United States alone cannot make an impact on global emissions, as it releases only 10 percent of the world‚Äôs carbon dioxide. He joked ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do? Go to war with the rest of the globe [and force them to cut emissions]?‚Äù

"dave phillips","2019-07-23T02:29:07Z","The more you know about what is actually happening to our world, the more worried you will be. Most people don't even understand the difference between climate and weather. Yes it is true that climate change is a natural ongoing process. It is also true that the level of C02 in the atmosphere continues to rise and we now know what effects that will have on climate and weather. The increase in greenhouse gasses (not just CO2) is facilitating an unprecedented change in the rate of climate change. Weather can vary, but a warmer world will have more extreme weather events and more intense weather. We can see this happening. Storms are becoming bigger and more intense. Dry areas are becoming drier. Wet areas wetter. The arctic and the antarctic are warming fastest of all that affects temperature gradients worldwide that power air and ocean currents. Did you know the Jetstream is weakening? So is the Gulfstream. If this trend continues, the effect on weather will be drastic.

The temperature increase of 1¬∞-2¬∞ may seem harmless but that's just the average, in places like the arctic and the antarctic that number is closer to 3-4 degrees which causes the ice to melt which can mess with the ocean currents by affecting the salinity of the water, as well as possibly drive the species living there to extinction.
Ice also reflects sunlight which would warm the ocean even more if that ice melted which would  cause the ocean to get warmer and melt more ice and so on
not to mention the amount of naturall disasters (hurricanes, floods) have increased massively"

This place pumped out so much poison daily, the townspeople were told not to exercise outside and avoid taking deep breaths. The trees were devoid of leaves, the lakes had fish with 3 eyeballs and hands instead of fins, some 95% of pregnancies resulted in miscarriages, and when they interviewed the towns people, they said in broken English, ""What we going to do, company gives us jobs"".

3) say ""water vapor is a vastly more important green house gas, and it's wider infrared absorption bands already cover CO2's narrow bands.(*)
4) The earth is 15% greener now than when satellites first started taking pictures.  (**)
5) What ever science there once was has been hijacked by socialists.
6) Grand Solar Minimum.
7) We've had ice ages with 4,500 ppm CO2, and warm periods with 200 ppm CO2; clearly CO2 is not the control knob on the earth's temperature.
8) Termites emit way more methane than cows.
9) Why have the ice caps on Mars melted?
10) Al Gore bought seaside property; he ain't worried.


(*) Al Gore said in his movie, ""If you ignore the effect of water vapor, CO2 is the most powerful greenhouse gas.""  This is like saying, ""If you ignore that man with the machine gun, the guy with the pocket knife is the most dangerous man in the room.""


(**) and follow this up with the reason: plants lose water to gain CO2.  The 100 ppm increase has made it so that instead of losing 100 water molecules for every CO2 the plant captures, it now only loses 84.  The greening has turned up around the margins of deserts, and has nothing to do with humans planting anything."

1 CO2 causes global warming 
2. Humans create CO2 which is a poison not used by trees to live
3. We have a switch
4. China and India and creating 1500 new power stations in the next five years increasing CO2 probably 100% 
5. This will increase temps 100% 
6. Polar ice caps will melt causing 4m sea level increase in the next 12 years

Surprised i remembered all your theories.
Any im wrong on just tell me.
So this will he easy right.
You are using M Mann hockey stick
I can see it already.
So lets revisit sea levels every year next five to ten years. And temps of course. Then we see whos theory is closest to reality. 
My prediction.
1. Weather is cyclical 
2. Earth getting greener
3. Temps wont change number of all time max and min temos reached will average - zero - proxy will be USA state record temps 50 states  Europe countries records 55 states and Australian states and territories seven as our proxy. In case you need to check 
One new record high and one new record low would be zero change. And visa versa 

4. Sea levels wont rise ( Sydney amd NYC tide giages as our proxies)

Next year we return to discuss our findings like scientists concerned for the future - whoever wins can tell everyone and I personally will happily concede there is global warming if your right. 

I presume your sea level is linear so 10 yesrs is 40cm though where it has some compounding tendancies we can simply half the reading so 20cm by next year. 

Temps for you doubling in 5 years will be ok but we will need to make it linear :)"

"jesterd14","2019-07-13T23:54:51Z","Just look at the research done by the Office of the Naval Oceanographer for an unbiased report.  The Navy has been measuring the thickness of the Arctic and Antarctic Ice for well over 50 years.  The reason is nuclear submarines operate under the polar caps, and they have to know if they can surface in case of an emergency. Submarines use SONAR to measure the thickness and report it along with their exact position and a constantly changing ice map is produced. ¬†Unless you think that DoD and the Pentagon are biased.  

Also, we are having a hurricane in mid-July, which is rare because usually the sea water is not warm enough and there is not enough moisture. ""June too soon, July too dry"" But as of today 07/13/19, the Mississippi River has been above flood stage for 10 days.

There is other science that disputes this claim saying the models are incorrect because of actual data. There definitely is a warming trend but it‚Äôs not totally abnormal for earth to do this kind of thing and we may not be the biggest factor causing it.

And thus I don't have an agenda or a bias based on what result some funding body would like me to support nor which peer reviewed papers get accepted and published. 
What I am capable of doing is reading Abstracts and making an informed judgement on data and then assess models that reveal changing patterns. I don't have a bias to cherry pick models that claim to support CO2 culpable climate change and reject others. I dont agree that Correlation proves causation. E.g. We hear from WFS that deforestation has resulted in removal of 40% of the world's natural CO2 scavenger. Without photosynthesis (CO2, water and heat) as the¬† natural driver of the carbon cycle, we would be a desolate lifeless wasteland!! 
Why doesn't the alarmist want to discuss volcanism, sunspot activity wild fires, deforestation, logging and the urban sprawl? Which I'm told contributes 8x the amount of atmospheric CO2 as fossil fuel. Conclusion: the only evidence I can discover about CO2 effecting life is that a rise of 300ppm would¬† produce crop yields like grain and rice that are between 30 and 250% greater."

2--the ""97% agree!!!"" has been a known lie for 10 years or so.  Yet...we keep hearing it because it's all they've got.
There were 14,944 climate papers by 29,083 authors.  A biased group called ""Rebutting Global Warming Misinformation"" cherry picked...chose 8,547 authors....asked them to sign their protest.  1,189 signed (4% of the 29,083)....and 97% agreed.  So in truth....it's 97% of the 4% who agree....agree.

Those 4+ centuries of below normal temps and expanding glaciers and sea ice caused the deaths of more than 65 million people; but you never hear a peep about that from the Warmist Scientists...EVER!. 

Added to that little perspective enhancer is the fact that the vast majority of Warmist Scientists on the government payroll - in one way or another - have tweaked, tinkered re-located and re-calibrated their newest instrumentation in such way as to reflect their dogma and not reality. If you recall, the fact that they were doing that was revealed in the ""Climate-Gate"" emails, back in 2009. Do you think they have changed their strategy and manipulations in the ensuing years? Refined and better concealed their methods perhaps. But reformed? Not a chance.

"ecbravo999","2019-06-28T13:11:22Z","All climate cycles on any planet are driven by the sun not people. Greenland was called Greenland because there was no ice and it was lush and green with vegetation brought about by much higher CO2 levels than today. Earths glacial and inter glacial climate cycles have occurred long before man came along. If CO2 was driving climate cycles then why do all ice core records show that temperature changes always lead CO2 changes by 400-600 years? The cause and effect relationship is backwards which proves that atmospheric CO2 has nothing to do with climate change. It is however plant food. Ice cores show that CO2 concentrations have been much higher than today averaging around 2000 ppm with vast increases in plant growth and diversity of species. All before man had fire. If the sun heats the planet and the climate varies there is nothing man can do about it except to do as all species have done ADAPT.

"James Hennighan","2019-06-26T16:35:31Z","The IPCC is not a scientific body, it is a political one..............although you could be forgiven for not knowing this, because it is always put forth as a scientific body.

In reality it is an arm of the UN designed to apply more and more taxes to developed countries and their industries in order to then spread this money around the world on behalf of the UN........be it to third world countries, dictators or oppressive regimes......

It is readily fawned over by politicians and bureaucrats because they are all signed up to promoting it at all costs...........

It's a gravy train where individual politicians and governments virtue-signal to us all.

Everything about it shrieks ' public subsidy'....... or........' more money please'..........

Currently here in the UK our politicians are engaged in promoting our leadership in this field.........whilst disadvantaging ourselves....

"Bob John","2019-06-25T06:44:24Z","The 2 degree target is now unattainable (unless of course the entirety of civilization does a 180 today...) and is based on geoengineering the climate of the earth as well as the sequestering of every molecule of carbon we have produced since 1987, as well as every molecule we are producing today, as well as every molecule we produce tomorrow.... with magical technologies that don't exist, won't exist and, even if they did would likely cause as many if not more problems than they fix.

But it is worse than that.

The 2-degree target of the IPCC does not factor in the feedback loops such as the increased absorption of heat due to a drastic reduction in the albedo (reflectivity) effect caused by the 70% loss of Arctic ice,..- the release of methane from the thawing Arctic. (there is more energy stored in the arctic methane than there is in coal in the world). This is called the methane dragon. If the process of the release of the methane, currently frozen in the soil and ocean beds of the Arctic, which may have already begun, but if it spins out of control we are looking an 8-degree rise in temperature.

But it is worse than that.

The report which gives us 12 years to get our head's out of our arses underestimated the amount of heat stored in the world's oceans, as we discovered in mid-January by 40%... so no, we don't have 12 more years. And the contention that this destructive anthropogenic effect on climate is either new or natural is incorrect. A recent study of tree ring size the world over has found synchronized global droughts since about the year 1900. A phenomenon which did not exist in the 1000 previous years."

For starters, the very article that you linked states that there is some disagreement about wether the hottest temperature was accurately recorded, and that the actual hottest day may have taken place in 2013. Of course, none of this matters at all because one hot day does not disprove climate change. On average, the Earth is hotter than it was 100 years ago.

They are literally achieving nothing at all and they should be stopped. We've already tasted how they ramped up inflation with money printing and energy cost hikes and poor geopolitical planning (Europe). 

Here's a piece of evidence on why the agenda is only manipulating money supply, increases red tape costs without any tangible benefits (by their own criteria). 

In 2000 the fossil fuels mix in global energy was about 86% and after 22 years (2022) of regulations, cap and trade schemes, trillions of $s in subsidies, fines, emission-related vehicle registration costs, taxes on fossil fuels, etc, etc, the global energy mix is now at 84% fossil fuels and with today's 84% being greater (in globally consumed volumes of fossil fuels)  than the 86% of 2000 since overall global energy demand is much higher than back then. 

So, the ""climate change"" (why did they changed the name? Scientists don't make name changed and definitions easily!) agenda is not doing anything by its own dubious criteria."

It's okay, because Michael Mann's graph does away with these, as well as the little ice age and the mid evil warm period.

Nothing suspicious about the satellite data; we should believe that rather than hundreds of sites here on earth still taking measurements, still saying nothing is different here on earth.  We should believe people paid billions of dollars to prove global warming and sea level rise.  We should believe Obama when he says ""Global warming is serious; we need to pass laws and increase taxes."" and then he buys a seaside mansion.

Well, yes; the temperature is going up.  And CO2 is going up.  It doesn't mean they have anything to do with each other.  It's correlation, not causation.  
The only way to cool the earth is to install a Planetary Air Conditioner.  I've done that.  Figured out how much heat ""global warming"" um,  ""Climate Change"" um, ""CLIMATE EMERGENCY!""  yeah; that's the ticket!  ratchet up the rhetoric to fan up the fear!  I figured out how much heat has been added, divided that by 7 billion people, and that's my fair share.  For a one time charge of $100 I added enough cold to the environment to offset the heat of ten people.  I did it five years ago, it's still working, and it still draws zero power from the electric company.  And the US government is trying to pass a ""Carbon Neutral Tax"" that will add $1,300 per person in taxes per year, every year.  (*)
Global warming was a scam.  It was the same nonsense as the Nigerian ""You'll get a million dollars for helping me, but you need to send me $200 first.""  It's still a scam under it's new names.

(*) The Carbon Neutral Tax (called Neutral because it is revenue neutral to the government) pulls $440 billion dollars a year from oil/CH4/ coal producers, and they pass the tax on to their customers (gasoline, diesel, food, heating, electric, plastic, roads, and roofs, to name a few).  People each get a $1,300 check from the government.  This means half the population will vote for it because they come out ahead (called buying votes if you're pragmatic, or socialist redistribution if you lean that way).  The rebate is taxable as income; the government comes out $110 billion ahead on the Carbon ""Neutral"" Tax, and they say ""Neutral"" with a straight face.  Undocumented immigrants cannot apply for a tax refund; add another $25 billion to the governments coffers on their behalf."

The conservative, American Meteorological Society indicates that our willful blindness and greed will have effects well beyond the climate.

Sea level rise will not be gradual. Even assuming that the billions of tons of water that is currently being dumped down to the ground level of Greenland isn't creating a lubricant which eventually will allow the ice to free-flow into the northern oceans; it is only the friction to the islands surface that is currently holding the ice back. Then consider the same process is happening in Antarctica but is also coupled with the disappearance of the ice shelves which act as buttresses holding the glaciers from free flowing into the southern ocean. then factor in thermal expansions; the simple fact that warmer water takes up more space and It becomes clear that we are not looking at maintaining the current 3.4mm/yr increase in sea level rise (which incidentally is terrifying when you multiply it out over decades and centuries.) We will be looking at major calving events that will result in much bigger yearly increases coupled with an exponential increase in glacial melting. We know that every increase of 100ppm of C02 increases sea level by about 100 feet. We have already baked in 130 feet of sea level rise.

There has BEEN NO PROOF of Data Manipulation...Even Skeptic Curry claims that DATA today is FAR MORE ACCURATE thanks to the studies NOAA and NASA have done.
Your comment about models not predicting is simply a SCREAM about how ignorant you are:

American robins now migrate 12 days earlier than in 1994//Posted: 01 Apr 2020 12:08 PM PDT
A new study concludes that robin migration is kicking off earlier by about five days----> each decade. 
The study is also the first to reveal the environmental conditions along the migration route 
--------> that help the birds keep up with the changing seasons.

Moreover, 
""I add, there  ""Was and Is a long track-record "" in the "" scientific literature ""  of successful projections/predictions by climate models.

It was collected and documented by Barton Paul Levenson, I quoted Barton as follows below:
.
""Global Warming Scientists &  Climate Models have successfully predicted steady/increasing WARMING for over 65 YEARS!
.
See the 
1958   
1965 
AAAS (( the American Association for the Advancement of Science & Presidential Science Advisory Councils Research Reports & Warnings on Global Warming which causes Climate Change.)) 
These projections would start to be seen 50 years from 1965. ((( 2015 )))
1.
That the globe would WARM! 
.
((directly counter to the Mini ICE Age myth perpetuated by the Skeptic/Fossil Fuel Industrialists DEEP STATE.

.
11. They made a retrodiction for Last Glacial Maximum sea surface temperatures which was inconsistent with the paleo evidence, and better paleo evidence showed the models were right. 
.
12. They predicted a trend significantly different and differently signed from UAH satellite temperatures, and then a bug was found in the satellite data.

"Rick Kooi","2020-05-11T23:50:01Z","@Jenn smith   Got nothing to say about the science of EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF CO2 DAMAGING HUMAN LIFE....?
The Goldilocks levels for ALL LIFE ON EARTH 
has been, for millions of years, between 180pmm and 300ppm.
The damage to human immunity is after we have raised atmospheric concentrations by 43% ... which enables much higher concentrations in lower levels (CO2 is heavier than dry air) like basements, sealed rooms, protected glades...compounded in meeting rooms due to poor circulation and overcrowding.
.
With the understanding that Human Industry/Agriculture was PUMPING over 120 times MORE CO2 than all of the volcanoes, combined.
(working with H2O in a multiplier effect) 
& 2 Dz. other  Greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere than all Earth's Volcanoes, combined, every year.

The World's Leading Scientific Minds

Challenged
Questioned
Critiqued

.
In 1970, 
NASA launched the IRIS/satellite that Observed & Measured in detail the
Escaping Infra-Red THERMAL Low-Energy Radiation spectra between 400 cm-1 to 1600 cm-1. 
.
( Google:>     IRIS-Satellite Research)

In 1996, 
the Japanese Space Agency launched the IMG/satellite which recorded similar observations. 
.
(Google:.>     IMG-Satellite Research)
.
Both sets of data were compared to discern any changes in escaping 
.
infrared  thermal  radiation over the 26 year period 
.
(Google.>     Harries Research Study, 2001).
.
They found a Dramatic DROP in Escaping (earth cooling) InfraRed THERMAL Radiation 
at the Precise wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) & methane (CH4) absorb energy !

While ESCAPING Infra-Red THERMAL Radiation is DECREASING.
Green House Gases were  INCREASING! (hand in glove)
 .
The change in ESCAPING I.R. THERMAL radiation is consistent with theoretical expectations & Global Warming Science Predictions. 
.
Research & Numerous Studies have found: 
.
-------------------> ""direct experimental empirical evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect""/GLOBAL Warming.
.
This result has been confirmed by NUMEROUS subsequent Research & Studies using more recent satellite data, Digital Balloon Launches, etc.

"Richard Schaefer","2019-04-29T22:09:21Z","Since the end of the most recent period of global glaciation (Ice Age), 11,500 years ago, sea levels have risen about 415 feet/126 meters. 97% of that increase happened before Christ was born. That is why there are villages and cities scattered all over the coastal sea waters of the world.  

Since the end of the 500 years of the ""Little Ice Age"", around 1876 - during which time sea levels were fairly stable, the earth's glaciers advanced for miles and the freezing temperatures were responsible for the deaths of over 65 million people world wide;  and the destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army - sea levels have risen about 8.5 inches. Nothing really odd about the slightly increased annual sea level rise, after nearly 500 years of ""Global Cooling"" and increased glaciation. Further, I note that there have been 3 major periods of sea level rise - each lasting centuries - since the end of the last period of Global Glaciation, 11,500 years ago. 

Ice is the destroyer of civilization. Stuff grows well in the tropics or in a green house...on a glacier...not so much.

""CO2 Health Impacts in Confined Indoor Spaces

A considerable amount of recent literature worldwide has documented CO2 impacts in classrooms from kindergartens to universities 

(Bako-Biro et al 2011; 

Widory and Javoy 2003; 

Kukadia et al. 2005; 

Dijken et al. 5 2005; 

Branco et al. 2015; 

Heudorf et al. 2009; 

Santamouris et al. 2008; 

Ferreira and Cardoso 2014; 

Gaihre et al. 2014; 

Jurado, et al. 2014; 

Lee and Chang 2000; 

Muscatiello et al 2015; /

Carreiro-Martins et al. 2014).

.

Most agree levels of CO2 in 20-50% of classrooms commonly exceed 1,000 ppm and are often as high as 6,000 ppm for extended periods. Recorded impacts on health are of a minor nature but include sneezing, rales, wheezing, rhinitis, and asthma

 (Carreiro-Martins et al. 2014; 

Ferreira and Cardoso 2014).

.

Other symptoms; i.e. cough, headache, and irritation of mucous membranes, were also identified 

(Ferreira and Cardoso 2014). 

.

Lack of concentration was associated with CO2 levels above 1,000 ppm. 

Gaihre et al. (2014) show some neuro-physiologic symptoms (i.e., headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating) at CO2 levels greater than 1,000 ppm (Muscatiello et al. 2015).""

.

""In workplaces such as offices, high CO2 level impacts show a range of health effects similar to classrooms, depending on the number or density of workers and the types of ventilation systems 

(Lu et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2012, 

Seppanen et al. 1999). 

.

Such studies make a link between CO2 levels in offices and Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) with workers complaining of headaches, dizziness, fatigue, respiratory tract symptoms, eye symptoms, nasal and mucous membrane symptoms 

(Seppanen et al. 1999;

 Lu et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2012; 

Vehvil√§inen et al. 2016). 

Seppanen et al. (1999).""

Unless you ARE a turnip,

Kindly be advised that for tens of millions-upon-millions of years, all LIFE on Planet Earth has thrived on atmospheric CO2 & GH Gas levels working in a multiplier affect with water vapour at GOLDILOCKS LEVELS between 180ppm & 300ppm.

I mentioned the Milankovitch Cycles to show you how UN-NATURAL this sudden, atypical rise in temperatures has been.



THIS IS NOT AN INTERGLACIAL PEAK...that occurred 7500 years ago...this is a gross interruption in EARTH'S most powerful natural Cycles.



We know we are past the Holocene Optimum because science extensively studies Earth's Orbital Cycle.

We are still cycling AWAY from our Source of heat...the Sun.- ---------->We should be cooling!

We are still in an Axial Tilt away from our Source of heat...the Sun.-->We should be cooling!

Earth's Wobble is conducive --------------------------------------------------------------->to cooling.

IN FACT,

The Current Solar Cycle is a decrease in Solar OUTPUT for the last 40+ years.

WE

SHOULD

BE COOLING....but we are WARMING.  

========================

Noted Skeptic/Denier Dr. John Christie has just admitted that all Satellite Data now agrees with 40,000 digital ground stations that temperature have risen, NON-STOP, since 1978 at a century rate of 1.4 C.(0.14C/decade)

Prior to 1978, 

we have a century-long record of human measurements around the world of a long term temperature rise 

(0.85 to 1.15 C / century).

Here's Why Plants Aren't Just Growing Faster With All The CO2 in The Atmosphere
SEBASTIAN LEUZINGER, THE CONVERSATION  19 OCT 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is warming our climate, but it also affects plants directly.

A tree planted in the 1850s will have seen its diet (in terms of atmospheric carbon dioxide) double from its early days to the middle of our century. 
More CO2 generally leads to higher rates of photosynthesis and less water consumption in plants. 

So, at first sight,
it seems that CO2 can only be beneficial for our plants.

But things are a lot more complex than that. 
Higher levels of photosynthesis don't necessarily lead to more biomass production, let alone to more carbon dioxide sequestration.

At night, 
plants release CO2 just like animals or humans, and if those respiration rates increase simultaneously, the turnover of carbon increases, but the carbon stock doesn't. 

You can think of this like a bank account ‚Äì if you earn more but also spend more, you're not becoming any richer.

Even if plants grow more and faster, 
some studies show there is a risk for them to have shorter lifespans. This again can have negative effects on the carbon locked away in biomass and soils.

In fact, 
fast-growing trees (e.g. plantation forests) store a lot less carbon per surface area than old, undisturbed forests that show very little growth.

Another example shows that plants in the deep shade may profit from higher levels of CO2, leading to more vigorous growth of vines, faster turnover, and, again, less carbon stored per surface area.
.
Water savings

The effect of CO2 on the amount of water plants use may be more important than the primary effect on photosynthesis. Plants tend to close their leaf pores slightly under elevated levels of CO2, leading to water savings. 

In certain (dry) areas, this may indeed lead to more plant growth.

But again, 
things are much more complex and we don't always see positive responses.

Research we published in Nature, Plants this year on grasslands around the globe showed that while dry sites can profit from more CO‚ÇÇ, there are complex interactions with rainfall.

Depending on when the rain falls, some sites show zero or even negative effects in terms of biomass production.

Currently, 
a net amount of three gigatons of carbon are thought to be removed from the atmosphere by plants every year. This stands against over 11 gigatons of human-induced release of CO2.

It is also unclear what fraction of the three gigatons plants are taking up due to rising levels of CO2.

In summary, 
rising CO2 is certainly not bad for plants, and if we restored forested land at a global scale, we could help capture additional atmospheric carbon dioxide.

But such simulations are optimistic and rely on conversion of much needed agricultural land to forests. 

Reductions in our emissions are unavoidable, and we have very strong evidence that plants alone will not be able to solve our CO2 problem.

Additionally, the pollution laws are very strict in the USA compared to other parts of the world. For example, of the 50 world cities with the highest air pollution India had 25 cities, China 20 cities, and the Middle East 5 cities, the USA 0.  The Green New Deal would have a very miniscule impact on the World Pollution most likely much less than 1 %.

"James Watson","2019-03-25T12:20:46Z","While I‚Äôm extremely skeptical that CO2 (a gas that makes up less than ¬Ω of 1 percent) of the atmosphere) is causing global warming, I will side with the Lib/Dems on this issue. If in fact, we are facing extinction due to man-made global warming, we need a dramatic and effective response. Right? 

Here‚Äôs the problem. Solar and wind do not have sufficient energy density. It‚Äôs not even remotely close. ¬†To date renewables, which includes wind and solar along with biomass, hydro-electric, etc provides 11% of our total energy. Of this 11%, wind provides 21%. ¬†The math: 21% of 11% equals 2.3%. So wind provides 2.3% of our total energy. Solar provides 6% of the 11% which is .66%. Just over ¬Ω of 1 percent of our total energy. We have subsidized wind and solar over the last 20 or more year to the equivalent of 3 moon shots. Think about that one.

When you read about how solar can provide our energy needs, be very careful in the fine print. What you will almost always find is they are saying that it will provide enough to power our houses!!! I see this over, and over, and over and over again. Households only consume about 6% of our total consumption. What about the other 94%?

Elon Musk spoke about a postage stamp solar farm in the Texas panhandle, how it would provide all our energy. I looked it up. I did the math. He‚Äôs right, it will provide all of the energy for our homes. An area 100 miles by 100 miles. Sounds great. Except that will only get us 6% of where we need to go. So multiply that by 20 and you get the area of half the USA in solar panels in order to supply our entire energy needs. This is not a solution.

Solar and wind are not a viable option. It has to do with energy density. 

Solar and wind are the saving grace to the big oil interest. As long as we chase the red herring, the worldwide demand will continue to grow and consume fossil fuels. I‚Äôm sure they fund research and articles pontificating on the virtues of solar and wind while laughing all the way to the bank. There is only one energy source they fear. And, I‚Äôm sure they provide funding and articles that screaming about the dangers of this energy source. That source is nuclear.

Yes, we need to discuss the N-word, Nuclear. I‚Äôm against traditional nuclear water-pressurized reactors. They are inherently unsafe. However there is a different type of reactor that can‚Äôt melt down, creates extremely small amounts of waste, the waste generated is only radioactive for around 12 years, with a fraction radioactive for 300 years. They can be massed produced. They can be used to burn up or existing stockpiles of nuclear waste and create trillions of dollars of electricity. Unless you support Nuclear you are part of the problem.

In addition, the radioactivity produced from used control rods cannot be contained and prevented from hurting the environment. The radioactive decay of the control rods are contained in 1 of 2 things. A water pool in the plant (water stops radiation), or a lead-lined canister buried underground. Since the pools of plants fill up too quickly, we started burying it underground. The problem? The half-life of uranium is several million years. The lead line canisters can barely contain the radioactivity for 50-60 years. It then leaks into groundwater, which affects the plants, animals, and humans that rely on the water in the area. One cannot simply say nuclear will solve our issues. The fuel is rare and finite, our population continues to grow, and it leads to detrimental environmental impacts."

If you want to piss off a minister of climatology, or one of the myopic minions, try any of the following...
1) say ""CO2 is plant food.""
2) say ""Polar bears are thriving.""
3) say ""water vapor is a vastly more important green house gas, and it's wider infrared absorption bands already cover CO2's narrow bands.(*)
4) The earth is 15% greener now than when satellites first started taking pictures.  (**)
5) What ever science there once was has been hijacked by socialists.
6) Grand Solar Minimum.
7) We've had ice ages with 4,500 ppm CO2, and warm periods with 200 ppm CO2; clearly CO2 is not the control knob on the earth's temperature.
8) Termites emit way more methane than cows.
9) Why have the ice caps on Mars melted?
10) Al Gore bought seaside property; he ain't worried.


(*) Al Gore said in his movie, ""If you ignore the effect of water vapor, CO2 is the most powerful greenhouse gas.""  This is like saying, ""If you ignore that man with the machine gun, the guy with the pocket knife is the most dangerous man in the room.""


(**) and follow this up with the reason: plants lose water to gain CO2.  The 100 ppm increase has made it so that instead of losing 100 water molecules for every CO2 the plant captures, it now only loses 84.  The greening has turned up around the margins of deserts, and has nothing to do with humans planting anything."

The Permian Extinction Coincided  with a 1C Rise In Temperature per 7,500 years.
Human Industry/Activities are raising temps (CONTRARY TO NORMAL CYCLES) at a rate of 
about 1.4C Per 100 years.

Notice the difference !
We are raising temps. 75 times faster than the temperature increase  during the Permian Extinction"
"SociallyTriggered","2019-03-25T03:38:02Z","@Rick Kooi I didn't disagree that rapid changes can cause extinctions. However, we would need 5+ degree increase to see this. Even the natural daily fluctuations are less than 5 degrees so most species could survive this. In the case of global warming we are talking 1.4 degrees or less on average yearly temperatures. I just feel there bigger things to worry about that will cause major problems if not addressed. Ex. clean water"
"Rick Kooi","2019-03-24T22:22:58Z","@SociallyTriggered 
IT is not the increase in temperature that kills....over hundreds of thousands of years...there is next to no damage done....animals and plants can ADAPT and EVOLVE.

But at the naturally fast speed I cited, 1C per 7500 years actually killed off a huge percentage of life on earth and in the seas!

NOW consider that temperature changes that have occurred.
1880-1980... depending upon the data source   ------------> 0.85C to 1.15C in that century.
According to satellite readings, 
Dr. John Christy has admitted the temps have  risen ---->0.14C per decade EVERY DECADE SINCE 1978 !

...that is a century rate of 1.4C...an increase over the prior century of  over 30%! !
-----------------------------------------------
THERE SIMPLY IS NOTHING NATURAL ABOUT THIS SUDDEN INCREASE IN TEMPS.

All the causes of glaciation (the milankovitch cycles) indicate through this day...that we should be cooling.
ADD TO THAT
Solar Energy Output has Decreased over the recent decades, 
but  Global Warming has Increased.

It Is Not The Sun Causing ALL or ANY of this rapid Warming.

"SociallyTriggered","2019-03-24T16:21:21Z","@Rick Kooi Look deeper into this. An increase in temperature does kill some species but also allows for more life to exist. The science doesn't suggest that all the climate change is man made. The solar activity shows a stronger connection to the changes we are experiencing. Sure man has an impact but it is small. The change we are experiencing is for the most part natural. Also if you look into the long term climate models they are based on ice cores which show that first temperature increases then carbon in the air increases. So don't worry the world won't end in 12 years."
"Rick Kooi","2019-03-24T15:54:49Z","@SociallyTriggered 
""small rise in the world's temperature""
From the late 19th century thru about 1980 we have MEASURED a temperature increase  of .85C to 1.15C averaged over the century.
Since 1978, Skeptic/Denier Dr. John Christy as recently, finally, admitted that temperatures have averaged every decades since 11/1978...an increase in temps of 0.14 C per decade.....that is a century rate of 1.4C.

So we have  .85/1.15 C per century
Now
WE HAVE     1.4 C per century

In geologic History we know that an average natural temperature change is 1C in 7,500 years.

NOTE THE INCREASE....that 1C per 7500 years produced large species die offs."

Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist

""Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 
97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists 
-- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals 
-- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. 
.
The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts.
.
The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus.
.
James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. 
.
Here's what he says:
If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles.
The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%.
[...]
The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus 
is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, 
I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles 
and 
JUST 4 
of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.
.
His full paper is linked from that site.
Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal 
Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. 
They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper 
ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change.
. 
* They found 38 papers. *
.
A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data.
In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup.
Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods,
or 
basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics.
[...]
We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record.
.
Page on springer.com
It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them.
The authors of this paper -- disclosure: 
I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times 
-- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant.
.
But what about that 97%?
.
Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: 
Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.
.
In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.
.
Scientific Overwhelming Agreement /  consensus: 
Earth's climate is warming
.
Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%:
J. Cook, et al, ""Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming 
in the scientific literature,"" Environmental Research Letters 
Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024
Quotation from page 3: ""Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW 
[Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the 
scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW 
in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.‚Äù
W. R. L. Anderegg, ‚ÄúExpert Credibility in Climate Change,‚Äù 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 
(21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107.
P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, 
""Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,"" 
Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; 
DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002.
N. Oreskes, ‚ÄúBeyond the Ivory Tower:

(3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618.
.
So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, 
published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among 
climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a 
tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements.
1.
You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 
2.
It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 
3.
And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result.
4.
In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREEMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high."

"Casey","2019-03-17T03:40:45Z","The truth about climate change is the US government has been spraying aerosoles for almost 20 or so years. The Chinese department of geoengineering has open sourced the science. 2004 Beijing Olympic headlines (in China) declared that the government would make sure it didn't rain for the Olympics. Meanwhile US government and NASA claim there's no way to alter or control the weather. This is of course because they have already weaponized weather. If you could send a drought or a hurricane or a storm you could possibly get a foreign policy change that you couldn't without a war. I've personally researched the science and it's not so hard to understand. Weather is hot fronts and cold fronts. You can cloud seed with metal cloud aerosols, and then microwave them with arrays like HAARP. The radio waves will react with the metal, heating them up just like in a microwave. That's a man-made hot front. I personally witnessed 5 years of unmarked Boeing's spraying the leading edge of the storm fronts i tracked as a surfer. The hot fronts caused the storms to speed past the Sierra nevadas, and dump on the Midwest. This is why California had a drought and the Midwest was flooded with Pacific water. Normally the storms dump over the California Central valley and Sierra nevadas and the watersheds filling the California reservoirs. 
Geoengineering is real. 
Also in grade school I learned that there has been numerous ice ages and climate change is an unstoppable event. But then again mystery teachings promise man will conquer nature through intellect and technology. 
I'm sickened of the thought of government taxing for climate change, especially when u.s. military movement is the one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels. Our military doesn't need an empire cross the world, but should be recalled to within a hundred miles of our own borders. I remember back under Obama when the left and right United under #NoWarWithSyria and they had to delay and distracted with Trump and antifa. John stossel thanks for keeping it libertarian bro. 
Sincerely,
A liberaltarian"

There are real studies done by hundreds of scientists all over the world that prove that climate change is a man made problem that should be taken seriously. The IPCC is possibly the most transparent, neutral, reliable and thorough authority on the subject and they say, without a shred of doubt, that drastic measures need to be made to prevent man made global warming on affecting many countries negatively: https://www.ipcc.ch/. Stossels views are also very US centric, and doesn't realize that US:s actions on its own has also massive consequences to other countries, and its already happening in countries like Kiribati that will cease to exist in a matter of years. US is the second biggest polluter, and has one of the biggest emissions per capita in the world. Even if man made climate change happens to be a hoax where thousands of vetted scientists from all over the world agreed to take part in; in the end limited resources like oil and coal will not be needed as much, and the world will end up a bit better. One day the oil will run out, but the sun, wind, and water won't. We'll have to address the issue one day, and it's never a ""good time"" to put funds into it."

Things like air pollution, while having the biggest impact locally, can spread pretty far.  For example, the native people in Lapland are exposed to mercury and organic compounds that spread by air.  It's hard to get away from some things.
As for population, projections are for Europe to decline very slightly, all other continents are still increasing, Africa by about 200% from 2000 to 2050.  India will exceed China in population by 2030, 1.53 vs 1.44 billion.
The elephant in the room is the potential for wars over resources."
"kiyosen L.","2019-03-17T20:47:52Z","@Mark R all in all i think that population growth is more of a regional issue though, unless you are making the point of how their heavy industrialization affects global warming which is as this video points out, not fully determined whether its a man made issue or is something else, it doesnt really affect the rest of the word, the air pollution tends to just make the air in local cities bad, they destroy their local ecosystems but really thats more to the concern of the country who is doing this to themselves, the west has a pretty stable and not so bad population and the over populated asian countries are looking at a steep decline in population as the older generations die off due to low birth rates"
"Mark R","2019-03-17T19:48:12Z","@kiyosen L. That's true, but population decrease is usually very slow.  For example, Some European countries are declining, but overall Europe is still growing, but slowly at less than 1%.
In developing countries, the population is increasing rapidly.  Here you run several risks.  Resource availability, or lack, especially food and clean water.  The other is that as they grow and start to develop, they need more energy.  This often comes from coal, which is cheap and abundant.  Other forms, such as the massive Inga 3 dam in the Congo, tend to forgo any real environmental or societal impacts (think the 3 Gorges dam).
I would still argue that we need to stabilize world population at current levels, and then slowly work to reduce it."
"kiyosen L.","2019-03-17T19:25:46Z","@Mark R the issue is once a country modernizes itself it usally levels off or decreases in population, however when a country is developing it sees a massive population growth"
"Mark R","2019-03-17T17:35:26Z","@kiyosen L. Here's a link from NOAA on hurricanes.  Just be careful when anything is based on models.  They may be ok for the short term, but multi-decade or century is unlikely given the inherent error.  Also, anything has to be shown to be statistically significant.  Natural year-to-year variability makes this difficult over shorter time periods, a few decades.
We, in the US, don't have a bad population problem, but when you think about sub-Saharan Africa doubling in population in the next 30 years or so, that's a huge problem.  Several studies have estimated the long-term sustainable carrying capacity of the Earth for humans is probably around 2 billion.  Granted, the studies are very speculative."

""....the most striking feature of this early age of mammals is that it was almost unbelievably hot, so hot that around 50 million years ago there were crocodiles, palm trees, and sand tiger sharks in the Arctic Circle. On the other side of the blue-green orb, in waters that today would surround Antarctica, sea-surface temperatures might have topped an unthinkable 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with near-tropical forests on Antarctica itself. There were perhaps even sprawling, febrile dead zones spanning the tropics, too hot even for animal or plant life of any sort.

"ItIsRiley","2019-03-09T12:06:47Z","@laurejon I'm not sure why you brought up the fact that the CO2 is not higher in the atmosphere and then reference to clouds. Clouds are also low in our atmosphere just like most of the greenhouse gasses we are producing. Clouds typically only go up to about 20,000 ft int the atmosphere. The atmosphere technically doesn't have a defined border but we typically consider anything beyond ~62mi (~100km) to be in outerspace. 
While CO2 is good for plants, too much CO2 could have detrimental effects. 
I would be very interested in seeing your reference material saying that more CO2 is better and that it has to be high in the atmosphere to actually be a problem, unless that is not what you meant. 

Here is some simple reference material explaining different contributors and effects, they also have explanations for all of them if you click ""learn more"". It is all located on the interactive graphs in the bottom half of the page.   https://www.climate.gov/"

That a presumably intelligent person believes SUCH rubbish.
.
""The notion that climate scientists either invented or exaggerated global warming is one that‚Äôs been rumbling around for quite some time. 
.
It‚Äôs often used as an argument to oppose the theory of global warming but it‚Äôs not something that has ever been substantiated ‚Äìdespite numerous requests for links to corroborating evidence.
.
It‚Äôs actually quite a bizarre claim given that global warming will be celebrating it‚Äôs 200th birthday in a few days.
1.
The first scientific connection to global warming dates from 1811 when the physicist and astronomer Simeon Denis Poisson speculated that atmospheric pollution led to increased temperatures.
2.
In 1824 the French scientist Jean-Baptiste Fourier (a colleague of Poisson‚Äôs) put forward the notion that Earth's atmosphere was retaining heat. 
His published his findings in a work entitled ‚ÄúGeneral Remarks on the Temperature of the Terrestrial Globe & the Planetary Spaces‚Äù
http://burgess1837.geologist-1011.mobi/
3.
1856 ""...the work of Eunice Foote, who three years prior to the start of Tyndall's laboratory research, conducted similar experiments on absorption of radiant energy 
by atmospheric gases, such as CO2 and water vapor. 
.
The presentation of her report at a major scientific convention in 1856 was accompanied by postulation that even modest increases in the concentration of CO2 could result in significant atmospheric warming.""

www.searchanddiscovery.com/.. 
4.
In 1896 the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius was the first person to produce documented empirical evidence as to the existence of global warming, this was published in his paper ""On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground""  (carbonic acid being the chemical name of the time for carbon dioxide).
http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_...
.
It‚Äôs sometimes claimed that scientists falsify the theory of global warming in order to receive funding.
. 
The problem with this argument is that any funding that is provided will be strictly controlled and in most cases will be monitored and audited by the funding institution or by the funding body and / or their appointed auditors. 
.
ANY deliberate misappropriation of funding would be a criminal offence for which the offender could be jailed. 

This has never happened.

The Virginia State Attorney ‚Äì Ken Cuccinelli ‚Äì embarked on something of a witch-hunt against the climate scientist Michael Mann and invoked the ** Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act 
claiming that Mann had misappropriated public funds by producing DOCTORED and/or FRAUDULENT DATA to support the Global Warming THESIS.

The Judge threw the case out.-------------->  http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release...

NEWS MEDIA DESCRIBED THE CASE as having been ""LAUGHED OUT OF COURT""
.
I‚Äôm actually a climate scientist myself and I can assure you that it‚Äôs nothing to do with the money (I work in the private sector so there‚Äôs almost no public funding available). 
Anyone embarking on a climate science study course is well aware that they‚Äôre never going to become rich. 
.
If they were more concerned about money they would use their scientific background and work in petrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. It‚Äôs also assumed that climate scientists do nothing other than study climate change. 
In reality, 
this makes up a small proportion of the workload and many scientists will go through their whole career without ever researching climate change.
The argument falls flat on it‚Äôs face yet again when you consider that companies with the most to lose from climate change being a reality ‚Äìthe oil and power companies 
‚Äì have their own in-house climate scientists and they are reporting exactly the same as those working in the public sector.
.
Furthermore, 
climate change is a multi-disciplinary subject and involves scientists from a wide spectrum including botanists, marine biologists, oceanographers, cosmologists, physicists, 
atmospheric chemists etc. 
.
*It stretches credibility beyond all forms of reason to believe that such a huge number of people could be involved in a scam and not one person has ever spoken out.
It‚Äôs also worth bearing in mind that the first warnings made to the US government about impending climate change came from research conducted by the US Army at the Camp Century base in Greenland. 
.
Are we also to believe that the military are also involved in some sort of global conspiracy?
PS ‚Äì The psychological aspect of climate change can be found within the realms 
of the psychology of denial and the diffusion of responsibility. 
These conditions manifest themselves as 
a) a filter mechanism that inhibits 
the acceptance of conflicting ideas and opinions in order to maintain a delusion and 
b) the reluctance to become involved on the basis that someone else will deal with the problem.

was once one of the most polluted rivers in the United States as represented by the multitude of times it has caught fire, a recorded number of thirteen starting in 1868.
.
The most potent blaze occurred in 1952 which caused over $1.3 million in damages however,
the most fatal fire happened in 1912 with a documented five deaths. The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river.
This was in part because of the developing precedence that sanitation held over industrial actions; the United States was becoming more eco-aware.
.
Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident. This brought mass amount of attention to the Cleveland area
and added pressure for hygienic regulation.

Inspired by the 1969 river fire,
Congress was determined to resolve the issue of land pollution, not just in Cleveland, but throughout the United States.
.
The legislature passed the National Environment Protection Act (NEPA) which was signed into law on January 1, 1970. This act helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which would be given the duties to manage environmental risks and regulate various sanitary-specific policies.
.
One of the first legislations that the EPA put-forth was the Clean Water Act (1972), which mandated that all rivers throughout the United States be hygienic enough to safely allow mass amounts of swimmers and fish within the water by 1983. Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District has invested over $3.5 billion towards the purification of the river and the development of new sewer systems. There is a projection that over the next thirty years the city of Cleveland will further endow over $5 billion to the upkeep of the wastewater system.

The river is now home to about sixty different species of fish, there has not been another river fire since 1969, and yearly new waste management programs develop to ensure the sanitation of Cleveland's waterways...."""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIU


The Greenhouse Gas Demo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwtt51gvaJQ


The average temperature of the globe is increasing.  NASA and NOAH have recorded this.  13 of 14 of the hottest years occurred this century.  Published papers from 1965 to 1979,  about 66 percent indicate the globe is warming,  about 20 percent say the indicate the globe's temperature is stable, the last 14 percent indicate the globe is cooling.  

From 1993 to 2015, sea levels have risen an average of 3 millimeters per year.  Ice on Antarctica and Greenland have been melting at unprecedented rates.  Arctic Sea ice is continuing to decline.  Don't forget about the new shipping lanes have opened through the Arctic, allowing ships to bypass the Panama Canal.

The Sun is not a factor in the Earth's rising temperature.  Since 1960 the Sun's solar output has been slowing declining AND the earth's temperature has rapidly increasing.

It's true that humans output about 30 Billion tons CO2 yearly and it's just a fraction compared 720 Billion tons output yearly by natural sea and land processes.  But this does NOT mean humans are not responsible for it.  The system was balanced by land and oceans absorbing that same amount.  This balance kept CO2 in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 ppm for 800,000 years.  Now it's at about 400 ppm and still rising.  **Yes this is man made CO2 because the man made isotope carbon 13 is less common in fossil fuels than it is naturally found in the atmosphere.  Over time we have seen the concentrations of carbon 13 decreasing.**  BTW Volcanoes emit about 0.25 Billion tons of CO2, not a big factor in CO2 output.

Warmer air can absorb more moisture than colder air.  Warmer air and warmer water contain more energy giving hurricanes more destructive power (Hurricanes Andrew, Irma, and Maria).  Melting ice reduces the reflectivity of the Earth's surface allowing more sunlight to warm up the atmosphere.  This ongoing feedback loop will cause an increase of 3 deg Celsius in the atmosphere."

These guys on the right listen to the few scientists who agree with them. This video states that there is no economic model that can predict the future, but nonetheless we can use rational thinking and data to see that socialism would never work. But when it comes to greenhouse gases we know that CO2 has the effect of warming the planet and that we dont know whats the tipping point, but we know that the pace is going faster then ever and that is the problem, since nature has a hard time to addapt. Even if it is not: should we gamble when the odds are against us? Venus for exemple is much hotter than mercury, due to the green house effect.

Lots of "" predictions "" about something called a GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM ...
These Cooling Events / MINI Ice Ages have been predicted by outlier scientists, propelled by thousands of PRESS RELEASED from the PR departments of all those billionaire FOSSIL FUEL Industrialists.


Who Sells heating products, which sell like hotcakes when people are scared of MINI ICE AGES? ? ? ?


Yep!   Those Fossil Fuel Billionaire industrialists ! ! ! 



Sooooo, how do you think it happened that these Extreme Cooling Events, Mini Ice Ages have been predicted...not onl in the 1970s, but again in the 80s and the 90s...then as we entered the 21st century... 

1. The Global Warming PAUSE!
2. The Global Warming HIATUS!
3. GLOBAL COOLING again
4. THE GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM!

==========================
From the INVENTORS of the Global Warming PAUSE, HIATUS, and COOLING...
Dr. Roy Spencer and Dr. John Christie 

==========================
‚Äî THEY reported/admitted  just a few months ago, that UAH data NOW confirms
an
‚Äú UPWARD Global climate temperature trend SINCE Nov.16, 1978, Temperatures have been increasing for 40 year !
[of] +0.14+ C / decade  [1/4F]/decade.‚Äù-------
* * * 
THAT amounts to a rate of  1.4C / 100 years.
NOTE,  temps. HAD risen  0.85  over the last century.
.
THIS NEW CHRISTY RATE  1.4C / 100 years, is a 30%+ increase in the rate of warming!
.
Compare that to Geological History of Temperature Changes:
a life-threateningly rapid increase in historic temps averaged 

1C in 7500 years which Led to large species Die-Offs.

1.4 C  by humans per 100 yrs
1.0 C  historical norm 7500 yrs

HUMANS are raising temperatures around the world 50-75 times FASTER than Plants & Animals are able to adapt!
* * * * * *
Spencer & Christy
.
.ADMITTING for the FIRST TIME:
1. NO PAUSE in Global Warming ! ..... NONE!
2. NO HIATUS in Global Warming! ..... NONE!
3. Sure as hell, > NO COOLING   ! ....,,,..NONE!
.
Dr. SPENCER:
‚Äúmy UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, 
is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing SPURIOUS COOLING because RSS is still 
using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..."""

The Grand Solar Minimum 
& variations of that theme have been predicted by Petro-Chemical PR Departments since the 70s
...IN ORDER to undermine efforts in Congress to limit Toxic Chemical Dumping into our atmosphere (CO2). 

By the end of the 70s, Fossil Fuel Industry succeeded in selling over a million oil furnaces ... based on the "" FEAR "" of a "" MINI ICE AGE "" ....and defeated ANY efforts to mitigate Global Warming /Climate Change in the future.
This Propaganda Technique was used in the '80s, in the '90s...changed a bit around 2000 when they started saying the GLOBAL WARMING was going to ""PAUSE"", was in ""HIATUS"", and was, again, leading to Global Cooling.
.

How did that Right Wing Prediction work out?
.
Noted Skeptics Dr. Roy Spencer & Dr. John Christie have recently admitted that Global Warming continued, unpaused, by 0.14C per decade...nearly triple their predicted amount SINCE the 1970s.

18 of the 19 Hottest Years on Record Have Occurred Since 2001
https://uproxx.com/news/warmest-years-on-earth

The five hottest years have all been in the past five years. What‚Äôs more: 18 of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001. 

================
The last 'grand'-minimum event
 ‚Äî a disruption of the sun's 11-year cycle of variable sunspot activity
 ‚Äî happened in the mid-17th century. 

Known as the Maunder Minimum, it occurred between 1645 and 1715, Combined with the longer span of time when parts of the world became sufficiently cold that the period was called the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1300 to 1800.

But it's HIGHLY UNLIKELY that we'll see a return to the cold from centuries ago, researchers reported in a new study.

 Since the Maunder Minimum, global average temperatures have been on the rise, driven by Global Warming created Climate Changes.
.
Though a new decades-long dip in solar radiation could SLOW global warming a bit
YOU WILL need 
VERY Sensitive instruments 
in order to even notice it.

That's right kids, global warming is year round, it doesn't just make your summer beach trip a little sweatier. This is the silliest thing I've seen on youtube in at least a week.

God, that part about a solar subsidy hurting the poor, the hits just keep on coming in this video, a subsidy only hurts the poor if the country's tax system is unfair, that's like calling the drying of a watering hole a bad thing because it robs the lions of an easy hunting ground. And that part ripped straight from the Rupert Murdoch machine narrative, that it's all a conspiracy theory, that ooo, climate scientist need to push a narrative so that they can buy new jet ski's. The idea that scientists somehow need this drama in their lives is just laughable. There are a million things they'd rather be researching, things that haven't already been settled yet, ya know, that's kind of what scientific research is for. Instead they have this duty to the public to keep harping on this one tired and settled debate, because some Oil Executive keeps dolling out wads of cash to conservative PAC's to fight them.

I mean, Jesus, it's already been proven that Shell is and has been fully aware of climate change and their company's own impact on it, they're just slowing down the public's action so they can milk as much money as they can from their current technology set and production plans. The second the world runs out of oil or the public finally turns against it, they'll have already made sure that they, and only they, have the proper patents to ensure ownership of  the future generation of clean energy. It's not a conspiracy theory, so much as they just all think alike, they're getting ahead of the competition, and they're duping the easily duped to give them the time they need."

First of all, the fossil fuels are a very limited resource and once they end they are not easily coming back as they are non renewable resources. Currently the cost of alternative energy is still high, but we will research how to lower the cost of alternative energy until it becomes affordable. It is only a matter of time before putting solar panels on your house and battery cost less than the electric bill in the future. Then once we make the $5000 to $10,000 electric car, dealers won't know what to do with all that gas guzzling inventory they built up. It is coming slowly and steadily and once that happens, all government subsidies will end since the free market will become enough for alternative energy. But the problem is the huge dependence on fossil fuels and we can't get out of this situation easily. We also have the dependence on debt to worry about. Carbon Dioxide itself is not the poison, but the fact it is the most emitted greenhouse gas is important since water gets to join the water cycle and carbon dioxide acidifies the ocean.

"Anders Welander","2019-02-17T05:52:01Z","I'm a scientist with a PhD in physics. A number of years ago I began to study the climate issue because I had been hearing so many insane statements from politicians. I can only conclude what I knew from the beginning that there's no way to predict how the climate will evolve in the future. Even if we could install a planetary climate control system, what temperature should we set it to? What will please future generations the most? Finally, even if the control system could be installed and the best temperature setting established there will still remain the problem that it will cost 1 billion times more than it's worth!
We don't know how CO2 varied before direct measurements. The ice cores don't show fluctuations on shorter time scales. There's reason to believe the current rise is mainly natural. There is carbon in the air, there is carbon in living things, there is carbon in dead things, some of the dead stuff is coal and oil. There's a huge reserve of carbon that is already in circulation. We're just adding a little. CO2 is the gas that produces life. It's the last step before a carbon atom contributes to life. Now they want to stop that atom. The greenhouse effect from CO2 is negligible. The assumption how water vapor depends on CO2 is useless speculation. Modeling of clouds is very hard. Even if all that modeling stuff is improved there will still remain the things we don't that we don't know.
The good news is there's no reason to worry about the CO2.
The bad news is Western civilization is under constant attacks from leftists that are coming up with one insane plan after another for how to destroy all we hold dear."

Let me start from the beginning, the Earth is heated by the Sun. Then the heat (in the form of infrared light) must first pass through the atmosphere heat the Earth what is not removed by the heating of the Earth is reflected back into space.


The ‚ÄúGreen house gases‚Äù reflect back to the earth to add heat is what they (Global warming people) are claiming.


The question I have is why dose no one want to account for ‚ÄúGreen House Gases‚Äù not reflect some of the infrared into space before it reaches the Earth?


All things being equal the infrared coming from the Sun should be more than the infrared reflected away from the Earth then reflected back. Should this not cause the Earth to cool from the lack of infrared reaching the surface of the Earth with the increase of ‚ÄúGreen House Gases‚Äù.


The other thing they ignore is that the Earth‚Äôs orbit in not a perfect circle. The orbit increases & decreases over time which I have read in the ‚ÄúClimate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica‚Äù. In which they explain the climate change by ‚Äúmuch of the variability occurs with periodicities corresponding to that of the precession, obliquity and eccentricity of the Earth‚Äôs orbit‚Äù

It is rather hubris that man thinks he has such control over his planet. However, it may just be possible that we could be tipping the scale meaning we could be advancing the change. If that's the case then we are far, far too late. It's also rather hurbris to think that we can  ""change it back""

"Mark Van Horne","2019-02-14T07:06:24Z","I like John Stossel, but I don't agree with his conclusions on this video.  For one, I don't think that the debate should be if climate change is dangerous.  Even if it doesn't kill us, do we want a world without polar ice caps, polar bears and penguins, orcas,  with more mosquitos, bark beetles that don't die off each winter, so we have more dead trees and more wildfires?  We have 8 billion people on the planet but less than 4000 tigers in the wild.  How F'd up is that?  Stossel makes it sound as though the science of climate change is focused on the last few hundred years, by saying ""it's gone up and down the last few hundred years and it will continue to do so.  But's that's just not true.  By sampling ices cores hundreds of feet below the surface of the arctic ice, we know how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere throughout history, by studying fossil records and tree rings, we know a lot about weather patterns.  This is a much more long range issue than a few degrees in a hundred years.

The interview with Pat Michaels was interesting.  I looked up the ""Cato Institute"" and found that it changed it's name from the Charles Koch Foundation, two years after it was formed.  Koch Industries owns 4000 miles of petroleum pipeline, refines 80,000 barrels of oil per day, explores for gasoline, does ranching etc.  So this spokesman from a think tank funded by a petroleum company is supposedly  more credible than the scientists that say global warming is real?  You're saying he has no vested interest in calling it a hoax?  Really?

Think tanks like the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation purport to be all about common sense, but their goal is to obscure science.  Yes, government programs have to fight for funding, but they are trying to help their constituents, unlike groups funded by big business whose main objective is to make sure the rights of businesses trump everyone else rights.

Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: 
Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.
.
In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.
.
Scientific Overwhelming Agreement /  consensus: 
Earth's climate is warming
.
Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%:
J. Cook, et al, ""Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming

Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024
Quotation from page 3: ""Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW 
[Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the 
scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW 
in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.‚Äù
W. R. L. Anderegg, ‚ÄúExpert Credibility in Climate Change,‚Äù 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109

(3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618.
.
So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, 
published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among 
climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a 
tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements.
1.
You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 
2.
It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 
3.
And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result.
4.
In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high."

"Stan Shumer","2019-11-14T19:19:30Z","@Sean TV What the media says is irrelevant. We both already know the media will continue to misrepresent information as long as there is an agenda in motion. This is not news to me. And I'm already aware that there exists studies that are funded by special interests, but they are typically those directly or indirectly in affiliation with the Fossil Fuel Industry. Those who stand to lose billions in the wake of a mass energy transformation. If studies published from scientific institutions around the world predominately support AGW, this is a pretty good indication as to what interests are tampering with the evidence. And no nonsense theories of new world order agendas discredits this obvious consensus."
"Sean TV","2019-11-14T18:47:41Z","@Stan Shumer call it whatever you want but it's pop culture science and it is everywhere. Mainstream science = what the media disseminates, most of which is pseudoscience and ridden with propaganda. You say something doesn't exist but all you've done is shown your inability to think rationally. You can't think of a way pseudoscience is performed and manipulated by bought out ""scientific"" studies? Most science that is performed is not organic and is done to with preconceived ideas in order to attain specific wanted results. This is news to you? Give me a break!"

"Rick Kooi","2022-05-07T14:27:38Z","HA HA HA ..... it was a localized report from a Dept. of Commerce...
..
""...October 1922 and published in the Monthly Weather Review:

The Arctic seems to be warming up. Reports from fisherman, seal hunters, and explorers who sail the seas about Spitzbergen and the far eastern Arctic, all point to a radical change in climatic conditions, and hitherto underheard-of high temperatures in that part of the earth‚Äôs surface.
.

In August, 1922, the Norwegian Department of Commerce sent an expedition to Spitzbergen and Bear Island under the leadership of Dr. Adolf Hoel, lecturer on geology at the University of Christiania. Its purpose was to survey and chart the lands adjacent to the Norwegian mines on those islands, take soundings of the adjacent waters, and make other oceanographic investigations.

Ice conditions were exceptional. 
In fact, 
so little ice has never before been noted. The expedition all but established a record, sailing as far north as 81¬∞ 29‚Ä≤ in ice-free water. 

This is the farthest north ever reached with modern oceanographic apparatus.



The character of the waters of the great polar basin has heretofore been practically unknown. Dr. Hoel reports that he made a section of the Gulf Stream at 81¬∞ north latitude and took soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters. 

These show the Gulf Stream very warm, and it could be traced as a surface current till beyond the 81st parallel. The warmth of the waters makes it probable that the favorable ice conditions will continue for some time.



In connection with Dr. Hoel‚Äôs report, it is of interest to note the unusually warm summer in Arctic Norway and the observations of Capt. Martin Ingebrigsten, who has sailed the eastern Arctic for 54 years past. He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1918, that since that time it has steadily gotten warmer, and that to-day the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of 1868 to 1917.

Many old landmarks are so changed as to be unrecognizable. Where formerly great masses of ice were found, there are now often moraines, accumulations of earth and stones. At many points where glaciers formerly extended far into the sea they have entirely disappeared.

As interesting 
as this nearly century-old article might be 
from a modern perspective, however, it isn‚Äôt substantive evidence either for or against the concept of anthropogenic global warming. 

As documented elsewhere, the warming phenomena observed in 1922 proved to be indicative only of a ""local event in Spitzbergen"", not a trend applicable to the Arctic as a whole."

A booming of plant life, such as plants humans use for food, is a good thing for life on earth, animal life and plant life.  On the ice topic anyone can see that if you have a glass of water with ice cubes in it and you let the ice cube melt, the glass of water doesn't get deeper and overflow. Nope. That wouldn't happen with the ice caps melting either. Does human activity really cause global warming?  Earth had global warming that melted the ice ages back when men sat in their caves with a tiny fire to keep them warm.  The sun caused the climate change that melted the fields of ice during the ice ages. The sun is still a huge impact on climate, changing it without man's influence."

The frozen portion of the Arctic ocean is, therefore, already in the global body of water we call the oceans. If it melts, the sea levels will not rise, as that volume of water is already in the global ocean. 
In fact, sea levels will fall, ever so slightly, because as water freezes, it expands. Ergo- the VOLUME of water in the world's oceans would be slightly LESS if the polar ice cap were to melt, leading sea levels to fall."

Today, human agriculture and industry are driving  temps. --------------------------> 0.85 to 1.15 C per 100 years.

.
Now we are engaged in a great EXPERIMENT on ALL HUMAN LIFE ON EARTH !

From 180ppm-290ppm --------> we have driven CO2 up to 412ppm !

""A new report revels 42% of global coal capacity is currently unprofitable,

This industry-disrupting trend comes down to dollars and cents, 
as the cost of renewable energy plumets  below fossil fuel generation.

Across the U.S., 
renewable energy is beating KILLER coal Electric on cost: 
The price to build new wind and solar has fallen below the cost of simply running existing coal-fired power plants in Red and Blue states.  
For example, 
Colorado‚Äôs Xcel will retire 660 megawatts (MW) of coal capacity ahead of schedule in favor of renewable sources and battery storage, and reduce costs in the process.  

Midwestern utility MidAmerican will be the first utility to reach 100% renewable energy by 2020 without increasing customer rates, 
and 
Indiana‚Äôs NIPSCO will replace 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of coal with wind and solar.
.
Lazard‚Äôs annual ... Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis reports solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind costs have dropped an extraordinary 88% and 69% since 2009, respectively.  Meanwhile, coal and nuclear costs have increased by 9% and 23%, respectively.  

Even without accounting for current MASSIVE FOSSIL FUEL subsidies, renewable energy costs can be considerably lower than the marginal cost of conventional energy technologies.
In other words, 
customers save money when utilities replace existing coal with wind or solar .""

Action was taken worldwide to drastically reduce Chlorofluorocarbon emissions and ozone layer depletion was halted and reversed (but not yet fully restored to pre-industrialized world levels).  The ozone layer plays an important role in attenuating UV radiation from the sun (and space, in general).  A sudden reduction in ozone protection would most likely have deleterious effect on the skin, and other organs, of exposed skin mammals who did not take other measures to protect themselves from solar exposure.  In the (very) long term, if the ozone layer were completely obliterated, evolution would favor exposed skin mammals that could tolerate the additional exposure.

""EXTREME VETTING""  .

KEY TRUMP Foreign Policy Advisor, 
National Security Advisor, & 
Republican Campaigner 
General  Michael Flynn‚Äôs
confessed  actions  violated the LAWS of the United States & the State of Virginia. 
.
As a high-ranking member of the U.S. military, with high security clearance, it was ILLEGAL for him to accept money from any  FOREIGN POWER !  & He Was TOLD not to accept the money, because it would be foundout.
... 
FROM A SANCTIONED ENEMY STATE !
$200,000 from RUSSIAN 'business interests' / 'lobbyists'/ KGB/FSB
$600,000 from TURKISH 'business interests' / tied-at-the-hip to RUSSIAN KBG/FSB.
.
1.
He was warned by the Pentagon that it would be "" ILLEGAL "" for him to do so. 
HE DID IT ANYWAY !
2.
He was continuing to accept foreign money even as he was part of a campaign for President.
3.
He was APPOINTED National Security Adviser to the President of the Untied States while 
accepting foreign money,
.
(( which is a damn Powerful position))
and
HE REFUSED to disclose his income from the hostile internationally SANCTIONED enemy Russian EMPIRE.
.
Manafort & Flynn  FIRST  ATTEMPTED  to obey US Federal Law by registering as AGENTS for a foreign nation.
..
in March, 2017
LONG AFTER BEING FIRED and Subpoenaed 
...attempted to claim that status back dated several years...prior to the Trump campaign
& during the Trump Campaign / Transition, into his presidency.
.
Hillary Clinton broke State Department rules.
But
10  (TEN !) vigorous / vicious Congressional REPUBLICAN investigations 
.
$100 Million + tax payer money.
&
4 DOJ & FBI (Republican Led) investigations.
.
$75 MILLION more in taxpayer money.
.
all found insufficient EVIDENCE that she had broken any laws.
.
$175,000,000+ spent and NOT ONE INDICTMENT.
Not one indictment on any charge in any state in the Union.
*
*
General Michael Flynn
broke many United States LAWS and Virginia State Laws.
Congress had barely begun its first, very reluctant investigation,
& had already come to that conclusion.

General Flynn was breaking the law on the payroll of a SANCTIONED ENEMY STATE
of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA
as a 
Campaigner/advisor for TRUMP, as a foreign policy advisor for TRUMP, as
National Security Advisor, a damned important position with an office right next to the president in the white house..
AT THE Innauguration, FLYNN was finalizing an agreement for a TRUMP HOTEL IN MOSCOW....
Remember TRUMPS CLAIMS he had no deals, no financial arrangmentes, no nothing with RUSSIA?????

**
Hillary Clinton
was careless, foolish, & arrogant, but she did not deliberately aid any foreign power!
**
Michael Flynn
Directly acted-on-behalf of a foreign nation, with a history of hostility toward the United States, & accepted a great deal of money in payment for that service. 
.
It was definitively  illegal, & comes very, very close to the definition of treason."
"Rick Kooi","2019-02-23T20:21:54Z","WASHINGTON/MOSCOW
Just two years after working to put Donald Trump in the White House, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is now getting help from Trump to achieve foreign policy objectives that Russia has sought for years.
.
(Like Hegemony from IRAN/IRAQ, Yemen, Syria, some Afghanistan & Pakistan provinces.)
1.
Trump has loudly criticized the NATO military alliance as unduly burdensome for the United States. 
HE Even Suggested that  Defending NATO MEMBER (--paid Up--)Montenegro would hardly be worth World War III.  
.
Sounds like Neville Chamberlain SELLING OUT Czechoslovakia...and announcing PEACE IN OUR TIME!

TRUMP knew when he made that statement...that Bloody Putin had stationed the Newest Troops and TANKS along those Eastern European Borders!
2.
He has started a trade war with many of those same allies. 
.
(--Japan & the European Union formed the world's LARGEST Free Trade Zone, completely without the USA--)
.
( Remember the Good Old Day when the US was leader of the world and Ally of the European Union & Japan)
3.
And on his way to the G-7 summit of industrialized democracies Friday morning, he suggested that those nations re-admit Russia to the gathering ( ? ) even though BLOODY Russia continues to occupy part of Ukraine
 AND
Occupies all of the Crimea, 
Occupies a chunk of Georgia,
has never been punished for Genocide in Chechnya,
the reason it was expelled from the group in the first place.
.
‚ÄúIf this were a screenplay,  Hollywood would have thrown it out as too ridiculous,‚Äù said Tom Nichols, a Russia expert at the Naval War College.
.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anybody who thinks this is a good idea.‚Äù
.
‚Äú Today crystallizes precisely why Putin was so eager to see Trump elected ! ‚Äù  
said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and the National Security Council spokesman.

‚ÄúFor Putin, 
this is return on his investment, & it‚Äôs safe to say that his investment has paid off beyond even wildest dreams!‚Äù
.
HELL'S BELLS,  
A Russian ARMED and LED mercenary army HAS ATTACKED US TROOPS in Syria a few months ago. 
For 3 (three) days, our troops waited for Our Commander in Chief to authorize the right to self defense ! 
For 3 Days, our Commander in Chief failed to answer !
.
OUR troops finally had to rely on OBAMA ERA standing orders, 
in order to defend themselves and counter attack.
.
** Our President Trump SAID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN ATTACK !
*** Our President Trump DID  NOTHING about this RUSSIAN ATTACK !
but
he held SECRET meetings with PUTIN
he invited Putin to Washington, DC
he believed Putin's STRONG Denial that he MEDDLED with the US election
he was invited BACK to Moscow
He asked that Russia be readmitted to the G8, despite having attacked the US.
.
He kissed the ARS of the RUSSIAN BEAR by GRABBING DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY and ordered US troops out of Syria.

After ALL of those Press Releases from Oil & Coal P.R. departments in the 1970's
proclaiming a mini ice age was around the corner !

----BOTH having predicted that Global Warming would End around 2000,
and then again...it would end with the solar minimum of 2007-2009
and then again...it would end around 2015
and NOW WE HAVE PREDICTIONS in the media of a 
GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM ushering in a mini ice age...what again?

HOWEVER 
‚Äî THEY reported/admitted  just a few months ago, that UAH data NOW confirms
an
‚Äú UPWARD Global climate temperature trend SINCE Nov.16, 1978  
-------->40 years ago !

THAT amounts to a rate of  1.4C / 100 years.
NOTE, 
temps. HAD risen  0.85 to 1.15C over the last century.
SO 
THIS NEW CHRISTY RATE  1.4C / 100 years is a 20%+ increase in the rate of warming!
.
Compare that to Geological History of Temperature Changes:
a life threateningly rapid increase in historic temps averaged  1C in 7500 years which Led to large specie Die-Offs.

1.4 C  by humans per 100 yrs
1.0 C  historical norm 7500 yrs

Electromagnetic radiation includes Infrared Radiation (IR) and visible light. Both pass thru the atmosphere and are absorbed by the surface of the Earth and converted to kinetic energy (heat). This heat is emitted back outward as thermal radiation aka IR. A significant amount of this IR is reabsorbed by the denser atmospheric gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etcetera. This excites their molecular structure and the resulting kinetic energy re-emits IR. Life on Earth is made possible by the capturing of enough IR to keep the biosphere warm enough to sustain life. As the heavier molecules in the atmosphere increase, the amount of IR also increases.

US NEWS & WORLD REPORT

""....At Taxpayers for Common Sense, we recently analyzed the federal income taxes paid over the last five years by some of the largest U.S.-based oil and gas companies. What we found surprised us. 
We set out to document the federal tax rate of oil and gas industry leaders because we knew the claim made by the American Petroleum Institute ‚Äì that the industry pays an income tax rate of 44.3 percent ‚Äì is misleading. The claim is misleading because the institute uses it in the context of reforming the federal tax code, but the figure includes all foreign, state and local taxes, as well as federal. When we looked at the financial statements of 20 of the largest oil and gas companies, we found this group paid an average federal tax rate of 24 percent on its U.S. income. 
This was not surprising. It is no secret the federal tax code is riddled with broad exceptions and deductions allowing many industries to pay much less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate. In fact, one of the goals of tax reform is to lower the overall corporate rate by removing the system of distortive tax preferences that require companies to change their behavior in order to qualify. 
.
What was surprising, though, was the extent to which these companies were able to delay or defer the payment of the federal taxes they accrued. Most of the companies in our study deferred more than they actually paid. When the deferred taxes are subtracted from the amount 
these 20 companies owe, their average ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù tax rate drops to 
11.7 percent. The independent oil and gas companies in the bottom half of our list, excluding the ones that recorded losses for the period, deferred almost all of the federal income taxes they accrued during the last five years, reporting an average current tax rate of 
just 3.7 percent. ..."""

Do you have direct evidence humans never existed during the time when co2 levels were higher? And just because humans, may not, have evolved yet, life has been on earth since the beginning of earth's creation. 4.54 billion years ago earth was created, earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago. There is evidence that life began much earlier.

You say goldilocks for humans, where does this even come from? You just say things that try to match what you claim, but when in reality, it's just words and has no basis in reality. Air vs co2, co2 is 0.006% of our current atmosphere. 6% is when humans die, due to the partial pressure of co2 inside the body and not able to exhale it from the body. 0.006%- 6%, is a huge range, how do you arbitrary say 0.006% is goldilocks for earth and humans, if it's been higher before and life exist.

Co2 is not an issue with global warming. The ocean warms, due to temperature, and with the hotter water temps, more co2 cannot dissolve in the oceans and hence, we see the reason, hotter temps show higher co2 levels, this is only half true. Because the oceans got hotter, there is more co2 in the atmosphere, see the issue with there thinking. It's not co2 causing the warming, it's the warming rising co2 levels. Grow more trees to absorb the co2."

I'm even fine with the sea actually rising 20 feet. Sure, a huge chunk of humans might die, but that's not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. There will be enough left to preserve civilization and that's all that really matters long term. I mean, as individuals, we are all gonna die eventually, so whatever.

The problem really lies in a more significant increase due to potential run away reactions, which will in turn kill plant and animals, thus depriving us of food and finally kill all but a few of us. That is the real problem. The chance of something this is extreme is pretty slim. It's probably not much higher than the chance of apocalypse by epidemic or by meteor. Still, it's a gamble and we can't afford to lose it, not until we can colonize some other rock. The real question therefore, is whether we should be take the gamble given the low chance of losing.

Of course, if you are squeamish and can't deal with couple hundred millions or even billions dying, then you stand a greater chance of losing. Still might not be very big, but significantly larger than humanity being wiped out."

FACT!
"" TONY HELLER  (aka  Steven Goddard)  TESTIFIED that temperatures had fallen a remarkable 1.2C""
------------
Tony Heller‚Äôs findings were charted on a graph posted on the website realclimatescience.com. 
A biographical sketch on the International Conferences on Climate Change website created by the 
Heartland Institute 
notes that Heller ‚Äúhas spent much of the past seven years studying the history of extreme weather, 
as well as the history and methodology behind the reported NOAA/NASA temperature record.‚Äù 
FACT!
(( ----TONY HELLER aka Steven Goddard is an electrical Engineer &
has never studied climate & never reported or published any actual research----))

""While this latest report may come as a surprise to many people, 
longtime readers of The New American will not be among them. 
Our publication has published numerous reports over the past several years 
offering evidence that not only are periods of global warming more likely to be 
the result of natural cyclical changes than human activity, 
but that the warming process has reversed itself and 
our Earth actually have entered a cooling period.""

....find it on a legit sources of news.  Daily Caller & Breitbart are PAID to spout an ideological point of view & NO OTHER!

Yes, follow the money.

Coal & OIL & GAS suck 6.5% of the world's entire gross domestic Product just in the form of SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORTS....not including profits !  

THAT IS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS split between a few thousand family oligarchs.

THAT 6.5% compares to under 1% just 18 years ago.

Paul Ryan whined in August of 2016, that by years end, the US would set a record of $1 TRILLION
in SUPPORTS & SUBSIDIES & Sweet Heart Tax deals and Wage Supports & even in foreign aid designed to reimburse foreign nations for subsidies they pay our profitable industries...

and they have had their hands out since 1918!

There were periods between 1000 and 2000 AD that had a full 3 degree C differential, and you are claiming ""1.0 historical norms"".  Which way, ""Rich"", up or down, considering that the temperature has gone up and down at a greater differential 6 separate centuries in that same time period I stated above.  Al Gore, the single most quoted supporter of the failed ""human caused climate change"" there is, stated that the polar ice caps would be gone by 2014, and that NYC would be underwater.

It contributes to climate change, habitat loss, extinction and pollution. It leads to energy, water and food shortages, mass migration, conflict and poverty. I also believe that the melting of continental ice caps that began 20,000 years ago, is simply still upon us."

Another example is whether you will live if you jump out of a plane without a parachute now the last ten thousand times it happened nobody survived but I can show you one instance where a person did survive now you might be that person but it is extremely likely you will die instead similarly it is extremely likely that global warming is caused by humans is what the scientists are saying so are you still ready to jump out of the plane without a parachute ...

"Anthony Morris","2018-11-25T18:03:49Z","@Harsh Sampat This 97% boast has already been discredited. Also 20,000 years ago the entire northern hemisphere was covered in ice. Something caused the planet to warm and the ice has been melting ever since. Why won't 97% of scientists explain that. I believe humans are contributing to climate change. I just believe in a pragmatic solution. I don't believe in the alarmist rhetoric. I commend you for the things that you have done. You are walking the walk and not just preaching. If I have a child I've just doubled my carbon foot print. With each child this grows exponentially. Especially if they have children.

It is interesting you bring up "" Flat Earthers"". The typical pejorative used by global warmers against anyone who sees things differently. Climate change is a money maker for the few elite. It is not a "" settled science."" I am far from alone in this opinion. If you believe weather changes in earth are due to mankind, have at it. I and many others do not agree with that premise.

Later first Frost's
Earlier last Frost's
A reduction in fuels/energy used for heat
A small increase in energy used for cooling
Increased harvests
Increases in livestock production. 
More people die from cold than heat
Lots more wildlife dies from cold than heat

The Great Barrier Reef has dead areas from several different causes. 
Heat is not a major factor
Silt is
Chemicals are the number one reason for certain large areas dieing off. Mostly from run off from Australia. 
The nutrients increase algee growth and algee chokes coral. 
Coral grows very slowly. Mechanical damage from ships, anchors, recreational divers, etc can take decades to replace what can be destroyed in an hour. 

Coral reefs have a life cycle. As coral reefs grow, the Coral's consume the plankton at an ever  increasing rate, until there is no longer enough to feed the reef. At this point all, or at least large portions of the reef die. This is natural, and not caused by man. In the '70's coral die offs in the Great Barrier Reef we're being blamed on Global Cooling. Today it's Global Warming.

 The coral reefs get used as a means to generate emotional feelings for political gain. 
Yes I am an oceanographer. Started back at n '79. Stop using climate like it's something we can control. We can't. Humans only produce 0.002% of the CO2. Nature produces the rest. Warming and cooling are a side effect of the Sun's activity. We can not control it."

Do you study EOSDIS Worldview images as well?  If you do even a tiny bit of viewing the above images you'll realize our weather IS manipulated.  Please, please tale time to view 1PacificRedwood videos. I've been capturing sky pics for about 10 years now...you should look up and realize the crap in our skies and the effects of it.  Best look up D.E.W. too and see how it was used in the 2018 SoCal fires...
On another topic...did you ever notice that President Obama is a stutterer?  I was a pretty serious stutterer for a number of years and at 70 plus my degree is Speech Path and Audiology i can hear the patterns quickly in a person's speech.  I noticed his pattern the very first time he appeared on the national scene.  I was actually in another room listening to the intro and when he spoke and I thought holy cow; he's a stutterer and raced in to see with my eyes as well.  
I have also noticed how cannabis lessens stuttering...but I digress.  
Watch some 1PRs!!!!!  please.  You'll be in good company; he has  'Global warnings' attached to his videos and his counts are all manipulated.  Truth is hard to swallow for so many people who really like to control others more than themselves."

Al Gore is the first Climate Change Billionaire 
The idea of man-made CO2 the sole cause of Global Warming is absurd and scientifically baseless. There are so many factors which influence the changing of climate. The Sun and Water vapour are 2 of the biggest factors. Only 2% of gas in the atmosphere is Greenhouse gasses. Out of that 2%, only 4% is Co2, and 1% Methane, the rest (95%) is Water vapour from the ocean. If you do the math, Co2 only account for 0.04% of the total atmosphere. It is so tiny and insignificant factor in Climate. Even then, most of Co2 are produced by Volcanoes and UNDERWATER Volcanoes. Do you know that 80% of volcanoes are underwater!? Planet Earth's surface is 70% water¬†

The study openly demonstrated they fudged the numbers using a variety of bookkeeping tricks, including counting studies that took NO POSITION as studies that supported anthropogenic global warming. Table 3 of the Cook study clearly admits that only 32.6% of the studies endorse the ""consensus view""!

Of that, about 74% only ""implicitly"" (rather than explicitly) endorse the consensus view. Meaning, the real number of scientific studies that EXPLICITLY endorse the ""consensus view"" that humans caused climate change is...wait for it...about 8.6%!

PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE ME! Read that study and do the math yourself and look at Table 3 of the Cook study.

"Kenny Noble","2018-11-01T21:13:18Z","You can layer up in the cold as much as you'd like. You can't (lawfully) strip down much further than shorts, tank and flip-flops. We should be proactive in preventing the heat from rising further, even if it's just to take the time many of the big businesses/polluters and the consumers/polluters need to change their ways, or to save the great great grandchildren from excessive heat. If we don't get on it, what generation will? I don't think underestimation or procrastination in the face of this gradually increasing threat is the answer. I do think that it should be 1 of many problems that need to be fixed. I'm not at all advocating we abandon more pressing matters. We have big, under-worked/distracted government, and a large, resourceful country capable of doing more than it is.  Let's use that to MULTITASK and try to actually reach the potential we have. Maybe don't issue subsidies to the rich. Maybe issue subsidies to the poor, instead. We tried the carrot with big businesses like auto manufacturers and energy producers. Unfortunately, they used that money either for sub-par products or to put it right back into business as usual. It's time for the stick. There are distribution of noxious substance laws already on the books. What we need is enforcement of those laws, adoption of those laws into the US Code, and therefore tougher sentencing upon conviction. Those laws should apply 1st to businesses, then 10 years later, to consumers. I believe that most businesses and consumers, within 20 years of the passing of laws like that, would comply and that we'd see a slight drop in global temperature within 10 years after both sets of laws are passed. If not, then those laws could and should be repealed. I do believe those laws would work. Besides, it's about time for the government to back up those words about climate change with action, anyway. If not, they should just knock it off, repeal all ""Green Tyranny"" laws and abolish the seemingly useless EPA and similar government organizations for much-needed budget cuts and freer commerce... See what happens to the global temps within 10 years after then, Mr. Stossel."

Data shows the climate is changing.  That‚Äôs not up for debate.  That is the problem coming from the Right ‚Äì they deny it‚Äôs happening.  It is not.  It‚Äôs settled research because the data doesn‚Äôt lie.  Interpretation of data can change over time and models are never accurate, they help learn and understand impact of data, which must be refined over time, and that means conclusions change.  It‚Äôs how science works.  When politics and business take over science you no longer get science.

The real 3 questions we should focus on:  

a) is it a problem at all and if so should it be worried about?  b) should we try and fix it?  c) if we agree we should fix it how do we fix it?  

Those 3 questions aren‚Äôt being dealt with.  

You have a) it is doom heading our way!  b) we have a plan that costs money form the paris accords and anyone that doesn‚Äôt agree is a science denier and c) if you don‚Äôt agree you‚Äôre a science denier.

The problem is that most people I talk to on the right are the actual science denier.

Stop arguing with the data, instead address the 3 REAL questions.

.
-----> For Over a Century & a half,
‚ÄúThe (pro-Fossil-Fuel right-wing) narrative out there is that scientists don‚Äôt know the cause of climate change is wrong,‚Äù 
They have Claimed, ""Those scientists don't know the degree to which Human/Industrial Activity influences Climate""! 
.
That is wrong!
.
Study lead author Dr. Benjamin Santer, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said in a statement. 
.
‚ÄúWe do!‚Äù
The general mechanism is quite well understood!
.
We burn carbon-based fossil fuels. This process releases ancient stored carbon dioxide 
(and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere), 
which Resists, Traps & Redirects IR heat (which is attempting to escape to the cold of Space as a cooling effect for earth). 

There‚Äôs absolutely no doubt that the planet‚Äôs climate is getting hotter 
‚Äî decades‚Äô worth of multiple satellite & ground data clearly show 
.
(Alexander von Humboldt  coined the term and defined ' CLIMATE CHANGE ' in 1799)
(Eunice Foote's experiments, reported in Scientific American in 1856 proved Earth's Atmospheric Gases (CO2 for example) IMPACT Warming!
(Thomas Jefferson & John Adams discussed this changing climate from 1799 to 1804)
(Science established human activities were causing these Global Climate Changes in 1811)
.
There‚Äôs Now Overwhelming evidence that points to human activity as the main culprit. 

While there are natural factors that can cause an equal and even greater impact, human activity is essentially a smoking gun here:     the evidence indicates that all of this current global warming is caused by humans.

.
In this latest study, 
scientists carried out a statistical analysis of satellite climate data, identifying the anthropogenic fingerprints in climate change. 
.
The analysis showed that humans are causing climate change to a confidence level of 5 sigmas,
the gold standard of statistics ‚Äî which translates a 99.9999% certainty. 

.
In other words, 
there‚Äôs only a one-in-a-million chance that the pattern of atmospheric heating is not the result of human activity.
.
Science doesn‚Äôt really ever eliminate uncertainty ‚Äî it just reduces it, and when the uncertainty reaches very low levels, then that‚Äôs essentially a scientific certainty.
This isn‚Äôt the first study to strongly conclude that humans are causing climate change

Christianity is the only Religion of TRUTH. In Deuteronomy 28, Almighty God YAHWEH, told Moses that He would Bless the Nations by making it RAIN (WATER), but, Israel would have to worship the True Living God only, and keep His Commands, and not worship any other false gods (small letter 'g'). PLEASE READ DEUTERONOMY 28.All Scientists in CERN Geneva say that the most abundant Element in the World is Hydrogen (God Particle). Hydrogen 2 Oxygen = WATER... WATER= LIFE. Saint Peter said 2000 years ago in 2 Peter 3 Verse 5 in The Holy Bible: They purposely ignore the fact that long ago God gave a command, and the heavens and the earth were created. The earth was formed out of WATER (Hydrogen/God Particle) and by WATER (HOLY SPIRIT). 
The Holy Bible John 19 Verse 34: *One of the soldiers, however, plunged his spear into JESUS's side, and at once BLOOD and WATER (HOLY SPIRIT/GOD PARTICLE) poured out.*

1 John 5. The Witness about JESUS Christ.
JESUS Christ is the one who came with the WATER (HOLY SPIRIT) of His Baptism and the BLOOD of His death. He came not only with the WATER, but both the WATER and the BLOOD. And the Spirit himself testifies that this is true, because the Spirit is TRUTH. There are three witnesses; the SPIRIT, the WATER, and the BLOOD; and all three give the same testimony.

God Bless! The manna in the DESERT was the Holy Eucharist, the Body of Christ. Everything begins and ends at the CROSS.

There is many places in The Holy Bible where we can compare Almighty God YAHWEH to Our Lord JESUS Christ. The Jews must just read Psalm 22, Psalm 110, Isaiah 52 and 53 and Jeremiah 31 Verses 31 to 35, and the Jews will see the similarity.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////The Holy Bible is TRUTH.
1) Genesis 1 Verses 1 and 2: In the beginning, when God created the Universe, the Earth was formless and desolate. The raging ocean (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) that covered everything was engulfed in total darkness, and the Power of God (HOLY SPIRIT) was moving over the WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE). When Scientists look for LIFE on other Planets, they look for WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE).
*John 19 Verse 34: One of the soldiers, however, plunged his spear into JESUS' side, and at once BLOOD and WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) poured out.*
2000 years ago Saint Peter said in 2 Peter 3 Verse 5: They purposely ignore the fact that long ago God gave a command, and the Heavens and Earth were created. THE EARTH WAS FORMED OUT OF WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) AND BY WATER (HOLY SPIRIT of the FATHER YAHWEH).
2) Genesis 3 Verse 8: That evening, Adam and Eve heard the Lord God *WALKING* (God has LEGS) in the Garden, and they hid from Him among the trees. But the Lord God *CALLED OUT* (God has a MOUTH and a VOICE) to the man, ""Where are you?"" (God was *LOOKING* for Adam and Eve, so God has EYES).                                                                                                             Genesis 18 Verse 1 and 2: The Lord (1) appeared to Abraham at the sacred trees of Mamre. As Abraham was sitting at the entrance of his tent during the hottest part of the day, he looked up and saw *THREE MEN STANDING THERE*(3).
Genesis 28 Verses 12 and 13: Jacob dreamt that he saw a stairway reaching from Earth to Heaven, with angels going up and coming down on it. And there was the Lord *STANDING* (God has FEET) beside him. ""I AM the Lord, the God of Abraham and Isaac.""
Genesis 32 Verse 30: Jacob said, ""I have *SEEN* God face to face (God has a FACE), and I am still alive.""

Isaiah 7 Verse 14: Well, then, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: a young woman (Virgin) who is pregnant will have a Son and will Name Him 'Immanuel' (God with Us). Our Lord JESUS Christ is God with Us.

Zachariah 10 Verse 1: Ask the Lord for RAIN (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) in the spring of the year. It is the Lord who sends RAIN CLOUDS and SHOWERS (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE), making the fields green for everyone.
Zachariah 14 Verse 17: If any nation refuses to go and worship the Lord Almighty as KING, then RAIN (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) will not fall on their land."

Only three things have been established: (1) the clear evidence that, yes, the climate is changing; (2) the hypothesis that climate change is caused primarily by human activity; and (3) a broad ‚Äì indeed overwhelming ‚Äì consensus among scientists worldwide that the hypothesis is valid, and a consequent spillover of that consensus into the general public. Nothing about these facts adds up to science. 
     What turns a hypothesis into science is not widespread belief but rather the scientific method. What's required by the scientific method is a long narrative of data acquired through ongoing experiments out in the real world, out in the field, out in nature in all its dynamism and unpredictability. That's how all hypotheses in the past have been conclusively corroborated (or ""proven,"" to use the layman's term), whether we're talking about the theory of gravity, the theory of evolution or the theory of mass-energy equivalency. 
     In the case of the anthropogenic-climate-change hypothesis, most data has been acquired not out in the field but rather in a virtual version of nature created in computers, with all of their modeling and simulation capacity. What emerges is that the primary reason a state of science hasn't yet been achieved is that scientists have in general approached their professional work not as scientists but rather as high-powered, government-funded video-game designers. It's not reasonable to expect the general public, with its general lack of scientific education, to realize that scientists have been committing malpractice on climate change for years, but that's the reality. And that's why as yet there's no science. Which, again, is why there are skeptics."

""But why should we turn our lives upside down based on bad models?"".  They aren't bad models.  And we don't have to ""turn our lives upside down"", we need to adjust how we obtain energy and shift it away from fossil fuels to renewable resources.  That isn't turning our lives upside down.  

""We don't really care whether it warms a degree in the next sixty years...life expectancy doubled""  ""A few degrees warming might be good"" ""Many more people die from cold"".  We aren't worrying about a slight increase in mean temperature directly killing people.  The change in temperature, even at that scale, destroys our ECOSYSTEMS.  We aren't worried about people dying from the increased temperature, we are worried about people starving to death because of a tremendous lack of resources brought on from the mega-droughts that will affect the Middle-East and American Southwest, not to mention the impending resource wars.  

There is no ""fear-mongering"" with climate change.  It is happening, and it will cause problems.  ""there is no agreement as to whether warming is dangerous or not"".  Yes there is.   There are countless ways in which it will negatively impact us.  Melting ice caps and thermal expansion will raise the oceans.  This is a fact.  Ocean acidification , extreme weather, and largely decreased crop yields are just a few more examples.  

At the end of the day, you people can deny it all you want.  You'll die before the real problems start, so it's okay if you want to be self centered and choose not to do something about it and actually provide for the race you belong to.  Even if climate change was a ""hoax"" as deniers like to call it, it doesn't change the fact that trying to prevent isn't as destructive as you all believe.  Transitioning to renewable sources will not cause a collapse in society.  It is objectively better to run a society on renewable resources than fossil fuels.  Objectively.  ""We don't have endless money, if we want to help people we ought to do what really helps"".  Ya, we have money.  If we have the money to drop our military into foreign countries and blow them sky high, then I assure you we have the money to do something about climate change.  If we have the money to afford luxuries, then I assure you we have the money to do something about climate change.  If we have the money to subsidize oil companies, then I assure you we have the money to do the same for renewable energy companies (which we do, but it is hardly enough).  

It all comes down to the fact that fossil fuel companies are organizations that will do everything in their power to not only stay alive, but thrive in terms of maximizing profit in every way possible.  Unfortunately, that enormous power ends up controlling those whose duty it is to protect our society and world.  Instead of fulfilling their duty, they instead opt to spread lies and misinformation to influence public opinion and public policy so that it furthers the goal of these organizations.  Nearly every climate change denier is a denier because of this.  They are either public figures that are payed by these companies, or individual citizens that have fed into the deceit spread by those public figures.  They are not deniers because they searched far and wide for the truth by reading over peer-reviewed studies, but instead because they heard their local congressmen say there is nothing to worry about.  If they searched deeply for the truth in this matter by looking at peer-reviewed studies, then they would eventually find that truth.  That truth being that climate change is real, and is a real problem."

"Bradley Holdner","2018-09-13T22:47:53Z","The real enemy...

The IPCC was created in 1988 largely due to the efforts of Maurice Strong, a billionaire and self-confessed socialist, as part of a larger campaign to justify giving the United Nations the authority to tax businesses in developed countries and redistribute trillions of dollars a year to developing nations. Strong had previously succeeded in bringing about the creation of the UN Environment Programme in 1972 and served as its first executive director. The IPCC is a joint project of that entity and the World Meteorological Organization.

(Strong was subsequently implicated in corruption surrounding the UN‚Äôs Oil-for-Food-Program and has resigned from his UN positions. According to John Izzard writing for the Australian publication Quadrant Online, <1> ‚ÄúFollowing his exposure for bribery and corruption in the UN‚Äôs Oil-for-Food scandal Maurice Strong was stripped of many of his 53 international awards and honours he had collected during his lifetime working in dual role of arch conservationist and ruthless businessman.‚Äù<1>)

Strong and his allies at the UN gave the IPCC a very narrow brief by defining climate change in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 1.2, as ‚Äúa change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.‚Äù IPCC‚Äôs mandate is not to study climate change ‚Äúin the round,‚Äù or to look at natural as well as man-made influences on climate. It is to specifically find and report a human impact on climate, and thereby make a scientific case for the adoption of national and international policies that would supposedly reduce that impact.

The IPCC is also designed to put political leaders and bureaucrats rather than scientists in control of the research project. It is a membership organization composed of governments, not scientists. The governments that created the IPCC fund it, staff it, select the scientists who get to participate, and revise and rewrite the reports after the scientists have concluded their work. Obviously, this is not how a real scientific organization operates.

The IPCC‚Äôs first report, released in 1990, admitted that observed climate change was probably due to natural rather than human causes. However, every report since then has claimed with rising certainty that there is a ‚Äúdiscernable human impact‚Äù on the climate and that steps must be taken to avoid a global climate crisis. There is ample evidence that this level of alarmism and asserted confidence is fueled by political considerations rather than actual science.

For example, in 1996, Dr. Frederick Seitz, one of the world‚Äôs most prominent and respected physicists, wrote in the Wall Street Journal: <2>‚ÄúIn my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community, including service as president of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process than the events that led to this IPCC report.‚Äù

Numerous authors (see here, here, and here)<3> have observed a growing disconnect between the ‚ÄúSummaries for Policymakers,‚Äù which are designed to be read and used by political leaders and the media, and the reports themselves. The former systematically remove the expressions of scientific uncertainty and alternative explanations of climate phenomena that were abundantly present in the first three reports, with the obvious intention of misrepresenting the science and fueling unnecessary alarm. By the fourth and fifth assessment reports, even the underlying reports were being purged of ideas and evidence that contradicted the IPCC‚Äôs political agenda.

In 2009, a hacker or whistle blower made available on the Internet a collection of email exchanges among leading authors and contributors to the IPCC reports. The ensuing scandal, called Climategate, <4> exposed efforts by IPCC authors to withhold data from independent scholars and attempt to prevent peer-reviewed journals from publishing research that undermined or questioned their own work. In 2011 <5> the hacker or whistle blower released a second batch of emails that made even more clear that the IPCC process was broken."

"moorek1967","2018-09-08T17:50:23Z","Here is the problem with ""global temperature recording"", when the US is hot in the summer, it is cold and snowy in Australia and New Zealand. Some people don't get the idea that the northern and southern hemispheres have different and opposite climates. So when they say ""global records"", where exactly are they taking the temperatures at?

I think that most young people just don't know that simple little fact and assume what scientists are telling them. If you take the temperature today in Indiana and compare it with Southern California, Brazil and Australia, you will find that we do not have the same temps. So to claim some kind of global rise in temperatures without considering the seasons are not the same, is naive.

And here is another one, England has a warmer climate than most of the northern United States, even though they are at a higher latitude. The driving ocean currents bring warm water to them. So we in Indiana can have -40 degrees F in winter, whereas England can have 35 degrees F on the same day.

So exactly why are they continually pulling these numbers to mislead people about ""rises in global temperatures"" when the globe does not even have consistent temps to begin with? If it is hot in one place, it will be cool in another place, and never too much more than the previous year season. To say ""this is the hottest summer on record"", yes, maybe for one place but certainly not for all places. I have known summers that were very hot and summers that were very cool. 

""Rising global temperatures"" are myths based on one thing, money. Today, Indiana is 65 degrees F, last year at this time we were very much warmer, but we have had times of cooler temps in July, long before this so-called ""Climate change science"". The climate changes every season in every part of the world. But you can't convince ignorant children today of that fact because they believe ""97% of scientists"" are telling them the truth when they themselves can just go look at old newspapers and see the daily temperatures for anywhere in the world and then they will know that some years are warmer and some years are cooler.

But cities are warmer than the countryside, and cities on rivers east are warmer than cities to the west on the same rivers."

"1967davethewave","2018-10-01T21:48:09Z","I agree that lack of¬†water vapor is the reason why Mar's atmosphere is so cold. But you if you are making the statement that 4/110ths of 1% of the gas in the earth's atmosphere has anything to do with the regulation of the earth's temperature I would disagree. In a laboratory scientists can show that CO2 holds heat in. But those aren't natural occurrences of CO2 and if CO2 was a really efficient greenhouse gas then even Mars with it's much thinner atmosphere but much, much larger concentration of CO2 gases should be warmer and more temperate. I did misspeak though and you are right, I should have said that there is no agreement that CO2 is causing the temperature to warm on earth, not that it can't cause¬†warming. There is a very interesting article published in National Geographic in 2005 that showed the warming of the planet was consistent over a specified time that it was studied from 1985 to 2000. But this study was of Mars and it showed Mars warming the exact same amount as the Earth during the same period. I take this to mean that the Earth is warming, or at least during the period it was studied and it I also take it to mean that it is being caused by an outside force. Most likely the Sun. But before we jump to any conclusions and blame anything I would submit that there needs to be a totally independent study done by an equal number of scientists that both support and refute that man has a hand in global warming. And that the facts be presented for all to see impartially. My biggest problem is that there is almost no settled science as even great minds like Einstein are questioned again and again by¬†current scientists as new information becomes available. To say anything is settled, except maybe the earth being round, is the exact opposite of what good scientific research is, and I just don't see the evidence to support the case for man made global warming. Human's may cause many other environmental problems but just the huge scale of the atmosphere and it's incredibly dynamic nature, I think, makes it unlikely that we can cause any great harm to it."
"Franz Maier","2018-09-29T15:24:42Z","There is absolute agreement that CO2 causes warming. It is basic physics.
Historically, warming often released CO2 into the atmosphere. This does not mean CO2 cannot cause warming. It is in fact a positive feedback loop.
The mass of the atmosphere of Mars is about 1/200 of that of the Earth and there is much less water vapor, causing lower temperatures."

"Rick Kooi","2022-05-06T15:03:55Z","You have missed the historical FACTS! 
You have missed the Deep State! 
You have missed the Globalist Bankers hand-in-hand with the Fossil Fuel  Deep State. 
1. 
The massive redistribution of wealth  and PURE POLITICAL POWER
(( you are blaming the SCIENTISTS, Renewable Industries, and ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT MARXISTS )) 
has been ongoing by the GLOBALIST Fossil Fuel Deep-State Energy monopoly AND their GLOBALIST BANKERS!!.  
Despite their enviable profitability
...they started getting Subsidies & Supports After several years of OVERLY generous political donations in 1918!
2.
Those Supports/Subsidies have done nothing BUT grow!
2.
BOUGHT MORE POWER. 
3.
BOUGHT MORE POLITICIANS!
3.
19 years ago, worldwide subsidies & supports to the fossil Fuel Billionaire Industrialists & dependent industries. (( and their globalist bankers )) 
had grown to 1% of the entire world's GDP...trillions of dollars.
4.
In 2016,
Paul Ryan gave a Lengthy Lamentation about the fact, that by that year's end, 
""Supports/Subsidies/Free Infra Structure Construction and Maintenance/wage supports/ Foreign Aid 
to reimburse nations for the Subsidies they are required to give OUR fossil Fuel Industries, etc. 
would REACH A MAMOUTH  ONE  (1) TRILLION DOLLARS...just in the US.
.
That same year,
5.
2016, worldwide the Globalist Fossil Fuel Deep-State and their ultra-nationalist bankers were 
SUCKING ABOUT 6 to 6.5% of world GDP.........many trillions of dollars!!  
IT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST to keep you pointing in other directions!
... at welfare, at Green Energy programs, at Illegal Immigration, 
at other peoples claim of Redistribution of wealth etc. 
Point at anything but their nefarious INTENT!
WEALTH, POWER

But if you follow the money...and all the tax breaks, Deferred Taxes
...it flows overwhelmingly toward The DEEP STATE Fossils & Their GLOBALIST Bankers."

"Canned Laughter","2018-09-06T20:11:57Z","Whenever research is done, only those studies where findings show a positive correlation are published.  The rest (though there might be many) are forgotten about or dismissed.  And in a world where grants are everything (with regards to research money), ""global warming"" is a hot topic (no pun intended).  I don't think most researchers are deliberately dishonest but, again, when it is the difference between ""publish or perish"", many will chose to ""hedge their bets.""  And, as I already said, those studies which don't report global warming or climate change are quickly swept under the rug.  You tell me there won't be some ""fudging"" going on.  I remember when I was in high school (more years ago than I care to think about), scientists warned us that we were about to enter another ice-age.  Or some did and that's what the journalists jumped on.  Is it any different now?

And anyhow, do we REALLY want to get the government to get involved?!   I don't think so.  They'll spend a hundred taxpayer dollars to ""save"" one dollar.  Carbon points?  Phooey!"

I am from the Netherlands and the village where my parents live is 6 feet below sea level. For us, this is a problem, and it is a problem that we can only tackle if we work together. For us, this is a problem of national importance, and it is a matter of course that the state is involved in addressing it.

Aren't we now smart enough to develop solar, geothermal, tidal, nuclear, etc. etc.?  We CAN do away with carbon fuels.  So why are we not?  Because it is the big energy corporations (oil & coal predominately), not a small insignificant number of climate scientist, that control the nation's energy agenda.  Energy corporations DO NOT want you to have cheap, clean, and abundant energy.  They want you to pay top dollar and for you to be their bitch!  Oil and coal are not going away anytime soon.  However, we need to start NOW making the switch to nuclear and renewables and and stop the stranglehold energy companies have on America!"

"Unmannedair","2018-08-12T23:59:02Z","As a scientist, it saddens me to see so many people focused on the wrong questions here.  It isn't a question of climate change existing or not existing.   That definitely exists, the more pertinent question is how bad is it and what can we do?  The answers to those questions are fairly straightforward and not discussed at all in any resemblance of the scientific method.  The simple answer is we don't know, and nothing.  We simply don't have the data to make accurate long term predictions, and the only thing that might change the status quo, if it is bad, is a complete change in global cultural usage of resources.  The first problem will fix itself with time, but the second problem is where the circus begins.  Half the solutions people are selling is snake oil, and the other half is wishful thinking based on misinformation.  Electric cars are not greener, and wind power is even more destructive than hydroelectric power.  Don't even get me started on all these wasteful idiotic recycling programs.  I'm all for being ecologically responsible, but let's not kid ourselves huh. Drinking straws for example are not even close to being a serious problem.  All the people that get sick from reusing a dirty steel straw are going to needlessly visit a hospital which are epic sources of waste flow.  Most of us waste all kinds of resources around us simply because we don't think about it as being a type of waste.    If there is a problem, then that is the real problem."
"Roger Surf","2018-08-12T21:16:06Z","Here is a summary of the correct and real scientific facts. 

Trust this helps:

Please bear mind, that in order to reduce the temperature of the world by limiting or abolishing the production of CO2, is a horrendously expensive task world wide.

This attempt in itself, regardless of what the climate is doing, can only lead to disastrous rises in the cost of energy which in turn will lead to economic collapse of world economies along with of course disastrous effects on the world populace.
 (Yup I majored in economics - class of 1981 - and for me this is easy to see). 

You see, our economies are based on fossil energy, Coal, Gas and Oil etc and unless equally or less expensive substitutes are found, without these things, most of us will starve and/or freeze to death.

But perhaps, as is postulating on this site, if we are not to to ruin the planet, maybe the above cost will be worthwhile?

<b>So at the very least, trying to cool the planet is a very serious thing to attempt and I am sure that you would agree that  we should not go down this road unless we have absolute proof that humans are warming the planet and that the predictions we are hearing from some sources are scientifically confirmed</b>

Fortunately there is a scientific method which  allows us to decide whether the above is true or not.

If you read Karl Popper and  if you wish to take it even further, William of Ockham,  you can find the basis of the scientific disproof of a hypothesis.

This quick video may help.
Richard Feynman on disproving a hypothesis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6-x0modwY

And Dr Roy Spencer Graph showing Models and empirical measurements.
http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/CMIP5-73-models-vs-obs-20N-20S-MT.png

(The accompanying commentary for the above can be found on Dr Spencer's website archive Blogs June 2013)

This is a good example of Popper's disproval of a hypothesis. In this case the models are the hypothesis', (or law as Feynman describes them) and the actual temperature measurements, some of which are satellites, represent the empirical measurements.

<b> Therefore it is very obvious that the models fall under Feynman's rejection. There is therefore no scientific evidence that the earth is warming, (or cooling),  other than what has already been observed throughout history.</b>

Unfortunately, governments like excuses to issue new laws. As most governments nowadays, (including that of New Zealand), are sliding steadily to the left, this gives them an excuse to issue more laws and regulations of the sort which we must obey at the cost of trading a little of our freedom and democracy. We see this happening in our society at this very moment as common law is replaced with regulative legislation in most sectors. Common law traditionally is/was at arms length from governments. Regulations by legislation are not.

So please take the time to study these things. If you are a skeptic, (and so should everyone), please use the facts above if you are challenged by some greenie.

This is how science works and the above is the correct scientific conclusion.

Cheers

Roger"

One cause for the escalation of extreme weather events is simple...less trees in the tropics each year....less to absorb the suns radiation = tropical warming (NOT GLOBAL WARMING!). Higher temperature around the tropics = more moisture evaporated from the oceans producing much warmer denser and increased cloud production (hence more flooding in tropics where tree cover is reduced).....then more and denser ‚Äòtropical rainforest clouds‚Äô carrying more moisture escape the tropics as intense heat on cleared land creates lift to allow these clouds to escape the tropics on trade winds...hence cooling effect away from the tropics as cloud cover increases and increased rain and snow fall away from the tropics, whilst extra cloud cover also traps the extra heat travelling up from the tropics.....Less trees in the tropics each year = less biomass to sequester the CO2‚Äô....As the ocean warms, the warmer seas travel north to the Arctic and south to the Antarctic...as warmer air from the tropics travels north and south.... air is warmer in the Arctic and in the Antarctic....simples!‚Äô The warmer air and seas distorts the position of the jet stream pushing it north towards west Canada and north towards the UK but there is a counteractive force pushing the jet stream south at these points as a result of the increase in cloud cover escaping the Tropics which cools some areas of the ocean through reduced radiation from the sun.

Then, they blame their alleged archenemies, patriarchy/capitalism/whites, for the problems they chose to ignore.

The totalitarian socialist states of the twentieth century employed the same strategy. The NAZIs argued the apocalypse of the Germanic people, and claimed that everyone was conspiring to oppress them. The Communist Russians argued their survival depended on social re-engineering: the five-year plan, and claimed that the fascists and nationalists were existential threats. There are many other examples. Eric Blair's Animal Farm is a fairy tale of this pattern in modern politics and history. The West is in the Old Major chapters right now. I doubt we have learned anything. My generation, the millennials, are the most dogmatic, historically illiterate generation in American history, and our parent's generation let us be indoctrinated by state schools. There is essentially little hope that we will avoid the Snowball Revolution.

Short lesson in semantics: public vs state schools.

Public is a word we use for state-controlled institutions in a politically plural state. State is a word we use for state-controlled institutions in a one-party state. In both cases, institutions not controlled privately are controlled by the state, with some distinction in autonomy.

Our public institutions are overwhelming populated by constituents of one party. That same party is hellbent on pigeonholing all objectionable opposition into the narrative of the evil Republican party. Interesting enough, the Star Wars chronology has Lord Vader and the Emperor characterize the Republic as evil to justify one-party rule. The parallels are scary if you think critically. Beware the salvific message offered by Snowball and Napoleon. They're anti-Christs inducing mass delusion via mythological vision. The dreams of socialism are the true opiates of the masses."

"Tadesan","2018-05-31T16:02:43Z","There's a physicist named John Baez who advocates an outside-in approach to the subject:
Our planet is a system. It has two main sources of energy- light, and potential energy from infalling material. It has one main source of matter- infalling material. The earth emits energy in the form of light, and loses matter due to radioactive decay, scouring by the solar wind, and space exploration.

Within that framework everything must make sense.

So if we are ignoring the sunlight falling on the surface of the Earth, and we are burning coal like villains we are using more energy than we are recieving. Because the Earth is an approximate sphere its volume is finite therefore you can conclude that we will run out of energy. I am comfortable with that not being contentious and it also somehow motivates me to think about things bigger. It also let's me recognize that at it's fundamental, wind energy actually IS solar energy. And fossil fuels actually ARE solar energy. Geothermal is likely not solar but instead leftover kinetic energy and leftover radioactive energy. See, John Baez helped me be smarter!

"EF M","2018-05-18T02:50:14Z","CO2 is a greenhouse gas. That is it both absorbs and releases infrared photons. Once released, there is one chance in 23,600 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 70% of the Earth, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate the surface, instead will excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 40% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity. The present increase in temperature due to this CO2 function is approximately .9C at present. Because it takes a tremendous amount of time for the oceans to heat, it will take centuries for the Earth to reach temperature equilibrium. If we continue to inject CO2 into the atmosphere, that heating process will continue to accelerate."

The important part is that when ocean creatures die the rotting process releases a bunch of gasses which end up locked in the bottom of the ocean. If I'm remembering correctly there's a bunch of methane down there and if the ocean heats up then all that gas will come up and really mess with the atmosphere.

"Antinov","2018-04-19T13:07:27Z","Stop focusing on the average temperature going up part, and painting it as being about warming. That's not the only potential issue. The main problem is more energy being trapped in the atmosphere of earth period. We humans and a lot of the other life on earth have gotten used to the way the climate has been for quite some time. You say why change the way we live? That's exactly what people concerned about a climate shift are thinking too.

I mean, you think eliminating coal, gas and oil in favour of hydro, nuclear, wind, solar or tidal is a horrible change. How about less food to go around because where it was good to grow food moves? Bigger energy bill to both heat and cool your home in more extreme seasons. Humans will probably survive a major climate shift, no doubt about that. But it wont be particularly fun.

The reasonable scientists are not saying that humans are the only force behind climate change, but they are a factor. Switching over to electric cars and slapping some solar panels on your roof isn't going to cut it though. Both sides on the extremes of the climate issue distort and drown out reason on the matter with pure emotion and hyperbole.

What we want to do to ensure comfort and out current way of living is to mitigate as much of the shifting climate as we can. Either by better capturing the emissions of greenhouse gasses (Which is everything from CO2 to Methane) Or replacing them with non-polluting sources. Ideally more hydro electric and nuclear. And wind/solar where it's viable. Moving over to EV's isn't even remotely a solution unless power generation that doesn't emit greenhouse gas is in place anyhow.

But better than EVs, would be changing infrastructure to encourage people not to drive period. Better mass transit, less distance between work, necessities and housing. Not only does that serve to reduce greenhouse gases, but also smog and air pollution in cities. It also improves the economies of areas where everyone has access to transport to work and necessities.

But I have no doubts whiny liberals and deniers will continue to drown out rational opinions and plans for the foreseeable future."

There is no debate at all there never really was the evidence is just so overwhelming.
That the climate is changing is proven.
That it is changing faster then ever before recorded or found in evidence is clear.
That CO2 is the only factor increasing that can not be unaccounted for is proven. (there are loads of reasons for temperature changes but all have been checked of under scientific studies)
Each year the world produces green house gases and absorbs same gases. Until 1850ish this was more or less a 0% +/- thing.
Then something changed a little more gases were produced then absorbed. It seems like a tiny part even today it is not much each year. But like a bank account it increases with every year and slowly builds up. Now 170 years later almost 32% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is man made. We still add less then 1% each year but we are starting to see some effects.

The more pins, CO2 molecules, the more bouncing around you get.  Then the infrared photons are absorbed by H2O molecules causing evaporation, which causes even more pins in that pinball machine.  That is what slows the balls, infrared photons, from escaping into the stratosphere and eventually into outer space, cooling the planet.  Infrared photons are a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Consequently, on entrance, the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum that is blocked by CO2 and H2O is also very small.  It is the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum on the entrance that is absorbed, converted and released into the infrared spectrum that is being blocked by the additional CO2 and H2O on the exit of the planet that is making the difference.  The planet is clearly heating and for a reason.  With a cooling Sun, there has to be an additional factor in the climate equation.  CO2 has very specific properties that are widely understood.

If those taxes were on carbon fuels like Natural Gas, Oil and Coal use instead, we could reduce the use of carbon fuels and still have taxes to fund the things we have Government for, education, police and criminal justice system protection, roads and bridges.

If all motor vehicles paid a tax on the gasoline they use and not a sales tax on the purchase of the motor vehicle, a hybrid engine and motor system could be in every vehicle and still use 33 percent less gasoline.

https://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/pages/Information/VehicleEmissionsCO2 is the main greenhouse gas produced by motor vehicles. ... Air pollutant emissions, such as hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter can ...

Fact: There is no practical necessity whatsoever, whereby it is a necessity for humankind to continue to make use of the primitive energy wasting method, of burning billions of tons of toxic air-polluting fossil fuels. In exchange for obtaining (distilling) the more concentrated neurological, neurogenic, and carcinogenic toxic elements of petroleum fuels, which are later invisibly released into the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere; to pollute mutate and to poison every living creature and thing on the planet. 

Regardless as to whether a person is a climate change sceptic or not, why would anyone wish to support billions of tons of neuro-toxic carcinogen hydrocarbons, being constantly vented into the atmosphere we all have to breathe. 

Over that of making using of the unlimited quantities of free natural energy, which could be quickly made available; if it were not for corrupt politicians and governments, acting at the behest of their Corporate masters rather than for the benefit of the people who elect them and they disingenuously claim to serve. 

Natural Sources of energy Wind Turbine ‚Äì Solar ‚Äì Hydro ‚Äì Water Wave ‚Äì Water Current - Geothermal ‚Äì Composting - Sewage/Methane ‚Äì Organic/Alcohol etc. Wind Turbines.

Contrary to the views put forward by their critics, properly designed wind turbines are the major solution for generating unlimited amounts of electrical energy and scrubbing the atmosphere clear of excess Co2, GHG‚Äôs and hydrocarbon pollutants.

Current vertical rotor wind turbines are noisy, inefficient, cause bird strikes, take up far too much ground space, are a blot on the landscape, kill birdlife, and are a health hazard due to their electromagnetic emissions, in sum they are primitive. 

Reference: Wind energy frequently asked questions (FAQ) | EWEA http://www.ewea.org/wind-energy-basics/faq/ Wind Turbine Size To Output Power: 

7.5 MW turbines are the largest today with blades about 60 metres long ‚Äì over half the length of a rotor diameter of over 120 metres ‚Äì longer than a football field. 15 MW turbines are planned and 20 MW turbines are considered to be theoretically possible. 

At some time or another, all of us will have seen the rotating mill roof vents which are used to extract excess heat from our homes and factories. Unlike the single direction limited amounts of wind power gained from two or three rotor blade turbines, rotating mill vents have a complete all-around wind surface area of 360 degrees. 

Comparatively, relative to the diameter and height of the lateral rotating mill, this factor grants the lateral rotating mill the ability to gain many times the amount of wind force available, to that of vertical rotor turbines.  

Most importantly: Any number of lateral rotating mills could be stacked one over the other in multi-level wind towers, and if manufactured in prefabricated interlocking sections, they could be connected and erected to any desired height on site.   
Unlike vertical rotor wind towers which deliver the rotational power to a single elevated turbine. Multi-level lateral rotating mills would deliver their combined rotational power (torque) to a single central vertical drive shaft, which would descend into either a single powerful motor turbine below ground level, or to form a central hub of torque delivering its power in a cartwheel fashion to a surrounding circle of turbines. 


And as the turbines would be enclosed below ground level, electromagnetic emissions would not be a health risk as they as well as noise would be absorbed by the ground surrounding the turbines enclosure. 


Also unlike the vertical wind rotors on current wind turbines which cannot be enclosed, and kill birds. Lateral rotational mills can be entirely surrounded by mesh to prevent birds flying into the rotating mills. 

Wind Turbine Energy Efficiency Betz's law gives a maximum of 59% of the wind power exerted, as to be available for conversion into mechanical energy, via a conventional vertical wind turbine. 

All elevated wind turbines are subject to a gravitational and wind leverage effect, (yaw) which causes friction and reduces the efficiency within the turbines. 

Lateral rotating mills would suffer no such problem, as there is no gravitational or wind resistance factor to contend with, as rotating mills simply spin faster in high winds. 

However, as a means of allowing rotating mills to work at the highest level of performance in low wind strength locals,  magnetic levitation rings could be incorporated into the towers, to eliminate any element‚Äôs of rotational friction.  

In Sum 

Given the national grid system, there is no reason why enough electricity could not be generated from multi-level rotational mill towers operating over an area of perhaps three to four square kilometres of ground space, to meet and to exceed the total electricity requirements of Australia. 

Global Sources of Heat 
The Earth‚Äôs radius is approximately 6,371 km and its surface area is approximately 510 million square kilometres (196,900,000 square miles) with an average of 1,000 watts of solar energy per square metre. 
+ Trillions of kilowatts of heat released into rivers and oceans from the motors, and the heated toxic effluents from hundreds of millions of washing machines, dishwashers, showers, baths, and sewage from toilets, every year. 
+ Billions of kilowatts of heat released from hundreds of millions of tons of curing construction concrete, and brick and ceramic kilns every year. 
+ Billions of megawatts of heat released from the exhaust gases of billions of vehicles, trains, shipping, aircraft, NASA rockets, and the munitions of war every year. 
+ Billions of kilowatts of wasted heat released into rivers oceans and atmosphere from Nuclear power stations every year. 
+ Trillions of kilowatts of wasted heat released from burning billions of tons of coal to convert oil and bitumen into industrial and domestic oils, diesel kerosene, petroleum, petrochemicals, pesticides, herbicides etc. 
+ Trillions of more kilowatts of wasted heat used to convert oil into plastic and mould it into billions of tons of plastic trash, that is choking and poisoning the life out of tens of billions of marine land and birdlife every year. 
+ Trillions of megawatts of heat released from mining, and smelting billions of tons of iron and steel, to make trillions of tin cans, vehicles, trains, ships aircraft, industrial and domestic machinery etc. etc. etc. 
+ Billions of kilowatts of heat released from oceanic acidification, and chemically reactive domestic and industrial effluents every year. 
+ Billions of megawatts of heat released from fires used for land clearance, every year. 
+ Billions of kilowatts of heat released from billions of decomposing trees and vegetation due to land clearance, every year (3.6 Billion trees that were felled in 2012 alone, an area the size of Germany). 
+ Billions of megawatts of heat increase, due to the loss of shade and the cooling transpiration of billions of trees, due to land clearance. 
+ The sum of the extra heat retained by the Greenhouse Effect; due to the release of the 50+% of water content from, e.g. the 3.6 Billion trees that were felled in 2012 alone
+ Billions of megawatts of solar and motor vehicle heat being absorbed by billions of acres of black asphalt roads, and concrete cities, and released by runoff rain into sewers, rivers, and oceans. 
+ The sum of extra heat retained by the Greenhouse effect; due to billions of cubic metres of heat-absorbing and radiating hydrocarbons being released into the atmosphere every year.

Waterway pollution, cut in half.  

Multiple peer reviewed studies utilizing AVHRR satellite data now confirm CO2 as the primary reason for the observed 13% planetary greening since 1981. That's observed, and confirmed. We've known almost forever that CO2 is plant food, and that the planet has been suffering a CO2 deficit for hundreds of years.  NASA tries to downplay the greening by claiming from lab experiments it's temporary, but in 35 years there's still no sign that's true in the real world.

Dude!  There's no way I'm going to sift through all of that COPY & PASTE blather.  There's just as much research to refute everything you posted. ¬†

Scientists are just like politicians.  They need other people's money to continue doing what they love and they will find whatever they need to find, even if they have to create it.  Not too many years back it was acid rain and global cooling.  Don't let them fool you with their dog and pony show.  

Science assumes they know the initial conditions of earth and how it's evolved, what they weather was like, the atmosphere and so on.  These are all assumptions because nobody was there to observe it, measure it or test it.  It's forensic evidence at best with no standard to compare it to. ¬†They don't even know what they don't know.

"Rick Davis","2019-03-06T15:33:53Z","@Andrew-Paul Clements 
I just happened to see this.  How can you claim to be a Christian but believe science instead of the Bible?  The Bible is very clear on the length of a day in the creation account found in Genesis.  The Bible is also very clear on how man was created in God's image and not through a process of evolultion.  

Evolution: change over time.  It can refer to anything and not just life.  In this instance, it's referring to common descent--our distant cousin is a syphilis bacteria, a banana and a giant saguaro cactus.

Evolutionary scientists have a huge agenda--disproving God and they need billions of years for their evolution to explain where we came from.  If they don't have that, evolution falls flat on its face.  Thank God, literally, that science continues to provide evidence that contradicts science's fallacies.  

Many things are showing up that discredit radiometric dating and if that's wrong, then the age of the earth, as put forth by science, it wrong.  Everything science knows about the past is based purely on assumptions and presuppostions about the initial conditions when everything began.  Nobody was there to observe, measure or test anything that took place.  It's a guessing game and only when they plug in billions of years to their model, does it all work.

Carbon-14 has been found in 2 billion year old diamonds.  C-14 has a half life of 5730 years so for it to last one-hundred thousand years would be a stretch.

Tree stumps that were dated at 40k years old were found imbedded in Rock hundreds of millions of years old.  

Fresh, short-lived tissue has been found int dinosaur bones that shouldn't last thousands of years but are supposed to be as old as 450 million years old.  Some dinosaur bones that have been found aren't even mineralized.  

Six independent laboratories dated sedimnetary rock that was laid down from mud flows at Mount Saint Helens between tens of thousands of years old to 2.8 million years old.

My point; science has been so wrong in the past.  They keep pushing this saying they have it all figured out but it's a lie.  They haven't got a clue as to how life even began and we're supposed to believe they know how and from what we evolved?

Keep an eye on genetics because it is destroying Darwin's theory."

"Isaac West","2018-01-29T03:54:15Z","I believe in Climate Change. It's been happening for 4.6b years. Where I change my opinion is if its man made and if its dangerous. Stossel have already talked about whether its dangerous (I live in Canada, so I'll take the warmth). Carbon? Really?! That is the stupidest thing ever. Every animal emits carbon (predominately in Carbon Dioxide). The two main ways are exhaling and farting. Carbon is more important to every organism on this earth than oxygen (that I know of). There are also the hundreds of statistics supporting either side. So, I think of it logically. One, is that over 60% (I don't recall the exact number) of the atmosphere was Carbon in the Devonian period. Life flourished. So what if the ocean's rising? Just go to the midwest, I'm sure the Democrats would love to create a huge welfare to help people do that and blame the increased debt on the rich. So how much is fracking contributing, well think of it this way:
---Humans live only on land. Seeing that 77% of the earth is water, that dwindles the amount of earth humans take up to 23%.
---However, humans don't liver everywhere on land. Antarctica, the Sahara Desert, most of Australia, Canada and Russia, much of the Amazon rainforest, and plenty more spots of earth are uninhabited. That dwindles the number to maybe 14%.
---So how much of what humans inhabit is taken up by fracking factories? Maybe 0.001%. So about 0.00014% of the earth is taken up by fracking factories. So I'm supposed to believe that 0.00014% of the earth is responsible for over 70% of the carbon in the atmosphere?"

"Lesco Brandon","2018-01-27T18:53:47Z","Laurentide Ice Sheet
The Laurentide Ice Sheet was a massive sheet of ice that covered millions of square kilometers, including most of Canada and a large portion of the northern United States, multiple times during the Quaternary glacial epochs‚Äî from 2.588 ¬± 0.005 million years ago to the present.[1] The last advance covered most of northern North America between c. 95,000 and c. 20,000 years before the present day, and among other geomorphological effects, gouged out the five Great Lakes and the hosts of smaller lakes of the Canadian shield. These lakes extend from the eastern Northwest Territories, through most of northern Canada, and the upper Midwestern United States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) to the Finger Lakes, through Lake Champlain and Lake George areas of New York, across the northern Appalachians into and through all of New England and Nova Scotia. At times, the ice sheet's southern margin included the present-day sites of northeastern coastal towns and cities such as Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boston, New York City, and Great Lakes coastal cities and towns as far south as Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri‚Äîand then followed quite precisely the present course of the Missouri River up to the northern slopes of the Cypress Hills, beyond which it merged with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The ice coverage extended approximately as far south as 38 degrees latitude in the mid-continent.[2]

Ok, who were the men who melted all that ice 20,000 years ago?"

"Jeff Harbaugh","2018-01-23T03:00:49Z","How I introduce the concept of Peak Oil;

""What can I do""?  

According to the experts you should:
1. Garden with sustainable agriculture techniques (less pesticides and fertilizer (organic or better yet permaculture)).
2. Buy food and manufactured goods made locally
3. Pay down debt
4. Learn skills they will be useful in the future and make friends that have useful skills you don't have (related to providing food, water, shelter, and medical care.  A necessary skill is organic/permaculture gardening/farming).  Very important: medical skills are the best way to ensure your survival.   All others will gladly sacrifice their life to protect your life, so you are around to use your medical knowledge to keep their  families alive.
5. I recommend to invest some money into technologies to increase the ""carrying capacity"" of the planet (high risk investments);
A. decrease environmental impact per capital 
B. alternatives for our food system input to improve production
C. alternatives to our current living arrangements, 
D. alternatives to our plastics industry, 
E. alternatives to disaster capitalism
F. ""Savior technologies"", ie faster-than-light travel, ""game changer"" technologies, ie Cold fusion energy & ""delaying technologies"", ie deep drilling technologies.
6. I also recommend you inform and prepare your family, friends, and others.  It is best to initially suggest people have an emergency kit... for any emergency such as flood, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, loss of electricity due to a winter storm.  Then, if the friend or relative puts together a disaster kit, what I do is introduce Peak Oil (by telling them of the 43 second movie trailer http://m.natgeotv.com/ca/2210-thecollapse/videos/collapse-of-earth  , the ""National Geographic Collapse"" movie on YouTube, & free book downloads;

1. Recent cycles of advancing and retreating ice sheets have occurred approximately every 100,000 years, as agreed upon by 90% scientists. In other words the world warms and cools naturally over that period of time.
2. The warmest peak of warming occurred during the Holocene (10,000 years ago, after 80,000 years of Ice Age)
3. The interference of man with these climate changes since the 1750's is far too insignificant for us to claim it has some disastrous impact. The carbon print is only responsible for an increase of 0.2% in the overall increase of temperature since the 1950's and only a small amount of the ozone layer depletion, which, although real, is not much to worry about (the ozone layer naturally reconstructs itself gradually anyway).
- Pollution (industrial and domestic and deforestation) is indeed a problem, especially in India, Brazil and China (the worst polluters on the planet), but even though it it is true they do wreak some local havoc, they have only a very  limited impact on the warming of our globe as a whole.
- ""Global Warming"" is nothing but a false theory contrived by the radical left to force the goverments (think Europe) they control through their ""Green Parties"" (Enviromentalists) to allocate budgets to their cronies, most of which goes into the bank accounts of devoted friends and corrupt politicians (the whole of the EU).They advocate ""clean enerigies"" (Biofuel, Biomass, Geothermal, Hydropower, Solar energy,Tidal power, Wave power., Wind poweR) as a total replacement for traditional energies that cost only a fraction and don't.change the climate.
- As with so many other things, the radical left is telling you lies, lies, and more lies. Their ""climate change"" alarmism is FAKE and PURE INDOCTRINATION.
Don't fall for it, do your own research, educate yourself, and don't forget that if Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, it's because he had a very good reason. You may not like him, but bear in mind he is a successful business man.

That's the fucking point of the peer review process. The real problem is that you've never even read a paper in your fucking life and just listen to what biased media tells you. I think it's far more likely that the shit you're reading is paid by people who want to convince people there's nothing wrong and fossil fuels are fine and the Earth is totally gonna be fine and we're not hurting it (which is so fucking hilariously wrong it hurts).

Let me explain. I like John Stossel because his videos about gun ownership are good. But this video is bad. Notice how he distracts you with graphs showing more people die of cold exposure than heat exposure. Trying to convince us that a little heat can be good! But the problem isn't the fucking temperature at all! At least not directly. It's the destruction of ecosystems and wildlife, de-fertilization of croplands and soil, mass species extinction in ocean life leading to less oceanic food sources, droughts and lack of rainfall, stronger hurricanes and natural disasters, sealevel rising and melting icecaps, etc. The real damage will of course vary by regions and some places will actually be fine. But as a whole, it's a bad thing, and the real issue that drives me bonkers why conservatives are obsessed with sticking their heads in the sand is the MIGRANTS. Poor regions will be affected, food sources and weather and the factors I mentioned above will drive them out of their geological location and migrate into more affluent regions. Jamming even more poor and unassimilated migrants into fewer and already populous and established first world countries will probably have some pretty negative effects.

It comes down to this: CO2 and methane are both greenhouse gases. Nobody disputes this, it's something we can measure in a laboratory a hundred times over. We also know that we are creating CO2 and releasing it into the atmosphere. That one's obvious too. We know that methane is far worse of a greenhouse gas than CO2, and melting ice in Siberia and melting permafrost in other regions also releases trapped methane and CO2, making the problem worse. So even if you're looking around now and going ""Doesn't seem like a big deal, I can't even tell if we are causing it!"" is fucking retarded because we know EVENTUALLY we're gonna have to deal with it. We can't just keep pumping CO2 and methane into the atmosphere and expect nothing to change for our children and our children's children. That's why we should start now and work towards better sources of energy. Like, why the fuck would you be against better batteries and energy storage, solar and wind and power that doesn't have nearly the same impact. I'm completely convinced that videos like this and people going around acting like climate change is a big hoax, they are just sticking their heads in the sand because they have succumbed to identity politics, and they've been told by Fox and right wing media (famously corrupted by oil industries might I add) that it's just a liberal hoax. Those people are lost. They no longer can think for themselves."
"Vito Pettito","2018-12-07T01:49:21Z","@No Idol The scientific method REQUIRES the peer review process. Nobody is claiming that the peer review process guarantees errorless science but being able to replicate results and review methods and see what and how people are investigating is literally the most important part of making good science. I have no idea what you're talking about in your second paragraph, I think you misunderstood me. Of course new information and new science can disprove or change our current knowledge, you're acting like I said something I didnt lol"

Remember when the scientific ""consensus"" thought oil and coal came from rotting dinosaurs and plants?  OOPS.  Wrong about that one.  Remember when the scientific ""consensus"" thought the earth was flat or that the sun revolved around the earth?  OOPS.  There are countless times scientific finding have been proven wrong.  Salt is bad.  No wait.  Salt is good.  Wine is bad.  No wait.  Wine is good.  Fat is bad.  No wait.  We need fat.  Etc, etc, etc."

Normally, no one would care what morons think. If they hurt themselves, well, they earned it.

3) The fossil record shows a correspondence between carbon dioxide levels and temperature.

considering (3) one must cause the other or both have a common cause. Since we know (1) is true it is reasonable to conclude that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes warming.

JUST PAY A FINE....AND YOU CAN KEEP ON POLLUTING

If in fact global warming is contributed to or accelerated by human activity...which is far from settled science....the SOLUTION is to develop advanced sciences which slow down or eliminate this pollution.

And the media has been recently revealed to be surprisingly unprofessional, biased, and pretty incompetent regarding Trump and Hillary.   I see that the media is biased to the view that man is  causing global warming that is about to kill human life.   
2)  A good portion of the public is scientifically stupid.  I see direct evidence on YouTube of adults who really believe the Earth is flat.  3)  I see that the general public is not scientifically educated enough to argue cogently with those Flat Earthers.  4)  The politicians don't understand the science either, but they will spout the lines that will get them votes, and they will legislate on these matters with the goal to keep them in office, and not the goal of addressing the problem. 

 So the media will supply wrong, biased  interpretations of the science.  A loud, good portion of the public  are too dumb to vote.

Heat kills less because you forgot to add in heart disease; the primary factor of this is heat and this disease also happens to be the leading cause of death.
This is also why hospitals keep their rooms super cold at around 60-65 degrees.  It's a general practice that if you turn up the heat, people die.

Opiniatively, I prefer a cold place over a hot.  Less energy is being used heating up a winter home, than it costs to air condition a burning home.  I can put on more blankets and clothes and eliminate that cost entirely--but there's a limit to how much clothes I can take off in the heat.

The only reason we have not baked yet is because of the oceans, they absorb the vast majority of heat and co2 pumped into the atmosphere, the problem is that the ocean can't continue to do this forever, they can only hold so much and this is making them more acidic Wich is why reefs all over the world are dying and fish are losing there homes

So take away possible man released contributions and they are insignificant. Mother nature warms and cools and always has. My point is - quit building on beaches and dunes, in flood zones, storm surge areas, flood prone areas, etc., and there will be fewer ""disasters""! Even if all supposed AGW CO2 was removed ( it would take a couple hundred years) the natural climate will still change. To divert trillions to change natural cycles will bankrupt the world! Humans can and have adapted to changes, and will. We just need to be smarter about how we live. We should strive for cleaner energy, but not abandon fossil fuels.

G. Wells's novel ""The War of the Worlds."" With a cast of carefully selected and cleverly scripted characters.  That event provoked the public with fear and widespread mass hysteria did manifest.

What we have now got kick-started around the 2006 junk science fictional documentary drama ""The Inconvenient Truth"" narrated by Al Gore. This dramatization of a catastrophic world disaster is intended to influence thinking to adopt Al's movie as ""could be"" non-fiction. Al Gore ""might be"" a super genius on a mission to ""save the world"" from obviously certain destruction. ""The Inconvenient Truth"" is also reminiscent of the 1973 sci-fi Fantasy film ""Soylent Green."" 

Hurry with no time for scrutiny, the unsettling, non-settled issues pressured ""atmospherically"" upon us are;

We must react quickly without debate, ""Leap then look."" Questioning Climatology would only jeopardize all of humanity. ""Oh the Humanity""

Only ""Time"" will prove them wrong and time is what they claim cannot be wasted on second guessing their prophecies of cataclysmic world altering events. Until then Al Gore and other Provocateurs will champion their cause by jumping to conclusions. Scaring the feeble minded and Children with Doom and Gloom weather predictions. 
 
These climate Provocateur's assertions are based on faulty judgments, characterized by idiosyncratic beliefs that are contradicted by reality and rational argument. The enormous amount of weather data that has been stirred up will never be settled while practicing the art of deception. Every weather event is exaggerated by these Provocateurs to foster contention while gaining support from Climatephobes by precipitating propaganda. 

The benevolent scientific ""approach"" is to fund scientific research to implement scientific experiments such as ice core carbon analysis, assumptions, and management ideas like ""Carbon Sequestration."" As no scientific ""solution"" is available to man during this futile attempt to curtail the weather with taxation. The intended and unintended consequences of bureaucratic intervention through taxation are what we must take into careful consideration. 

This relatively young  scientific field of climatology seeks a deluge of funding, a torrent  to fulfill a ""forecasted"" need. With the successful implementation of a Carbon Tax Law the funding could reach stratospheric levels, the sky is not the limit. No more ""Requests"" for funding, Climatologists would have the ability to easily manipulate funding using questionable methods.  ""Enforced by Law"" funds on demand,  Carbon Tax is a carefully planned Machiavellian strategy.

The global carbon tax has international implications.  Demanding complicity with catastrophic weather predictions can be construed as a threat that amounts too a form of intellectual extortion. These Masterminds of ""Climate change"" tap-dance around serious unanswered questions with imaginary, ""delusional even"" doomsday scenarios. The implications are not in the best interest of favorable international relations. Any enforcement through Diplomacy will cause tensions to rise all over the world, much higher than the tide.

Yes, a substantial financial stake is involved with the undermining of our state of affairs, an especially large one. The ""Climate Change"" vested interest has a sizable financial potential larger than world oil worth. Many get rich quick perpetrators are involved with ""Climate Change"" presenting inconclusive scientific evidence is malicious deception.  Advancing their vested interests in-order to  fleece the world with Al's ""Manufactured Crisis"". Orchestrated by Richard Sandor, founder of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and God Father of carbon credit trading.  Although this exchange closed in February 2010 after (CCX) reached ZERO volume. With a contrarian chagrin the typical Bill Nye type of junk science chicanery continues. ""Climate Fraud"" is a large-scale systematic plan that has been arranged for attaining a particularly enormous financial gain through fraudulent means.  This type of ambiguous criminal activity must be discouraged.  
 
 Climatologists un-married but in bed with the corrupt political establishment jointly conspiring.  People all over God's green Earth are not just insulted intellectually our faith has also been ""shaken"" as Climatology fails to recognize God's will. I implore Prayer as the solution, not fervent scientific experimentation paved with good intentions.  Adding a taxation burden on industrial carbon output will be passed on to everybody. Everyone will be paying through the nose for every breath we take. Carbon Tax is the 24 carat Mother Lode of Fools Gold Taxation, Taxing the air we breath

The vast majority of papers had no opinion, but those that did, 97% said there's human caused warming.

There's also the question of whether it's actually bad. More co2 means more plants can grow, reforesting a lot of the world. So it might go up then it will go down naturally. It's a cycle. Now personally i would rather it be cooler, because i hate hot weather, but it won't turn us into Venus or anything. That's ridiculous"

What kind of psychopath does that? 200 years ago, the 1816 year without a summer showed us that 1C of cooling could kill thousands and turn thousands more into climate refugees. The population of Earth has exploded since then, so a 1C of cooling could kill millions. It could also trigger an acceleration of the already under way cooling trend which suggests the Holocene started to shut down 3,000 years ago. Ignoring the fact that a glacial period is brutally dangerous requires a great deal of faith in delusion.

Conspiracies are one of the most common activities of humanity -- likely more common than sex. And in fact, many conspiracies involve sex -- like Tiger Woods talking to ladies other than his own wife. Oops!

Not everything is a conspiracy, but some conspiracies are crimes by implication. Example: Corporation hints that they want a favorable result to a scientific study. The corrupt scientist understands and delivers the desired result. The honest scientist turns a report with regrets that it didn't live up to their expectations. When cornered, the scientist refuses to adjust his results. Next funding cycle, the honest scientist is ignored when they apply. And the corporation implements a campaign of slash and burn on the poor scientist's reputation. This happens more often than you may think. One example involved biologist Dr. Tyrone Hayes.

KEY TRUMP Foreign Policy Advisor, 
National Security Advisor, & 
Republican Campaigner 
General  Michael Flynn‚Äôs
confessed  actions  violated the LAWS of the United States & the State of Virginia. 
.
As a high-ranking member of the U.S. military, with high security clearance, it was ILLEGAL for him to accept money from any  FOREIGN POWER !  & He Was TOLD not to accept the money, because it would be foundout.
... 
FROM A SANCTIONED ENEMY STATE !
$200,000 from RUSSIAN 'business interests' / 'lobbyists'/ KGB/FSB
$600,000 from TURKISH 'business interests' / tied-at-the-hip to RUSSIAN KBG/FSB.
.
1.
He was warned by the Pentagon that it would be "" ILLEGAL "" for him to do so. 
HE DID IT ANYWAY !
2.
He was continuing to accept foreign money even as he was part of a campaign for President.
3.
He was APPOINTED National Security Adviser to the President of the Untied States while 
accepting foreign money,
.
(( which is a damn Powerful position))
and
HE REFUSED to disclose his income from the hostile internationally SANCTIONED enemy Russian EMPIRE.
.
Manafort & Flynn  FIRST  ATTEMPTED  to obey US Federal Law by registering as AGENTS for a foreign nation.
..
in March, 2017
LONG AFTER BEING FIRED and Subpoenaed 
...attempted to claim that status back dated several years...prior to the Trump campaign
& during the Trump Campaign / Transition, into his presidency.
.
Hillary Clinton broke State Department rules.
But
10  (TEN !) vigorous / vicious Congressional REPUBLICAN investigations 
.
$100 Million + tax payer money.
&
4 DOJ & FBI (Republican Led) investigations.
.
$75 MILLION more in taxpayer money.
.
all found insufficient EVIDENCE that she had broken any laws.
.
$175,000,000+ spent and NOT ONE INDICTMENT.
Not one indictment on any charge in any state in the Union.
*
*
General Michael Flynn
broke many United States LAWS and Virginia State Laws.
Congress had barely begun its first, very reluctant investigation,
& had already come to that conclusion.

General Flynn was breaking the law on the payroll of a SANCTIONED ENEMY STATE
of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA
as a 
Campaigner/advisor for TRUMP, as a foreign policy advisor for TRUMP, as
National Security Advisor, a damned important position with an office right next to the president in the white house..
AT THE Innauguration, FLYNN was finalizing an agreement for a TRUMP HOTEL IN MOSCOW....
Remember TRUMPS CLAIMS he had no deals, no financial arrangmentes, no nothing with RUSSIA?????

**
Hillary Clinton
was careless, foolish, & arrogant, but she did not deliberately aid any foreign power!
**
Michael Flynn
Directly acted-on-behalf of a foreign nation, with a history of hostility toward the United States, & accepted a great deal of money in payment for that service. 
.
It was definitively  illegal, & comes very, very close to the definition of treason.
**
Gen. Michael Flynn‚Äôs
transgressions were more than 1000% worse than whatever you think Hillary did !  

and 
he was back campaigning for Republicans last week."

"Bill Leach","2018-09-21T23:18:56Z","Jumbi Clerk, no I think it is because you refuse to think!  In the first place 'a big part of the scientist community' agree that climate changes.  Very few atmospheric scientists believe that the activities of man are a significant contributor or possibly even a contributor at all.  The 97% claim ranks up there at the top of the most dishonest 'studies' ever conducted.

While is suspect that you personally have not been paid to be a shill for the global alarm-ism community, there are plenty of people and corporations that stand to make a fortune if 'cap-n-trade' were to become law.

The one world government globalists want nothing more than to be able to dictate to sovereign nations.  Even a casual examination of the proposed 'climate change treaties' reveals to true purpose."
"Bill Leach","2018-09-21T23:06:54Z","Keep It Real, and while there is general agreement that there is a pretty strong correlation between changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and changes in global average temperature, science is far from settled as to the existence of a causal relationship (either way).  There is pretty strong, but not overwhelmingly convincing evidence that changes in global average temperature drive changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration.

That evidence is so strong that while it does not prove that global average temperature change drives CO2 concentration it is strong enough to assert with near certainty that atmospheric CO2 concentration change does NOT drive global average temperature change.

One of the biggest problems for the climate disaster group is that global average temperature change leads CO2 concentration change, often by 800 years.  For example, the idea that global average temperature will increase because some time in the future the concentration of a 'greenhouse' gas such as atmospheric CO2 WILL increase is ludicrous at best!"
"Keep It Real","2018-09-21T21:34:12Z","Jumbi Clerk ,
That‚Äôs just it... ‚Äúthe majority of the scientific community ‚Äú did NOT agree on the amount humans contribute to global warming.  That‚Äôs all a lie. And why do they need to lie about it? They lie about it to get support. 
Let‚Äôs say that humans are contributing significantly to global warming. What should be done about it? If you ban the use of fossil fuels, then you set society back by hundreds of years. Are you willing to give up you cell phones, computers and electricity in general? And what about third world countries!? Millions will literally die, without those fuel sources.

(I am not saying that is the absolute truth and maybe we are wrong but you should at least listen what people that are experts say). You know nothing about science and you don't deserve us. To add some points, in the video at about 2:15 the guy says that the planet warmed and the life expectancy doubled.

It also is not about news media faking it. You can do your own research and find many reputable scientific organizations (with large contributions to humanity) also saying the same thing.

Here's our starting point, put an ice cube and thermometer¬†in a glass of water, put the glass in a window in the sun. You will see the water temperature will not rise while the ice is there. You must¬†conclude the ice is absorbing the heat energy from the sun. Once the ice has melted then the water¬†temperature will increase and evaporate.

Wherever the ice is melting you know there is an abundance heat energy and you also know there¬†is a time when there is no more ice to absorb the energy, further more this is self feeding there is less ice/snow to reflect the suns heat back into space so more is absorbed when that happens¬†there is nothing to stop the temperature continuing to rise to a point where food will not grow and wars will start over water.

The oil companies have known for more than 30 years the damage they are doing, but their greed motivates them to conduct an ongoing campaign of disinformation.  BTW, there is more salary money to protect in this disinformation campaign than in all the government science agencies combined.  Aren't you about tired of being their lackeys by now?"

Here is a quote from Richard Alley.  He is the Evan Pugh Professor of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University.  He has authored more than 240 refereed scientific publications about the relationships between Earth's cryosphere and global climate change.  (Info from wikipedia, quote from https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=337)

""Whether temperatures have been warmer or colder in the past is largely irrelevant to the impacts of the ongoing warming. If you don‚Äôt care about humans and the other species here, global warming may not be all that important; nature has caused warmer and colder times in the past, and life survived. But, those warmer and colder times did not come when there were almost seven billion people living as we do. The best science says that if our warming becomes large, its influences on us will be primarily negative, and the temperature of the Holocene or the Cretaceous has no bearing on that. Furthermore, the existence of warmer and colder times in the past does not remove our fingerprints from the current warming, any more than the existence of natural fires would remove an arsonist‚Äôs fingerprints from a can of flammable liquid. If anything, nature has been pushing to cool the climate over the last few decades, but warming has occurred."""

So lets keep making more inventions and weaponry focusing on our own goals and profits and forget about the rest of the world, and our future kids and grandchildren.

 Let's only focus on the now, because screw them right? Pfft... Who cares about future generations anyway? It doesn't matter how toxic we make the air, because we will be ""perfectly fine."" It doesn't matter how far the droughts go, because things will be ""perfectly fine."" It doesn't matter if some parts of the Earth (Asia) will be too hot to live in, in the future, because we don't live there, and we're ""perfectly fine."" Who cares about the fathers, mothers and children that live there? We'll be fine, and that's all that matters, even if America is supposed to protect the world as it's ""world police."" Let's just keep telling ourselves that it's not real, that it's all a hoax and live our lives freely for the next few years, not caring about the plight the rest of the worlds people and animals are going to have to suffer and die through. Let's not care about all the species of plants that may also die due to a changed environment.

Hey, in fact, why don't we make the most extreme thing in existence that releases massive amounts of fumes into the air. That will totally help the Earth out. Why don't we do that?  You know why? Because when that happens, they totally won't be able to deny that climate change is not real. So instead we wait, telling ourselves that everything is perfectly fine, that there's nothing to worry about, until there is.

A subsidy is money confiscated from the tax payer by the government and put into an allocation pot, and given to people who somehow arbitrarily qualify for the money. I say ""arbitrarily"" because it's the government who decides who gets the money. But a tax credit, by contrast, is NOT money taken from tax payers. It's your OWN money that YOU earned and that the federal government WOULD HAVE taken from you come income tax season, but because you bought and installed a solar PV system on your house, the federal government (in its infinite wisdom) decided you would be rewarded by it taking less of your own money in income taxes.

Interfaith Groups Lead Major Mobilization for People's Climate Marches (April 2017)
""The Parliament of the World's Religions and more than 800 organizations are proudly lending our involvement and support in partnership to promote the People's Climate March, the second mass 'People's Climate Movement' ... On April 29, many millions will gather on the streets of Washington D.C. (and in sister marches in cities and towns globally) in defense of science, expression of the world's spiritual, religious and moral teachings and from the conscience of the human race. Marchers will appeal to political leaders and corporations to comply with international climate accords that commit world powers to the strongest possible changes needed.""

Where is this main climate march taking place? Washington DC! The political home of the earth beast of Revelation 13. What does Revelation 13 say the 'earth beast' (America), would do? It would form an image of the first beast through the people rising up and calling for the government to enforce the dictates of the Pope and Roman Catholic Church! We are seeing this develop before our very eyes friends!

Revelation 13:14 ...'And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.'

This climate movement is becoming a very powerful movement, and one that could very well usher in the Sunday law mark of the beast. As we know, the pope made the connection between caring for the earth and Sunday keeping in his climate encyclical. And ever since his encyclical, this climate movement has grown very large, not just among the people, but among the churches and leaders of the world too.

Oh, but Donald Trump is against this climate movement right? Don't be too sure about that. There are games being played by our leaders, to deceive. Mr Trump also said that he would withdraw from the UN and stop America's involvement in wars abroad. Yet he is now bombing Syria, for no other reason that to further the agenda of Rome! So do not trust what comes out of his mouth, as he is just a pawn in Satan's kingdom, and as Bible prophecy confirms, America will be the foremost nation in enforcing the dictates of the Roman Catholic Church.

""The Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending. Its professions are mild and apparently Christian, but when it shall speak it will reveal the spirit of the dragon."" (E.White, Testimonies for the Church, vol.5, p.452)

""Pope Francis says we have a grave ethical and moral responsibility to act on climate change without delay, setting aside particular interests and moving forward in a manner as free as possible from political and economic pressures. The poorest and future generations, especially, are depending on it.""

So the pope is calling for immediate action on climate change free from any political or economic pressure. What does this leave? Religious and moral reasons. And why does the pope want to push the climate action without 'economic' pressure? Because he is pushing for the SUNDAY REST LAW, where businesses will be forced to close.

Here's a tip: Go do a search for the annual global temperature over the last X years, then try and claim that the planet isn't heating up. We're breaking new records every single year!"

In fact, the molten lava falling in to the sea has produced more chlorine gas in 1 day than all the CFC's produced and used since 1968. To prove a point if the Chlorine from the CFC gas was destroying the ozone that the chicken little scientist were fear mongering back in the 80's, then the ozone would be gone because of that volcano by now. The 1980 eruption of Mount¬†St. Helens in and the El Chichon volcano in Mexico in 1982 cooled global temps significantly.

Then a small portion comes from small plants, grasses and weeds, plants that grow extremely fast(compared to trees), then a tiny, tiny gain comes from trees, they take to long to grow and when they decay, they produce a lot of CO2, so there is almost no benefit to Oxygen in theCO2/Oxygen cycle."

*_1,600 ppm_* -- CO2 Normal
*_4,000 ppm_* -- CO2 abundance
*_8,000 ppm_* -- Rich CO2 levels, the kind which allowed so many plants that it gave us our fossil fuels
*_10,000 ppm_* -- Nominal CO2 on naval submarines
*_20,000 ppm_* -- Maximum recommended CO2 on NASA spacecraft
*_210,000 ppm_* -- The level of oxygen in our atmosphere, and possibly the level of CO2 when Earth had zero oxygen (before photosynthesis).
*_965,000 ppm_* -- CO2 level on Venus; but add to this the fact that its atmosphere is 92x thicker than that on Earth. This gives Venus more than 220,000 times as much CO2 in its atmosphere as we have in ours."

Population growth is a bigger problem, I think, and the more people we have the more pollution we are likely to have. Add to that most of the people on the planet aspiring to achieve the spoiled lifestyle of NA. By all means develop environmentally friendly energy technologies, but don't ask people to suffer as a result without proof that it will help.  Global warming and cooling has been going on for millenia. We cannot say with certainty that it is occurring now because of our lifestyle. The study period is too short. CO2 levels were up to 11 times higher during the Triassic Period.   If we have to change, we will, but give us the proof before you ask us to suffer."
"Well Geo","2017-07-21T15:23:32Z","Regardless of whether you agree with Stossel or not, his presentation in this piece is terrible. He speaks as someone with little understanding of science. He uses anecdotal comments that do not help his case. Climate has been occurring and will keep occurring. If you deny that simple fact, you're either lying or you're just ignorant of the facts. We can, however, debate as to what you think the cause is... as long as you come with facts. The rock record indicates that CO2 levels have been MUCH higher in the geologic past, along with temperatures. They've both also been far lower. As to whether this increase over the last 100 is unprecedented, scientists can only guess. Sure, we can use proxies in ice cores and go back 800,000 years, at most. However, the earth is far older. The rock record isn't nearly as easy to tease out rates of increase on such small temporal scales.

My main gripe is that both climate alarmists and skeptics are generally poorly informed or completely uninformed, knowing only what they see in pieces like this one, on CNN, etc.

I'm far more concerned by polluting of waterways."

We could double CO2 to mid-starvation levels of 800 ppm (today's is 400 ppm), and we'd get about +1C of warming globally. ALERT: +1C of warming is not a lot. One-tenth of a degree will likely go to the tropics; two-tenths to the deserts; half a degree to the temperate zone (contiguous United States); and a little over +2C to the poles. Scorching? Nothing like the ""hot car"" effect.
If we were to return to CO2 Normal -- 1,600 ppm (4x today) -- we'd have a global warming of roughly +2C globally. It wouldn't be enough to knock us out of the current Ice Age, but it'd be a good start. Life thrives in warmth. Just look at the population gradient from poles to equator.
End the damned Ice Age and sea levels will be about 210 feet higher! But life will thrive in the warmth. The Sahara might be green again (like it was during the far warmer Holocene Optimum). Most deserts will shrink. But life cannot survive well if we cool the planet from our already cold interglacial."

And our oceans will protect Earth from warming up too much. More warmth means more evaporation, more clouds and more sunlight reflected away from the planet, thus cooling the planet down.

There is a growing consensus among climate scientists that it's too late to address the problem of a warming planet. The speed at which the earths natural systems are changing is the main contributor to unpredictability. Fires, floods, droughts, record cold below the Arctic circle and record heat within the Arctic circle at the same time, slow moving and wildly meandering jet streams, anoxic events in the ocean that kill millions of marine animals, dying coral reefs and the daily extinction of species have been proven to be a direct result of a warming planet caused by carbon emissions, which are also acidifying the oceans and killing the plankton that provide most of the earths oxygen. Those are the facts as presented by climate scientists, some of whom still present their findings as a call to action but that number is getting smaller. The growing number of those scientists that dissent from the consensus are expressing the opinion that the consensus is far too conservative. A smaller yet growing group of scientists see this as an extinction event. Currently the earths temperature is rising faster than species can adapt and survive.

"beepboop","2017-01-03T00:08:45Z","1. Before the Industrial Revolution, CO2 was at a natural 100,000 year high called an interglacial. Then, after a century of putting underground carbon into the air, CO2 jumped up from about 300 ppm to about 400 ppm, where it hasn't been for millions of years. That's evidence that we've caused the increase in CO2, and given CO2's known role as a greenhouse gas, that's evidence that we've caused global climate change.

2. So, what's the danger? When the whole Earth undergoes a rapid change, when something that normally takes millions of years happens in just a few centuries, living things can't keep up and mass extinctions occur. But, even assuming the runaway greenhouse effect we'll get once the Arctic methane pockets burst is so bad that you won't be able to grow crops outside, our species will still survive. We'll become more and more dependent on insulated environments and the technological infrastructure to maintain them, until the point where we might as well be in a spaceship; but we'll survive, at least in the developed world. So, if you can accept the future where we lose most living species on Earth, where we risk losing free air and water and all the people who depend on those being free, and where we'll all have to pay more to more specialists to keep the same comfortable life we have now, throwing the Red Queen Hypothesis right out the Broken Window, then rapid global climate change is A-OK.

3. We know that government funding can't fix this. Informed consumer demand and anti-crony laws can. Yes, I'm a libertarian. Do what you want if it steps on no toes. In that spirit, I should remind you that a tax cut is not a subsidy. Using public domain laws to seize private land for the benefit of an international pipeline company is much more like a subsidy. Fining solar users in Nevada to protect Warren Buffet's monopoly on the state's grid is like a subsidy. And depending on whom you ask, the US' involvement in certain oil-rich countries, from installing the Shah in Iran in 1953 all the way to present day, can be seen as an impossibly huge subsidy."

Here is the science, every step of which has been Repeated and Mirrored by many other research studies.

With the knowledge that Human Industry/Agriculture were PUMPING over 100 times MORE CO2 (working with H2O)  & other  Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere  than all Earth's Volcanoes, combined.

They Challenged, 
They Questioned 
& 
They Critiqued 
the Effects of  Greenhouse Gasses  (specifically CO2/Water Vapor & their multiplier effect) on climate !

In 1970, 
NASA launched the IRIS/satellite that Observed & Measured in detail the Escaping Infra Red THERMAL Energy spectra between 400 cm-1 to 1600 cm-1. 
.
( Google:--------------->     IRIS-Satellite Research)

In 1996, 
the Japanese Space Agency launched the IMG/satellite which recorded similar observations. 
.
(Google:--------------->     IMG-Satellite Research)
.
Both sets of data were compared to discern any changes in escaping infra red  thermal  radiation over the 26 year period 
.
(Google---------------->     Harries Research Study, 2001).
.
They found a Dramatic DROP in Escaping (a drop in earth cooling ! !) Infra Red THERMAL Radiation 
at the Precise wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) & methane (CH4) absorb energy !

While ESCAPING Infra Red THERMAL Radiation is DECREASING.
.
------------------------------>       Green House Gases were  INCREASING !   (hand in glove)
 
The change in ESCAPING I.R. THERMAL radiation is consistent with theoretical expectations & Global Warming Science Predictions since 1965. 
.
Numerous Research Studies have found: 
------------------------------->        ""direct experimental empirical evidence for a significant 
increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect""/GLOBAL Warming.
.
This result has been confirmed by NUMEROUS subsequent Research Studies using more recent satellite data, Digital Balloon Launches,etc."

The Christian Triune God (who is the true God Almighty) did exactly that at Pentecost in Acts 2: 1-11, 41

1 And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:
2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
3 And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.
5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
6 And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.
7 And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans
8 And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born
9-11 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.

Scott Strough, Researcher in carbon farming as a climate change mitigation strategy
**
""There is no need to add additional taxes to combat climate change. 
The best bet is simply quit subsidizing those things causing AGW. 

((world wide, Fossil Fuels & connected industries TAKE 6.5% of GDP ..TRILLIONS in subsidies/ supports)))
.
In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems 
are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. 
So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, 
then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized!
A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible)
It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. 

We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won‚Äôt work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that‚Äôs right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity.

We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn‚Äôt real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all.

1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming?
Executive summary:
Yes we can reverse Global Warming.
It does not require huge tax increases or overly expensive untested risky technologies.
It will require a three pronged approach worldwide.
1]
Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. 
. 
((solar & wind Cost less & are quicker to construct + + they produce FAR less expensive electricity than coal))
.
Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements.
Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable.
2] 
Project Drawdown
The list is comprised primarily of ‚Äúno regrets‚Äù solutions‚Äîactions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5]
3] 
Farming a climate change solution
Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6]

We also have the name of our current period -- Holocene, which is an interglacial. And interglacial periods are an integral part of an Ice Age. This Ice Age has had dozens of interglacials and glacials in it's short, 2.6 million years. Oops!

Temps got colder after march. All of May, June and July were below the 1998-2010 median. Half of May was well below average, pretty much all of June was too, and all of July was. Much of June and July saw record cold. 

I Haven't seen the final data for August yet but understand it's following the same downward trend. effectively May, June, and July, peak melt season was below freezing and the melt didn't happen. 

Since 2012 which was the peak melt, the annual melt has declined, and since 2015 it's clearly turned. The Greenland ice sheet is calving so much this year because of the massive increase in precipitation/ice volume, but even with that calving considered in ice mass loss, the net ice mass gain for this year is about 150-200 Gt. The sea ice sheets are also increasing in volume. 

There is no getting away from it but the data has been showing for the last two years the Arctic ice mass is increasing, and this year it's set to reach levels we've not seen for a very, very long time. The data going back ten years only further supports the argument that this is cyclical and related to solar cycles, not CO2.  The data shows that since 2010 things are completely changing which is what you'd expect, and what was predicted by the scientific community which does not agree with ACO2 GW/CC."
"caribstu","2017-08-18T23:29:05Z","""And yes, much of it can be equated to coastal erosion or land slip as well as sea level rise."" You're saying the dock at Miami are slipping into the ocean? Where are you getting that?""

The world does exist beyond Miami. The sea levels are rising, as i stated, but that is not new, it's a fairly constant rate, and it's not speeding up. Depending on where, the sea level rise will also be affected by other aspects. Many places it appears that sea levels are rising quickly because of reclaimed land sinking. Some suffer from tectonic slip, others coastal erosion. It's not as simple as every where sea levels are encroaching onto land it's no other factor than the oceans warming, expanding , and rising.

In Scandinavia sea levels are falling because the land is slowly expanding back up after the weight of the ice sheets from the last major ice age has been removed. Kiribati is an atoll, some islands are from uplift some from accretion, there's numerous factors as to why the islands are sinking below the ocean surface. 

It's not ALL because of sea level rise and the rate at which sea levels rise in different locations cannot be put simply on 'they're rising faster' .... it's not that black and white. Miami included."
"caribstu","2017-08-18T23:21:41Z","""Sea levels can be very accurately measured. Satellites measure the micro gravitational pull that so much water has"" I am familiar with how it's done. Accurately is debatable. There are influences and the margin of error is still greater than the amount by which the sea level is rising.  The rate at which the sea level is rising is unchanged. 

""Or in the case of Miami- you can look at the docks"" Irrelevent

""You're talking like these are not measurable"" Absolutely not. The primary issue is whether they are measurable to such a degree of accuracy there is no ambiguity, and that is not the case. the secondary issue is do the measurements show any increase in the rate of rise or exponential rise, and the answer is no. I've never said they are not measurable and i'm not talking as if that's the case.

 ""CO2, average atmospheric temperature all can be measured and quantified"" anything can be measured and quantified. 

""Just a few degrees difference can alter ocean currents such as the Gulf stream with catastrophic effects"" 
That old chestnut. If that should happen, then there are natural influences which are far more likely to actually alter ocean currents, and jet streams, than the slow gradual warming of the oceans, which, incidentally, have stopped warming. The idea that anthropological ocean warming will cause the PDO or AMO to 'switch off' is just nonsense. If that is the primary argument for cutting anthropological CO2 then people worried about that will likely get a serious shock one day in the not too distant future even if they do, miraculously, cut anthropological CO2.  

 ""No, what's insane is taken what is clearly stated to be an average and call them local projections"" 

Please, don't do yourself the disservice of quote mining or making false statements about what i have or have not written. If you do not understand the point being made then ask me to clarify it so you can understand it, but I have not called them 'local projections' and that is NOT what i was suggesting, you know full well that i didn't refer to them as local projections and probably know that's not what i meant.

It will start falling apart where we cannot make decisions and keep up and we will lose. Well It was a good run. All things end one way or another eventually so just accept it."

No it hasn't. Solar output has a cycle of 11 years. Global warming trends have lasted through peaks and valleys."

"Robert Kubrick","2017-08-18T10:22:45Z","Rod Martin Jr.- I am responsible for me. Never on welfare. When I became disabled because of an auto crash, I didn't take disability, I found another job I could do besides pipe fitting. When I was pipe fitting, I would go wherever there was work, not complain there was not work within walking distance that would start me out at top pay with full benefits so I must stay home and collect welfare. Even my brother who used to tell me that he didn't mind paying high taxes so people could feed their ""chilluns"" has realized that they won't stop making the chilluns and the more you pay, the more they make and those grow up and make more and these people vote to take ever more from you, will in fact take so much from you and demand that their chilluns be sent to college when after they have taken all your money you struggle to send your own children to college. Then the chilluns take some course of study in college that doesn't have a job at the end of it, like gender studies. Sending the chilluns to college will not raise them from poverty to become productive, self supporting members of society. Like bailing out a gambling addict, you lost before you began. The kindest thing you can do is not help so it breaks the cycle of dependency. By granting help on demand, you are perpetuating poverty and dependence for generations. The kindest thing you can do is spell it out like I just did and tell them to figure it out while their stomach growls. Because they are much more likely to come up with the correct, self reliant, answer. People need some driving force to improve their lot in life and too much help takes that away."
"Rod Martin, Jr.","2017-08-18T09:54:47Z","Robert, I hear you. There will be a great separating the wheat from the chaff. But if you're wrong on some huge life issues, wouldn't you want someone to consider helping you before the great culling? Compassion for others isn't a bad thing, especially if you actually help. The unrepentant will eventually get burned. Yes, that's the natural order of things. Do you think developing your own patience is a good thing? Some think that those without patience (and compassion) will be amongst those who are made extinct. And I'd truly hate to see you so abused, even if it is ""natural."""
"Robert Kubrick","2017-08-18T08:45:15Z","Rod Martin Jr. - That is where you are wrong. I have no time for libtards. My brother who was probably a greater libtard than you eventually had enough but if the libtard extinction HAD occurred before he changed his mind, I would miss him but I wouldn't have considered it a tragedy, merely the natural order of things. Libtards will eventually replace Darwin Award winners."
"Rod Martin, Jr.","2017-08-18T08:30:45Z","+Robert kubrick, please, let's not wish that. If you do, that makes you as bad or worse than them. And I used to be a liberal (libtard), heaven help me! People can learn. You never really know who will wake up, unless you try. If you're compassionate for your fellow man, you will want to help them wake up. If you merely want the ""easy"" way and have them die, then you're part of the problem.

You see, the enemy is not Libtards, whites, blacks, gays, straights, etc. The real enemy are the selfish and egoistic (like your statement). The cream of the egoist crop are the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Gates, Bushes and Obamas. Please don't be one of them. Cheers!"
"4thphaseofmalaise","2017-02-07T09:13:04Z","+Jon Brassard - You are right about the questionable aspect of the 97%.. But it's an important point that this consensus debate is not clearly understood by the public. As is stated in the video even if there WAS a 97% consensus it wasn't for the idea that man-made gases are going to cause a catastrophe. The earth is warming - Yes. CO2 can cause warming - Yes But HOW MUCH warming AND is the warming CATASTROPHIC? Nope no 97% consensus on these most important aspects. In fact there isn't any consensus on whether warming could be beneficial. I guess nobody is getting any money to try and study this question. Lastly I applaud the new abbreviation that helps to clarify the root points of the debate - CAGW. The C is added to stand for the word Catastrophic as in Catastrophic Anthropomorphic Global Warming."

"Marcia Barlow","2017-08-14T01:14:55Z","Thank you, James Koutnik.  No, I'd have to get my info via the news, and I've not seen any news concerning weapons in Iraq either, now or in the past.  Doesn't mean there aren't any weapons there.  Just means I have not had any news of it.
But I digress; I'm not sure how this fits in with 'climate change.'"
"Ron Helton","2017-08-13T15:59:51Z","The ""Iraq crap""  was promoted by both parties and the military industrial complex rewarded them all with contributions to their campaign coffers.  War is not a left and right problem.  The warmongers are in charge and have been for decades.

Anytime the US government is involved in picking winners and losers, there is ALWAYS profiteering.  I don't care if it is the ""war on poverty"", the ""war on drugs"", the ""war on terrorism"", ""war on (add your favorite gooberment  program)"", it all ends up being a war on the working class and the taxpayer who have to carry the burden of paying for all of these ""lofty"" ideas.   

This latest ""war on climate change"" is going to resolve NOTHING if the government is involved.  They ALWAYS make things worse, not better."
"Marcia Barlow","2017-08-13T15:37:32Z","Ron Helton:  I too have not seen any evidence to support Iraq having any kind of 'weapons of mass destruction' or was involved in any way in 911.  I also agree with you on the 'Climate scare mongering and profiteering'."

"Rod Martin, Jr.","2017-08-18T08:13:59Z","+LuckyFlesh, bravo! We're already at CO2 starvation levels. When CO2 fell down to 800 ppm (2x today), many different plant species, worldwide evolved C4 species to cope with the CO2 starvation. About 15,000 BC, CO2 came to within 30 ppm of *_CO2 Mass Extinction._* The Biggest Oil Rockefellers and their ilk who created this ""climate change"" scam don't care about the environment. They merely want every possible method at their disposal for taking over the planet and ridding the world of those who do not share their sick plan. Damn creative of them, by psychopathically genocidal."
