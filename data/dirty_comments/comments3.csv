Nowadays deforestation in the tropics is a sad truth. We feel that it‚Äôs becoming warmer if local evapotranspirative cooling decreases.
Finally, how does it work? Evapotranspirative global chilling is the consequence of tropical moist convection as de motor for polar quenching, because of the obvious longitudinal merging.

This statement is not based on any factual data. Climate change has been a routine feature of planet Earth for as long as there has been a planet Earth. In other words, the climate has been continuously changing for the last four billion-plus years. It managed to do this without the slightest human activity, since there were no humans to engage in ""activities"" for virtually all of that time. If all humans vanished today, it is a 100% certainty that the climate will continue to change for billions of years to come. In other words, the phrase ""climate change"" DOES NOT refer to shifts in weather patterns caused by humans. That's as absurd as claiming that the tides or the sunrise are caused by humans."

The truth is, there is a lot we don't know.  Current trends say the past 10,000 years show that the earth has been warmer than it is now and forecast for the future.

"GamerVibes","2023-01-19T13:18:28Z","Just because the climate can and has changed because of factors unrelated to human activity does not mean that said human activity does not have an impact on the climate. This is pretty poor reasoning on your side. However I would agree that the definition of climate change itself is not something which necessitates human activity, obviously."
"GamerVibes","2023-01-23T10:52:03Z","@MrCarlGW The medieval warm period represented a local warming effect encompassing mostly Northern and Northwestern Europe, not a global warming effect like the one we observe today. CO2 absolutely has influence on the atmosphere and not a minor one at that, since it is a greenhouse gas. Of course it may not itself be a trigger of warming in all cases, it could be released after the earth has warmed because of another factor but in those cases CO2 still potentiates the heating. However it could act as a primary warming factor as well. Also just because temperature can change and does change naturally does not mean humans cannot influence it as well. One does not exclude the other."
"MrCarlGW","2023-01-22T09:16:32Z","@GamerVibes It was warmer 1,000 years ago when they grew barley in Greenland and Siberian agriculture extended farther north than today. The temperature goes up and down naturally. Co2 plays a minor role."
"GamerVibes","2023-01-20T14:05:55Z","@MrCarlGW That is not true, since around 1850 detailed meteorological data is being collected every year from multiple countries and organizations. There is a great deal of convergence on the data from multiple sources which boost it's validity. As for the data itself, it clearly indicates a constant warming effect. With said effect speeding up significantly after around 1960."

"Anthony Morris","2022-12-03T08:01:12Z","@Laurie Wood It's simply a different philosophy. You seem to believe that the Earth is some kind of nurturing, pristine place of purity and harmony that humans, like a parasite are wrecking. The Earth in fact, is a hostile place that will kill you at any opportunity. Humans have made it more livable decade after decade. Greater wealth also brings greater environmental stewardship. 

Examine the wolf. An animal that has taken several hundred thousand years in order to survive in its ""natural"" environment. A wolf leads a horrible life of suffering, lives to around 3 to 4 years if its lucky and dies a horrible death. Take a wolf out of its ""natural"" environment and place it in an ""un-natural"" human environment and it lives a happier healthier life, lives to around 14 years and dies a peaceful death. The natural world is not nurturing. The natural world is painful and deadly to all living things. 

Every single life form on this planet exploits its environment to survive. There isn't any kind of rationality, mantra, holy dogma, or even a need to ""make the Earth a better, safer, cleaner, healthier habitat"". There is a need to generate human flourishing while being mindful of our environmental impact. You see any and all human impact as evil. A hospital is terrible for the environment, but a hospital saves millions of lives and its impact on nature is manageable. Yours is the concept of ""original sin"". We've destroyed the garden of Eden through our environmental sinning and we must now repent. Its pessimistic and rather myopic."

"Anthony Morris","2022-12-03T04:31:58Z","@Keith Jones You're correct. Data proves that humanity has never been safer, healthier or more prosperous than at any time in history, by any measurement you care to examine. This trend has not only never been interrupted it continues to improve even after 200 years of climate change, 42 years of climate hysteria and the continued and rising use of fossil fuels. Humans are alarmist."
"SilverEye","2022-11-26T20:37:00Z","@Keith Jones It's interesting that you talk about religious rhetoric and governments and corporations hellbent on profit. Because if you actually FOLLOW your own logic then you'd see that the people using religious rhetoric are conservative religious people who don't believe in climate change. And if you follow the money you'll see that the same is true for corporate greed and government corruption. It's the fossil fuel companies that are the largest contributors to corruption.

Besides, all of this is so unbelievably stupid to argue Keith. Because even if you are so brainwashed as to not believe the science you'd STILL want to support the efforts to go sustainable. Because still these resources aren't endless, they're largely controlled by other nations, most of whom aren't too great with human rights or aren't too friendly with the west. Having green energy supplies allows you to have control over your own power supply. Having sustainability in mind keeps resources lasting longer without increases in price due to low supply. Having environmentally sound buildings or corporations means you spend less on heating and power draw, meaning decreased expenses. So really, WHAT is it that you think you are arguing? 

Are you just mad about the idea that we dare suggest that human activity is responsible? Have you seriously never been or seen image from a heavily industrialized area? Never seen the data of microplastics even in our own bodies? It just such an unbelievably pointless thing to argue that just ends up destroying lives. So why Keith? Why are you like this? Listen to the damn science. For once in your life be aware that people who have studied the subject might know better than you.

Or if you can't do that at least follow your own damn logic and look at who are actually the most corrupt and who actually uses religious arguments and rhetoric. Because everyone who actually lives in the real world knows that it's not the side that says climate change is real."
"Keith Jones","2022-11-26T20:26:42Z","@SilverEye Nope.  Our current trend of climate change is within the noise of the past 4000 years or so.  The projected temperature rise or forecast is less than the temps that were sustained for several thousand years starting about 10,500 years ago.  From the time of the industrial revolution till now, the fluctuations are within the noise and are in no way cause for alarm.  The earth was far better off each time we observed a time of warming and suffered each time the temps plummeted.  Look at the Roman Warming Period, the Midevil Warming Period, and the Little Ice Ace.  We are still within the temp ranges experienced within the Little Ice Age, but our technology has allowed us to flourish in a time that pre-industrial revolution mankind could not flourish.  There is no debate about the recent times (past 2500 years) of plenty and times when things were much harder to survive. I'm not saying I know it all, but these things are in direct opposition to the religious rhetoric of current governments and corporations hellbent on profit and control."

"Keith Jones","2022-11-26T20:06:10Z","@SilverEye There is no evidence to support this is a man-made, out-of-the-ordinary cycle, or destructive/disastrous.  Are there things we are doing that are harming the planet?  Yes, but pumping CO2 into the atmosphere is not necessarily it.  You can look back at all periods of warming and see that it was very beneficial, and periods of cooling were disastrous.  More CO2 allows for more plant growth.  There is not enough CO2 for the earth to flourish the way it could if given the proper conditions of temperature.  There are very serious academics that don't follow the dogma dictated by governments and corporations that are driving this nonsense.  You really should open your eyes and mind to the possibility that the things you are certain about may not be as they seem to be.  Three are so many things that are just not true and the topic is way too complicated for anyone to be sure.  Me included.  But one thing that I am sure of is this doctrine is not settled science."

Seems kind of likely after all. If it were external circumstances, what are the chances those changes would be small enough to maintain the possibility for life vs wipeout. Whereas if life does something that rebalances the ecosystem, if that is counter life, luckily those changes will stop as that life stops, slowly. In that way we could consider the climate be evolutionary driven/self correcting."

It was so warm during this period that there were vineyards in northern Scotland and a thriving wine industry in England. While there were certainly warm periods that were much warmer, and much longer in far earlier times, such as the era that produced the dinosaurs, the ""Medieval Warm Period"", and the subsequent ""Little Ice Age"" which ran from roughly 1400AD to the early 20th century, unequivocally prove that the primary cause of climate change on earth is the ever changing patterns of solar irradiation.

I guess Ken Bash has the magnitude wrong by a factor of 10.  The holocene has been amazingly stable.  On the other hand, temps warmed 8 C in ~three years during the end of the Pleistocene.  The idea that climate can change extremely rapidly is well demonstrated in the literature.

Some people post challenges like this that have no answer simply to tie people up with trying to figure out the solution when there is none.  Or if there is one they fail to provide the other information necessary to work the problem and formulate the correct answer.

Sometimes institutions of higher learning will do this to see if you can think logically.  They will post a word problem with insufficient information to see if you will try to solve the problem or come to the logical conclusion that there is no answer to the question as it was presented.  This is one of those."

""Climate change and global warming are two different things.""

Sad, really sad.

Climate change is when the climate changes.  Warm, cool, wet, dry, etcetera.  ""Global warming"" is the change from a cooler temperature to a warmer temperature.

Human caused proponents started out declaring that human pollution was causing global cooling and we were heading to another ice age.  Later they changed their rhetoric to declaring that human pollution was causing global warming.  Over the past few years the more intelligent and sophisticated human caused proponents changed their rhetoric to global climate change.  A more appropriate term for them since global climate change covers whatever the climate does and they can no longer be called out for being wrong.

Truth is, the global climate has been changing ever since there was a climate.  It was changing long before humans existed and will change long after humans are gone."

"Franck R","2022-08-31T13:57:35Z","Please improve your understanding before trying to disparage science.
1- at 1.15 he states ""20.000 years to increase by 5 to 8¬∞C"", and at 4.38, the 5x CO2 ratio is quoted.  So assuming (as you are) that warming response is linear with CO2 level, it would mean 4000 years (20.000 / 5) to increase by 5 to 8¬∞C (not 40.000), hence 1000 years for 2¬∞C (not 10.000).  But in fact nobody said response was linear ! If response is not linear then you may well get the +2¬∞C in only one century (currently only +0.7¬∞C/century, but in future temperatures are likely to raise faster unfortunately given the CO2 we are adding each year).
2- Oceans are becoming more acidic given the extra CO2 in the atmosphere, which in turn dissolves partly in oceans, making water more acidic (that's basic chemistry). So acidity increase is linked to CO2, not global warming. Then what would be the effect of global warming itself on oceans pH: I don't know, I personnallly ""heard"" nothing on this."

"Franck R","2022-08-30T17:46:41Z","Wrong. ""no-one talks about that"" is the typical BS from climate change deniers. This is well-known and has been discussed. There has been a period in Europe during Middle-Ages slightly warmer and another slightly cooler (roughly max +/- 0.4¬∞C). There was then a natural cause to this, which is today unclear. HOWEVER, what is important to note is the temperature reached: only a small change, while what we got in some 140 years is already +1¬∞C, and will increase much more (target of COP21 was to try to limit it to 1.5 or 2¬∞C, but we are not going to achieve this, thanks to inertia from deniers and lazy governments). And secondly, this is Europe, nothing proves this slight increase was worldwide (which then would have been a ""global warming"" even if limited in the amplitude)."

I know you lot like to think there is no difference between CO & CO2, but there is.
Fossil Fuels, in fact everything organic which is burned, emits CO!
If I was in a room with a cylinder of CO2 & some plants & I opened the valve to release a continual steady flow of CO2, I would survive & the plants would thrive.
However, if I substituted the CO2 with CO, both the plants & I would die from Carbon Mon Oxide poisoning.
Our rotting corpses, being organic, would emit that other gas, which until recently, was also regarded & called CO2, but now being allowed to use its real name, CH4/Methane."

"Petitio Principii","2022-09-09T02:25:59Z","While temperature is largely affected by CO2, it's not the only factor (not even the only greenhouse gas) and the correlation between concentrations and temperatures won't be always be the dominant one, even if CO2 is still affecting temperature at all times. The output of the Sun itself, and Earth's reflexivity (albedo) are factors that can dominate, even if greenhouse gases are still having the effect of trapping radiation, all the time. It's a bit like closed windows and doors of a house. They'll trap temperature, but in winter you can still have all doors and windows closed most of the time, and lower indoors temperatures than at the summer, with the doors and windows open. The correlation itself even seems to be inverse, in this situation. But, close doors and windows in summer, and it becomes a sauna, leave them open in winter, and it can freeze inside. So, all else remaining equal, greenhouse gases will dominate. And can even indirectly affect albedo: as the temperature increases, more ice melts, there's less snow, and the Earth reflects less light back to space, warming faster. In the other direction, volcanism will emit CO2, but also increases albedo with particulate matter, and cools the planet, for a short time at least. 

So, in brief, ""no, but that doesn't invalidate the concern with CO2/GHGs and climate, it's just more complicated than a 1:1 correlation."""

One such example, Assuming one is 20 year's old, his father is 40, his grandfather is 60, his great grandfather is 80. Which from the first to the last would be considered only if including the first as a generation. Four generation having 20 year's lengths or ony eighty years.  How much does any 20 year old know of their greatgrand parents.

Human's believe that we've come to be what we are today, since the end of the, what's referred to as; The last ice age. Some 12 plus thousand year's ago after the previous not last as it's referred to ice age thawed. And can not fathom that human's existed during the thousands of year's the previous ice age was in effect, let alone the fact that prior to it. There was a calm simular to the one we exist in today between ice ages. That lasted thousands of year's.

Though just as an asteroid would and could alter the surface of the Earth in ways that may not be conducive for all of humanity to survive. Ice ages also alter the surface of the Earth. But just as an asteroid would effect most but not all, so do ice ages. Meaning there would be survivors, just as they are depicted in various books and movies which are labled syfy.
When no if there would be survivor's, because nothing they had become accustumed to would exist in the same fashion. The first generation would have nothing to pass down to the following generation with the exception of how to eek out an existence as we know our earilest ancestor's did, when they spent all day, every day, seeking food, clothing and sufficent shelter by hunting, gathering. The only exception to theaching those abilities, to the follow generation's would be the stories of a life that once was. And because none of it exist anylonger, and retold over and over, again and again. Become convoluted to the point just as we have done today, in regards to the various stories of the past. Refer to them as myth's and or ledgends.
I find it ironic how most every one who has ever heard the phrase, ""History Repeat's Itself"". Never takes it to be actually real. Meaning, the more than 8 billion of us today. Are just the in a sence, current generation of human's on this planet we refer to as our's."

The climate changes when it is forced and human-caused emissions of CO2 and methane is the forcing mechanism now.  The last time CO2 levels were >420 ppm was 4 million years ago and sea levels were 75 feet higher.

"DS 1969","2022-07-26T19:38:43Z","So when we strike a point that the temperature melts both the poles, then an organism should resurface that previously has chewed up whole chunks of carbon and taken it to the sea bed allowing the planet to cool. 

The question for me though is probably two fold? 1) Are we able to generate the organism in question? 2) if the polar ice caps still exist, then we could be years away from the event that brings about global cooling. And of course the random fly in the ointment is the organism that achieved this still available, or dormant for the planet to use. 

We live in challenging times, and where our activity has speeded this up - but based on this video, we clearly do not still fully understand where we are going, or why, or how we truly change it. Science will eventually work it out, but will be in time for us to exist, or are we going to be seriously challenged for all our knowledge and technology."

"Don Kloos","2022-07-16T11:09:28Z","Theoretical conjecture, but spoken as fact. CO2 absorbs far more incoming IR from the sun than IR is absorbed ""escaping"" the earth - a net loss of energy reaching the earth. CO2 has only one active absorption band at 16 microns wavelength, that is in  the range of IR emitted by the earth (10 microns average). It has an additional 3 more absorption bands at approx 2, 3, and 4 microns in the range of IR emitted by the sun."

"Josef Niederer","2022-05-07T09:18:23Z","Sea levels were higher?  Did you know that the water displacement of 3 oz of liquid water is the same displacement as when that same 3 oz becomes frozen.  You can do a very simple experiment at home.  Step 1: measure out 1 cup of water, put it in the freezer and let it freeze.  Step 2: get a bigger pitcher and place another 1 cup of liquid water into this pitcher.  Step 3: put the frozen ice cube into this pitcher with the liquid water.  Step 4: watch the water level once you put the ice cube into the water and record it.  The water displacement of when the ice cube was frozen compared to when it melted will not change.  Also, how do you know that once Antarctica melts that the permafrost ground won't absorb a lot of that water?  And lastly, if you increase the temperature of the planet you also increase the humidity.  If water from the ocean is turned into vapor more often and is kept in the air then you have less H2O in the oceans.  In short, if you have more H2O in the air, then you have less of it in the ocean.  I think if you want to talk about rising sea levels you might want to consider how much water displacement we have today with all of the maritime trade we do and all of the other devices we have put into the ocean i.e. wind farms, fish farms, etc."

All biology classes beginning in primary school and for some of us ending at the university level, we were taught that CO2 is the very foundation gas for life on this planet as it is the fuel for all green plants which use the sunlight to convert CO2 into the live food which supports all life.  The end of world alarmest tell us with great urgency, that it has grown from a mear 0.000316th of the air to 0.0004 of the air in the last 70 years or it has increased by 0.000084.  Now in fractional terms that deadly increase is 1/125,000th.  Wow,  that would be like having $125,000 dollars in your bank and thinking you're now broke because you spent a dollar on a can of beer!  Yea, a little stupid!  But the alarmest point out the severity of this increase but telling us that this tiny increase has caused a worldwide increase in average temperature by an estimated 0.7 C in the last 100 years.  This is about as much as your body temperature increases when you get up from watching this Youtube video and go to the fridge to get that cold beer that put you into poverty.    On the positive side, farmers all over the world have said they have seen crop production increase universally.  Point two, to solve this alleged problem and save the planet from increasing another degree in our great-grandchildren's lifetime,  the governments of the world have been lobbied to spend two trillion dollars annually, the US spends hundreds of billions each year.   Earning these dollars so the governments can spend them to subsidize the world's rich people to do studies, buy electric cars, and build wind farms and solar farms comes at a cost in CO2 production.  How much? To calculate the CO2 represented by each tax dollar earned or CO2/USD we need to divide the CO2 produced by the US economy by the US‚Äôs Gross Domestic Product or GDP.  In 2020 the US was reported to have released into the air some 4.6 trillion Kg of CO2. That same year the US GDP was about 21 trillion.  So every dollar generated by the economy caused the release of .22 Kg (about 1/2 lb.) of CO2 into the air.  These subsidy programs are therefore responsible for billions of tons of CO2 being generated.  Seems a little counter to the goals of the anti-CO2 crowd.  Some studies suggest that these subsidies make solar and wind responsible for two to three times more CO2/kWh than even coal-generated electric power.  This clearly is not rational if one thinks CO2 is some kind of poison to the planet."

The Deep core samples would reach depths of the rock-based ocean. Thousands of samples we're drilled and brought onto land in the United States for storage and examination. They recorded carbon levels at the radiocarbon dating point of 55 million years ago that a mass extinction had occurred on Earth. The source of the mass extinction with carbon emissions or carbon-13 isotope that is typically released during a volcanic eruption. They started to measure the period in time how far back these carbon emissions have started it lasted between 5 to 10,000 years. The total Corporation of the Supreme Court high temperature planet Earth over 15 million years. So planet Earth have been plunged into a mass extinction CO2 traps enormous amount of heat energy.

During the ice ages, atmospheric CO2 fluctuated up and down with the ice sheet coverage, and it didn't take a direct path to preindustrial levels. You're right that CO2 is one of the main climate regulators, but it is also slow to react and there are other components that interfere (for example, land mass position, milankovitch cycles, and even types of life). And yes, without CO2 Earth would be too cold for life, but life can handle different amounts of CO2, even if it couldn't handle a lack of it."

Remember 1970s it was the coming of the next ice age due to 30 years of temperature decreases.

No-one seems to be talking about this.  Once upon a time, Great Salt Lake used to be a part of the Bay of Mexico‚Ä¶not just because of sea level rise (Salt Lake City is at 600 ft above sea level ) at some time in the past, probably the continental plate must have tipped a bit.  It may not tip again‚Ä¶.but it might.   And because of the accelerated rate of climate change, it could all happen much sooner than we imagine.  The Laurentian ice fields, several km thick over much of North America, I‚Äôve read may have collapsed in as little as 10 years‚Ä¶.if that‚Äôs the normal rate that ice fields collapse, it may be wise for us to be building backup cities in the hills!

And since the cause of the warming event and its abrupt end isn‚Äôt known, it does seem a bit cavalier to point to CO2, which might be a companion event without causation. It seems more likely that warming was a primary event, enhanced by the release of methane and frozen and bound CO2, methane being highly unstable and therefor quickly ceasing to cause a greenhouse effect and therefore ending the Eocene Warming maximum as abruptly as it began‚Ä¶ Please remember that no evidence exist to support CO2 as a causal factor in global heating.

We are now in a natural spring type warming that will last for 400 years. Just a thought, if we stopped this so called global warming we will fall into a ice age not a mini one. When this happens everything above Tennessee will freeze. Chicago, New York will be under a 1000 foot of ice. So for me I like this weather we are having now. So will not be doing anything to stop this so called global warming. Oh one other point,  the industrial revolution began when the mini ice age ended so not a big deal.

Whats worse, risking some weather modification or suffering the consequences of climate change, If it hasnt hit you yet you probaly dont care. There is a gentler solution, We can put dust into  high altitude like 45,000 feet.  We can use the natural   models of volcanic eruptions and forest fires to predict some what the outcome. By using dust, something that exist in traffic and nature, Its a low-risk venture, Using lime dust the lime acts like an anti-acid and remedies acid rain and acid water. I suggest we dont do the whole planet but regions where it is hotter then comfortable like over 90¬∞. Savings from air-conditioning can pay for the project. Wouldn't you like cooler weather? A byproduct of the action would be long term global temperature mitigation. I would say try it and see with one aircraft; we can use the 747 used for dumping fire retardant on wild fires. Put a dust cloud at say 5,000 feet then measure the sunlight loss. Lots of sunlight up there so all we have to do is reflect like 2 to 5 % of the sky to lower temperature 10¬∞ or 20¬∞. This is different than making rain because the only consequence is cooling. It is manageable because if it gets too cool, we stop, the dust will fall out after a few years. Long term i would say 10 aircraft on the west coast, approaching 50,000 ft, could drop dust that would shade the southern USA. Like air-conditioning, once you try it you wont stop. Bear in mind this is a stop-gap measure until we can lower hot weather producing gases."

Funny how they come up with reasons for anything that fits their ideology, like the start of the PETM, ridiculous as those reasons might be, and then just shrug about why cooling then took place. Similar ridiculous hypothesis become facts only when it suits the ideology. There are so few scientists left in the world, just when we need them they have been replaced by childlike ideologues with agendas. The first rule of scientific inquiry is that if you go looking for a particular thing you will most likely find it, whatever it is, because of your biases that prevent you being objective. Peer reviewed papers have become buddy reviewed essays that can rarely be replicated by others to achieve the same results. If your submission for review is not regarding a favorable subject or does not fit the required narrative then you are less likely to be published because you don't have enough 'buddies'. The most common phrase in science is ""we now believe"", used when new discoveries change what were previously beliefs, theories, held up as if facts. So for these reasons I think it is correct to be skeptical about the whole climate change industry and consider whether it is actually a castle built on the sand of ridiculous assumptions made about things that happened thousands and millions of years ago. Basically they are just guessing, so it will take more than the bluff and bluster of someone trying to get on in life by following the narrative to convince me. Surely there is one real scientist left somewhere who we can trust?"

"Jim88","2021-11-24T13:31:30Z","Looks like... the reality is... global scale climate change, including ice ages (though not mentioned here.. ice sheets that covered the entire earth) are normal and will continue to be normal with or without man's influence. Does mankind make it's own influences, most certainly yes. So does nature. And we make a lot of guess work about why it happens but it is most certain that the earth will continue on with it's global scale climate change with or without us. The earth has been around for about 4 billion years and we have been studying the climate with meaningful tools for less than 200 years. Some of our best climatologist (from 150yrs ago) predicted global warming & coastal flooding events would have occurred over 100 years ago. If & when it does happen, humanity will move inland and farming may be practiced in the tundra. RIGHT NOW, we are heading back into the next ice age that might likely occur thousands of years away, but it's arguably coming non the less. Like Geoff Wright says a couple comments ago about climate cycles, now WE get to experience it in it's ""present change"""

You do realize that if all that old carbon was released quickly that it could hang around and look as if it took super long.

Also how many trees existed back then cause trees today after deforestation number up to 3 trillion  and should at least take in 1 pound of air pollution a year compared to scientists claims if up to 48 Lbs a year.

So how would Earth put out way less than the yearly human out put when humans only put out 163 billion Lbs a few years ago before the green movement took off like now but they were kinda cutting back.....

And they said in one article years ago that humans out put more than earth. So somethings missing. Has to be.

And I was mistaken its 164 billion pounds for the US. Assuming every area the size of the US with civilization does the same. Mmmmm..... Still below what 3 trillion trees should be able to somewhat handle or right at the line.  

I think the Sun would have more of an effect. Not that we could put all the weight from strip mines back that could throw off the wobble slightly more than the giant lava tree of molten rock to one side of Earth. Just have to ride that one out. Doubt any plan to fix that if its part of the problem would ends well.

What rockets to move Earth. And blast away the atmosphere inti space in the process. Giant gyroscope maybe but technically impossible to build big enough with current technology.

Kinda hope they are right cause if not.... Well. Actually even if we had always put zero emissions it would still be getting warmer at about the same rate."

Industrial CO2 is acidifying the oceans and causing many species to die off or migrate and become invasive species and disrupting ecosystems. We are currently in a 6th Mass Extinction Event (E.

"lol'in","2022-05-07T22:02:27Z","The short-term cooling impact of particulate in the upper atmosphere (literally blocking/reflecting light for a few years) is an order of magnitude more significant than the warming from released carbon. Emphasis on short-term. Once the particulate clears, the carbon is still left to contribute a warming effect long term. Carbon's greenhouse effect (promoting internal reflection/absorption of infrared) means less energy imparted by the sun escapes. If the net energy gain/loss over time is positive, we warm. When we warm we release more carbon (the worst of which being massive reserves of methane in permafrost. Methane is a WAY stronger greenhouse gas than CO2.)

 The timescales for cooling due to particulate (like a massive volcano throwing material into high atmosphere) is ~5 years to reach 85% return, and ~10 more to reach 95% return"

 The current Ice Age has now lasted 2.55 million years. The previous Ice Age was before the dinosaurs. There have been 4 Ice Ages in the earth‚Äôs history. An Ice Age is defined by significant year around glaciation at both poles. There have been over 50 major glacial/ interglacial cycles in the current ‚ÄúIce Age‚Äù (these cycles have  tended to fall into shorter 40,000 year cycles and longer 120,000 year cycles). The last 4 have been the longer 120,000 year ones. These glaciation cycles are separated by shorter (approximately 15,000 years) interglacials. It was much warmer (4 to 6 degrees) during the last interglacial (125,000 years ago) then now. The interglacial before that (about 250,000 years ago) was also much warmer than today. Besides the over 40 major cycles of the current Ice Age, there have been many other, much more recent minor cold/warm cycles during the interglacial that we are now in. For example, It was much warmer than now, both during Roman Times AND for several hundred years before the ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù of 1250-1850 (during which it then got colder). Look up the ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù and see that the weather caused problems (crop failures, etc.). The general warming trend that we see has happened since the end of the Little Ice Age (1850) is kind of a tautology, since we are measuring warming from the end of an unusual cold 600 year period in the current interglacial. So, if the current natural cycle does get the earth as warm as it was during the warmest part of the last 2 interglacials, it will get at about 4 to 6 degrees warmer and the sea will significantly rise (the amount of rise depending on how long it stays warm). The last interglacial lasted about 15,000 years and we are only 11,700 years into the current interglacial, so we may or may not have yet reached the warmest part the this natural interglacial warming. They (a major Scandinavian study a few years ago) think that Manhattan was covered by about 25 feet of water during the warmest time of the last inter-glacial (125,000 years ago). Our current interglacial started 11,700 years ago, but it took 2,000 years for the ice to melt and leave the northern part of the US because the ice was 2 miles deep (depending on the location). Actually, huge glaciers 1 to 2 miles thick came down into Illinois for each of the last four 100,000+ year glacial periods and these glacial periods were separated by a 15,000 year interglacial warmer than today. (Search last 600,000 years of earth‚Äôs climate).
 The actual historical severe cold/warm cycles which were scientifically proven by ice cores, gravel deposits and ocean sediment are not disputed and are the REAL HISTORICAL CLIMATE CHANGE. Whatever effect man is having on the climate, it seems insignificant compared to the enormous historical climate cycles just in our current ‚ÄúIce Age‚Äù as documented by ocean sediment, gravel deposits and ice cores. And yes, it has gotten about 2 degrees warmer than when the Little Ice Age ended in 1850, as you might expect. Let‚Äôs hope that it doesn‚Äôt get as warm as the last few interglacials. Certainly man had nothing to do with these over 50 major prior cycles in the current Ice Age."

"zbblackops","2021-10-25T09:54:16Z","The problem with all of the current studies on climate change is that they do not acknowledge the meteor induced extinction event and the inevitable ring down of that impact in terms of its influence on a closely coupled system like a planet's atmospheric, ecological, albedo, weather systems, tides,  solar cycles, etc.  And most important this ring down has been going on for all of  the 65 million years since the meteor impact and will likely continue for at least some 20+ million years. There have been multiple past events having very long term world system impacts where the albedo of the earth was rapidly and dramatically altered. Each of those events took more than a 100 million years to return to a stable state. Each time the world cooled down in a series of shorter term temperature declines with associated temporary rises in temp as the system tried to re-stabilize. At the end of these long recoveries, the temperature would return to the ""norm"" of about 8-10 degrees higher than it is today. A  basic requirement for getting a ""correct baseline"" for any scientific study or experiment is to know the condition before any disrupting event occurred. Most of the studies being performed are recent and span only the last 20,000 years or so at most. We are approximately halfway through the recovery cycle from the meteor hit based on similar disruptions which caused global temperature drops and produced recurring ice ages and warming periods. In this stage of recovery changes will not reflect the stable state the atmosphere was in at the time of planetary impact. This means that the information gathered to create models will be inaccurate for the stable system and will likely lead to incorrect models and conclusions. And while humans have certainly had an impact on the albedo of the earth, this problem started long before humans even existed."

Any time this happens, you going to expose foliage and other types of environment to different atmospheric properties. After this happens, you're going to experience certain places that will change.


problem and the things that people don't understand, is that this is often time to change that's way too big for people to notice right up front. However, when the Earth's magnetic core slows down, this lowers the electromagnetic shielding and therefore you also get different atmospheric changes well. From here, the sun could definitely heat up the Earth at a later time. However you're more likely going to experience an ice age. Before things heal themselves.


Once the ocean temperatures get hot enoughand the core speeds up, the electromagnetic shielding comes back and you get more tolerable climate. This is the factor that this guy is saying is a mystery"

"Francis Nj≈©g≈©na","2021-10-16T09:24:07Z","Trees and other plants absorb alot of CO2, but in the earlier times plants didn't decay but transformed into peat, coal oil and natural gas. therefore CO2 from air was converted into another substance. nowadays, plants absorb that CO2 then cut down and used as fuel, all that CO2 goes back to air, remains decompose and take CO2 back to air, so no significant change in CO2 levels due to plants. In the earlier times there were no humans to burn trees as fuel, and in the undisturbed forest decomposition was very slow since there was no farming to disrupt humus and peat layers, if we can stop using fossil fuels CO2 levels won't reduce but it will be better since fossil fuels account for increased CO2 in the air. if we could switch to non carbon fuels and stop deforestation then CO2 levels will start going down since there is very little volcanicity. In fact Milwakovitch cyles predict that we should be in mild ice age which is counteracted by green house gases.  If the earth can cool a bit Ocean solubility for CO2 will increase and with all factors (predicted by Milwakovitch Theory) leading to mild ice age, then reversing greenhouse effect will be easy."

"Jonesy OKC","2021-09-16T12:51:56Z","The interesting thing is that when you overlay historic temperature plots and CO2 plots, you can see that the temperatures fall in advance of the CO2 levels.  This happens with every major climate shift.  If we are to believe that CO2 levels drive temperature change, this wouldn't be possible.  While CO2 levels can cause temperature changes, temperature changes can cause CO2 level changes.  Forgetting how temperatures affect the chemistry of the oceans, just look at how temperatures could affect plant life.  Imagine a planet covered in vegetation.  This vegetation converts massive amounts of CO2 into O2.  If the temperatures rise and plants begin to wilt and fires begin to burn off large areas of vegetation, the planet loses some of the ability to convert CO2 to O2.  As a result, CO2 levels will rise.  Likewise as temperatures begin to fall and the climate becomes more habitable for plant life, the ability of the plant to convert the gases will once again improve and CO2 levels will fall.  This will continue until the climate gets too cold to support plant life and the process repeats itself once again.  Once you factor in the chemistry of the oceans, you can easily see how we can have large temperature swings and large swings in CO2 levels with temperatures being the driving force behind CO2 level changes instead of the other way around.  It doesn't take a suspension of reality to see how this could happen.  It would explain why temperatures fall in advance of CO2 levels."

"Fable","2021-10-23T23:18:25Z","Why is the title clickbait?
He tells about the last time when earth was warming in an comparable speed and intensity. You should check your math, the CO2 concentration was for 20000 years stable, without humans burning fossil fuels. And then it nearly doubled not even in a century, exactly when humans started to burn fossil fuels on huge scale. But nice argument tho"
"Fable","2021-10-23T23:22:58Z","Thats not true. The theory of global warming is 50 years old and every evidence we can find is only supporting this theory.

We have many cities in low lying areas, we are vulnerable to storms etc.  etc. Science tries to remove bias as much as possible, it tries to take out the human element so as to transcend bias and intuition.

As a matter of fact, it is a posture of humility that brings us to consider that we cannot break all the rules of regulation between species  and mobilise within a couple of centuries the solar energy accumulated over hundreds of millions of years (fossiles) without undesired long term consequences.
You may be right in the fact that we are unable to regulate our behaviour in order to restore balance. Some would even argue that no living species can act in such a way, and that the issue of such an unbalance is always nature regulation through starving and disease. Moreover, the idea that technology will solve the problem it has raised is more than debatable.
Yet this is certainly no reason to abandon science and adopt a fatalistic attitude. That looks more like an ostrich behaviour than anything else. If we are to disappear, wich in the long run is unavoidable, let us at least not die stupid, and try to understand a little bit about our world. We can always try to survive and preserve livable conditions for the future generations. I see no arrogance in that."

Adaptation needs time. A lot of time. And there isnt any. All species so need trees for survival in one way or another and ours are burning down, being rapidly killed by disease or logged. If we are to survive we have to collect tree nuts and seeds for the future. We have to manage fresh water a lot better. And help communities stricken by climate disaster to prevent mass migration and wars over resources. Much easier to stop burning fossil fuels, eating beef (methane production) and destroying trees than to deal with all of that."

The first one I came to when I looked for the umpteenttime to respond to your comment was from University of California, Riverside (UCR). On their graph it shows the rate of temperature increase immediately before the LIA as +1 degree C above their base line 0. degrees C.  The UCR graph shows the trough of the LIA at -1 degree C.   The graph purports to show temperature changes on earth over the last 18,000 years up through 2005.   By 2005 the change in earth""s temperatures had recovered to the base line 0 degrees C with another degree C to go until it reaches the pre-mini ice age rate of change.  The Dalton minima within the LIA occurred late in the LIA (1790s to abt 1830s).  Closer to year 0 in a 100 year period from today.  The UCR graph supports what I said.  To answer my own original question:  No, the rate of change today has yet not reached the pre LIA rates of warming it has another full degree C to go as of 2005 according to UCR.  Q:  What is the optimum temperature of the earth?    + There are palm and baobob fossils on the coasts of Antarctica too."

There are hundreds of graphs and geological temperature maps out there that show a clear indication of global temperatures ramping up faster than the usual resolve of global cooling as direct correlation with the industrial age. To say that the average global temperature has increased more rapidly in the past 100 years due to greenhouse gases is really very accurate, and they in fact lean into the topic of how even slight warming can have a positive feedback loop. So no, not misleading at all, just a discussion on facts and theory here"

When the oceans warm up, they cannot hold as much dissolved gasses, including CO2.  This should be obvious to anyone who opens a bottle of pop--as the liquid warms up, bubbles of carbonation (CO2) form and rise to the surface.
Similarly, the higher levels of CO2 DID NOT CAUSE this warm period of the earth; the warm period caused the higher levels of CO2!!
Right now, at 410 ppm atmospheric CO2, the earth is supersaturated with respect to the spectral absorption by thst gas!
How do we know?  Because 50 years ago when CO2 was at 285 ppm, it took 90 meters to absorb all the spectrum CO2 absorbs!  Now it takes just 70 meters.  But in both cases, 100% of it is absorbed!
Besides, of the 5 greenhouse gasses, CO2 constitutes just 1% of them!  ONE PERCENT!!!  And we're supposed to believe it controls the climate and the weather??
Only a brainwashed idiot would believe that!"

I think I understand, and hopefully make it clear for other readers - In certain places around the world there are frozen pockets of methane in sea beds. If the ocean temperatures rise too much, the pressures that keep the methane frozen might lessen to the point where the methane sublimes to gas. Methane gas has a lot less density than water, causing less pressure, and would feedback on the release of more gasses. Of course higher temperatures could cause the same effect by itself. Please correct me if I am wrong. I am not sure of any other places where methane can be released in large quantities. Perhaps someone could enlighten us."

"Jason Firewalker","2021-07-10T16:35:06Z","Your final point that the amount of global warming happening since industrialization took thousands of years naturally is the crux of the dilemma.
 There are 2 modalities of evolution. Occasionally a random mutation proves so beneficial it becomes the norm in short order, a few generations say. This is relatively rare.The main driving force of evolution is a much slower process which is what allowed flora and fauna to adapt to the gradual warming of hot-house Earth.
 You can only poke so many holes in the food web before complete collapse and if you look at the most current research on climate change you'll quickly realize that a worldwide average of 190¬∞f by 2100 doesn't provide species time to adapt. I believe plant proteins denature at 130¬∞f. I wonder if that holds true for phytoplankton, the source of the majority of oxygen on the planet.
 Perhaps that's why the billionaires need all that money, stockpiling underground cities for an indefinite stay is expensive. Best of luck fellas. Maybe the Hopi were right, maybe we did emerge from the world below.

After all it seems nothing in the cosmos is ever totally stable and most things change, fluctuate or transform cyclically!?

So perhaps in its many billions of years in operation, the sun's  internal mechanism might also include moments of extreme change! Perhaps due to other cyclical processes and interactions also at play and happening in the galaxy?

Perhaps including smaller  changes that include the conditions for solar forcing, weakening magnetic fields, planetary pole shifts and reversals etc, etc..some of which there is evidence of, to a certain level. Even if we do not yet fully appreciated the how, what,  whens or why!"

One need only look at the record snowfall and cold temperatures of the past winter season to see the effects.

The CO2 and H2O then work in tandem to raise temperatures in a feedback loop until Earth moves further from the sun and the process reverses. Everyone knows this."

But if we were doing 2014s 9.8 billion metric tons per year x 50 years only comes to 490 billion metric tons. The Thermal Maximum event is far more than 13 times worse. 

Why do they feel the need to exaggerate the science.

That sentence goes against nature, nothing stays static, even if we make our environmental impact the exact same as that time, the environment will still change, even if its for a longer period of time that the change occurs, at some point later generations will have to adapt, or migrate, or come up with another way to mitigate the change.

I think our best path to take would be to think not over the next 50 or 100 or 200 or even 500 years, but what we can do to give all aspects of nature the best possible ability to adapt or migrate when that eventual change occurs, plan infrastructure and development for currently uninhabitable areas, that at the change become habitable, plan to ensure the habitability of currently habitable areas thay will become uninhabitable.

Our ancestors didnt have this ability to plan so far into the future, they had to up end their whole ways of living as the massive change occured. Lets try and act and plan more intelligently, conservatively (as in conservation of habitats, environments, species etc.) And beneficially towarda everything, like we think we are more capable than they were."

Yes, CO2 levels were between 1,000 ppm to 2,000 ppm (2500 is a higher estimate) and what was the cause of that high amounts of co2? Earth‚Äôs temperature was 10¬∞C to 15¬∞C hotter than today. Earth was ice free. 

Currently we sit at 415 ppm, the highest in at least 800,000 years. CO2 levels have been between 180 to 280 ppm for that amount of time (higher co2 mostly corresponded with the glacial interglacial cycle of the quaternary ice age tho wasn‚Äôt the cause) 

It‚Äôs a good thing co2 levels are lower now than in the past because the sun is much brighter due to the faint young sun paradox so Earth is comfortable for human life. Higher co2 in the past and lower solar output billions of years ago kept earth comfortable. Lower co2 levels and higher solar output keeps earth comfortable today. In fact one reason why co2 levels were much higher than today  billions of years ago and earth went into a snowball was because the sun was too weak to keep earth hot so more co2 was needed to keep earth warm. 

And it‚Äôs good earth isn‚Äôt in a hot house state because the mild Holocene interglacial we are in now is why human civilization arose. 

If co2 levels reach 800 to 1,000 ppm like climate models are predicted, global temperatures could rise by 3¬∞C to 5¬∞C by 2100. That would be disastrous for human civilization. 

And while earth did it naturally than it, it isn‚Äôt now, especially considering we are currently in an ice age.

Btw just because something is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for earth doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs normal for humans."
"Chris Graham","2021-05-19T02:26:13Z","@Premier CC Guy MMXVI üá∫üá¶ Except the PETM was 2500ppm.  The Earth did that on its own, we had nothing to do with it.

And no, no other effects you mentioned are causing global warming now."
"Premier CC Guy MMXVI üá∫üá¶","2021-05-14T00:59:14Z","Sure the climate has always changed. How does that prove humans aren‚Äôt causing it now?

For 800,000+ years at least co2 levels were between 180 ppm and 280 ppm. Now they are at 415 ppm. And could be as high as 800 ppm by 2100. (Similar to PETM levels)

The reason we had the PETM hot house was because of high co2 levels. The reason are in an ice age now is because of lower co2 levels.

And earth isn‚Äôt warming now because we are still coming out the past glacial cycle. Orbital cycles occur on long time scale, far too long to cause any significant warming in our life times. 
And the peak Holence heat was 6,000 years ago. Earth should actually be cooling following a 6,000 year cooling trend and we should enter our next glacial cycle in the next 16,000 to 20,000 years. But we aren‚Äôt. We are seeing rapid global warming. Why? Because co2 levels are going up. Why? Because human activity."

"justinlcosby","2021-02-01T23:35:18Z","Oh come on you can do much better than this. We know why the Earth cooled. Yes obviously high Co2 levels caused an explosion of plant life. Increased plant life absorbs more Co2. You lower the output of the source of the Co2 being emitted and you end up with a net reduction in Co2. As Co2 levels drop the Earth begins to cool and once the Earth cools substantially enough the effect of the Milankovich cycles takes hold and allows Antarctica to begin to start building ice sheets. Which in turn start to lock up and seal away even more Co2. You might also mention in your video the necessity for Co2 for all life because today it seems that most people are familiar with the fact that Co2 is necessary for all life on the planet and how we will all die if the level of Co2 concentration ever reaches 150 ppm. Or how much better plant life is doing today because of the additional Co2 in the atmosphere. That would be an amazing show."

If you don't adapt to things quickly enough as they change, you die. Even if you don't think that's bad on its own, if enough things die it will inevitably affect our food supply, because agriculture relies in organisms like pollinators (insects, birds, etc) to work. Without a steady food supply societies collapse. Our current globalized society in particular relies - among other things - on producing a lot of food to sustain an ever-growing populations. If (big if) it got so bad that agriculture began to become harder, people would have to either fight for whatever food there can be produced, or die of hunger, until the people left can survive off whatever the changing land can give. Bad times ensue."

"Premier CC Guy MMXVI üá∫üá¶","2022-12-11T16:19:28Z","@Jay Day humans are causing global warming now. It isn‚Äôt the sun, milankovitch cycles, or volcanoes."
"Premier CC Guy MMXVI üá∫üá¶","2022-12-11T16:18:58Z","@Jay Day ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù? You have no evidence for that. You are just using hoot opinion and personal feelings, unfortunately that‚Äôs not how science works. Secondly if the asteroid caused global cooling for the course of 60+ million years (which one asteroid physically can‚Äôt do) why did earth immediately go back to pre-extinction temperatures which were already 10¬∞C hotter than today and then got even hotter 56 million years ago in the Palogene where global temperatures we as much as 16¬∞C hotter than today. It was CO2 that did that. And why did earth cool following that? Because co2 was weathered out of the atmosphere. Again this is all established science. Not feelings people had. 

Also we are not still warming from the last ice age. Firstly we are still in an ice age that began 2-3 million years ago known as the Quaternary. Secondly we are in an interglacial period known as the Holocene that began 12,000 years ago. If you look at global temperatures the past 24,000 years (a nature study from November 2021 did this) our climate entered its current warm period 10,000 years and since then our climate has been stable. And before you say ‚ÄúRoman and Medieval Warm Period‚Äù and ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù these events were regional, mainly in Europe, and had no major impact on global temperatures. And no the Greenland GISP2 Ice Core isn‚Äôt global temperatures that go up to 2022 but Greenland temperatures that go up to 1855."
"Jay Day","2022-12-11T14:39:42Z","@Premier CC Guy MMXVI üá∫üá¶ I believe the asteroid is the beginning event, and many other things get kicked off due to that event.   Other events that can cause similar things are volcanos, specifically super volcanos.  It isn‚Äôt just the initial damage, but the debris in the air that causes mass damage to the life around it.  What happens to the climate when 90% of trees die off, how does. Not having trees and other life to breath and eat.  How does that effect the ozone layer, or heat generation of the planet.  We just don‚Äôt know.  We only know for fact that we have glaciers formed in the past and currently the world has been heating up.  Everything else is humans creating theories and playing them out."
"Jay Day","2022-12-11T14:33:43Z","@Poochie Collins I don‚Äôt think we truly know the full impact.  We can see the amount of debris that is trapped in glaciers, and we don‚Äôt know if the effect of trapping so much debris can cause much longer cooling periods.  Such as reports that out heating trend will multiply because of added release of carbon from glaciers as they melt.   The point is we have no real idea because we have no idea about the totality of the disaster."

If you do not have that detailed age model you can only measure the 'average rates' which are by definition much smaller than the instantaneous rates (see Sadler 1981 for sedimentation rates). Also this thing of forams and coarls collapsing during the PETM is the first time I'm hearing it.

He never proved that climate changes stopped at any point in the Eons of past history. Every form of life that has ever been or ever will live on planet Earth will either survive or die. Personally, I believe that no person or population understands enough about all of the factors that go into our present Earth's climate. How can we ""fix"" what we do not understand? I'll bet that whatever ""fix"" people try, things unknown or disregarded, will make life worse for people.

"Val Proton","2020-12-06T20:21:05Z","That's a physical impossibility. Carbon gasses are heavier than air, cannot get into the upper atmosphere unaided and in the lower atmosphere will sink to ground level within a few hours. When released into the upper atmosphere via volcanic eruptions, it will block solar radiation from reaching the ground, causing global dimming and cooling, eg we get a year without a summer. Methane being lighter than air can rise into the atmosphere, methane is the product of decomposing vegetation which is the result of a warmer spike in solar radiation combined with humidity. Any form of pollution in the atmosphere can only block solar radiation from reaching the ground, it is not a one way trap door. Temperature rise is 100% the result of greater solar radiation, while any pollution causes temperatures to fall. There is nothing we can do about climate change, apart from adapt to it."

The process that cool the planet down again by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere takes thousands of years or millions of years, and even that is only going to be relevant for Humans if WE completely stop dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, not just slow down or maybe over the next 30 years reduces CO2 emissions by 20% from the what we have today when everyone else is increasing CO2 emissions more then that over the same period, it's full stop and we have a chance to reverse the damage, otherwise nature will run its course and the human race will be extinct in a couple thousand years."

The revelation that global warming is a religion based loosely on science is hardly front page news.  What is less well known is that the same can be said for aspects of meteorology, specifically the convection model of storm theory.

Sea Water is alkaline normally, when the water warms and tries to hold more CO2 then the temp usually holds it then the ph moves toward NEUTRAL not acidifies. Those not pushing a narrative would call that neutralises.

Recent studies indicate our incoming wavelengths of absorbable light for CO2, CH4 and H2O are saturated in this day and age with little hope of further input into the temperature system, this is consistent with the work of the Conally father and son team from Ireland who looked at the millions of radiosonde measurements from the last 70-odd years and showed no signal that matched global warming theory. Other reasons for the warming would need to be put forward in that period (the sun was slightly weaker to now, the atmosphere thicker etc so there are various variables that need to be taken into account)."

Global warming is happening because as the axis of the earth continues to tilt towards the sun. More DIRECT sunlight reaches the higher latitudes poles. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect.

Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE.
Dinosaurs didn't live of off the little bit of co2 unthawed released right now.
Nor did dinosaurs cause ClimateChange all of those other times throughout Earth's history.

"Paul McGreevy","2020-10-18T19:07:20Z","The reason the Earth cooled is not a mystery but was because the Antarctic separated from South America and the warm currents coming down from the equator no long went around the land mass and kept it warm. The Antarctic became protected from the warm currents by it‚Äôs own circumpolar current which acts like a buffer. This allowed the Antarctic landmass to freeze and provide the Earth with an air conditioning system. The Antarctic landmass is twice the size of Australia and is covered in ice up to 15,000 ft thick and an average of 3,000 ft thick. The ice has been there for over 30 million years. The average daily temperature there is minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit and melting point is plus 38 degrees. Therefore temperatures would need to rise 90 degrees Fahrenheit to even start to melt the ice. Contrary to scare stories this can never happen for millions of years due to the geographic separation of the continents."

They find that natural factors alone would have resulted in a modest cooling over the past 50 years or so, compared to the dramatic warming that we‚Äôve experienced.
Also, ice cores contain an 800,000-year record of temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These markers were seen to move in lock-step. Whenever the Earth went into an ice age and temperatures fell, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also decline. And when the climate warmed back up again, the CO2 rose in parallel. These cycles occurred roughly every 100,000 years in the EPICA core - a phasing that is most likely linked to slight shifts in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit (the Milankovitch cycles) around the Sun."

"MISSIONCAT11","2020-07-02T19:36:48Z","An examination of carbon dioxide and global temperature over the last few million years shows that global temperature change came first and carbon dioxide change came second. Clearly the global temperature change was driving the carbon dioxide level.
Our sun is like a flame. A flame dances and changes shape and heat constantly That flickering is known as 1/f noise. The sun is dancing and flickering and changing heat output constantly, over eons of time. If the sun went out, the temperature on the surface of the Earth would reach freezing in one week, finally settling  to around -400 degrees F.
The temperature on the Earth is also affected by the Malenkovitch cycles, which studies the earth's axis wobble, orbital wobble, and how both are affected by the rest of the planets. The Global Warming conjecture, which originated in England, and not NASA, did not take into account the mighty fireball known as the sun, or the Malenkovitch cycles.

"hisxmark","2020-06-30T01:00:07Z","Warm oceans release dissolved CO2 and the forams die off and quit taking it out of the ocean.  The released CO2 and higher temperatures stimulate rain forests.  But the warmer atmosphere expands and holds more H2O and the vapor rising to higher increases cloud cover and precipitation.  Albedo goes down, ocean staying constant but the clouds condensing over the continents reflect more heat back into space.  Decreased solar insolation reduces the health of the rain forests, and the temperature which has been forced to an extreme now rebounds vigorously causing dramatic cooling.  
The oscillation, as one might expect will reverse direction from more extreme conditions.  Add sensitivity to initial conditions and the long term predictions become ... uncertain.  We can't be certain of the balance between positive and negative feed backs, but we can be certain that there will be extremely swift and extreme fluctuations."

"Vulcano","2020-07-11T19:48:25Z","Yes, we get you straight: higher CO2 levels meant better growing conditions for plants in previously unsuitable environments (the artic circle). Not just through T but also in a change of humidity levels. On the other hand certain regions are now unsuitable for plant growth (e.g. the tropics). So it kinda evens it out and a stable CO2-cycle is established.
Now, if you have conditions were the carbon locked in organic matter can be exempted from this cycle (e.g. locking it into deep sea sediments), you would continuously remove CO2 from the atmosphere, resulting in a cooling climate.

Also, water is not a stable greenhouse gas. It infact precipates out of the atmosphere in a matter of days and is very dependant on ambient temperature.
So tell me, how has the earth not been baked to death the moment the first water molecule turned into water vapour? And how do you reach temperatures high enough in the first place to evaporate water to unlock its function as a greenhouse gas? e.g. during both superglaciation events (""snowboll earth"")."

This noise is actually a signal or process‚Äîone with a power spectral density that is inversely proportional to the frequency.
try to find on Google any physical  process which does not exhibit flicker (1/f) noise. Flicker noise is not a subject of logic or debate, it is inexplicable, and simply exists as hard science. the sun's output, from a very large-scale and complex process, meets the criteria for 1/f noise. in an eclipse the sun's output at some spot on earth goes close to zero. a candle flame does the same. the human heart rate, ditto.

Your farmers may well be able to plant more, but the crops will rot before they yield fruit. Besides, what will they water them with, as droughts get consistently more severe? And where will they plant them? There'll be less ice, sure. But less ice means less land as sea levels rise.

Both glaciation, and Greenhouse Heating reinforce their feedback loops through Albedo.  For example, Ice/Snow is a lot more reflective than Water.  So, as the ice caps melt, and the ocean levels rise, there's more open water, and less snow to absorb sunlight, and re-emit it as Infrared.  (The frequencies that CO2, and Methane absorb)  Conversely, during ice-ages, sea levels drop, and glaciers expand, reflecting more light, and absorbing less.  ""Positive,"" and ""Negative"" have positive, and negative associations, to popular science audiences.  Of course, they also mean something scientifically, for example in Thermodynamics, where Entropy tends to reinforce in a cascade failure.

If nearly everything was covered in thick forest/rainforest and a particularly bad global drought occurred (unlikely but anything is possible), in as little as a year even those rain forests would burn.

If everything is thick with trees from coast to coast, once they are burning (assuming they‚Äôve all been experiencing a drought) a fire could engulf entire continents within weeks.

Perhaps those fires were caused by volcanic activity (on a global scale) which had also caused reduced rainfall.

This is based on the Australian bush fires which were huge, unstoppable and that‚Äôs with human intervention and how our methods of living/farming create large firebreaks in of themselves. Imagine that but multiply it by all the area of a continent and multiply it by an even denser forestry."

Every time it gets to about 4 minutes, I have to put it on pause, so I can sit back and think about the two major, gigantic scientific points, that this video just Breezes right over, like it never happened.
Point one:
The host never talks about where the heat originates from, in the first place.
Which is the Sun.
Yes, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and it traps Heat.
But it only ever traps a specific amount, that's seemingly behaves like a set thermostat.
Which is why we are all alive today, and are able to even talk about this.
Point two:
Methane, and methane hydrate.
Yes methane is technically the most potent of all greenhouse gases.
But because methane oxidizes in the presence of oxygen, and then turns into carbon dioxide and water gone that it never gets a chance to be the most potent greenhouse gas.
Which leads us back to point number one, and the carbon dioxide misnomer.

"SABOtage Labs","2020-06-04T14:04:46Z","@Dundoril studies huh? Well, I know a couple of things. 1. Plants need to chemicals to flourish, basically. Nitrogen and CO2. As the plane began to come out of the last glacial period into what is now the interglacial period, CO2 was down to 150ppm. Plant life dies at 130ppm. Even today at 400ppm, they are still in starving mode. ""Studies"", research actually with empirical evidence shows that tree populations in America have not only rebounded in numbers from the colonial period but are in fact growing exponentially.  Advances in agricultural sciences have produced the highest crop yields in the history of time. More crops or food being produced on less land. The technology is only going to get better. 
2. ""Studies"" predicted the future rely on computer models as opposed to research in to the present or past that can use physical evidence. Computer models, especially in the area of say climate have been woefully bad. Not even close! It makes sense too. First, the data you put in determines what comes out. What we don't know about the incredibly complex system know as the planets climate can just about fill the Grand Canyon. There are so many data points, points we aren't even close to understanding that is hard to even consider them educated guesses. For instance, two of the most influential sources are the Sun and sun spot/solar output and clouds. It's nearly impossible to predict cloud formation and coverage 3 days out let alone 30 years. Add in to it about 100 other factors from oceans  currents to Saharan dust storms to volcanic activity and on and on and on and your model becomes an elaborate game of ""The Sims"". 
 Most importantly I know this. Relying in govts to fix something like the climate is not only the height of human conceit but just ridiculous. Their first idea is their only idea they ever have and that's tax...tax...tax! I'd much rather rely on human ingenuity and technology to continue what we have been doing. Treat our environment much more carefully and not be stupid about it like we have been in  the past and some countries still are. Scaring people with the world will end and the planet is dying isn't a fix. Taxes the poor and telling developing countries to stop developing will only compound problems. Hell. The greatest boom in life happened during the cambrian explosion when C02 was over 6000ppm. Granted, much different life but... we need carbon as much as we need oxygen. Carbon is the foundation of all life on this crazy amazing planet. A planet that will continue to spin and thrive for millions of years after our short time is up."
"Dundoril","2020-06-03T16:41:21Z","@SABOtage Labs basically all studies predict a decrease in drop yield overall..also some areas will see an increase... Not the us btw."

It's like going to a doctor's office and her talking doctor to you instead of breaking it down so you can understand. She's not smart because she can talk doctor, she is smart if she can translate doctor to English. 

Breaking down the complex so it can be understood simply. That's the sign of true intelligence and respect. Trying to make somebody conform to your understanding is the sign of neither.

Historically an increase in temperatures (often due to orbital forcing) lead to a de-gasing of  co2 from the oceans which in return increased temperatures even more (also due to possive feedback with water vapour)... That's why co2 is lacking the initial temperature increase."
"darthen856","2020-07-17T00:22:11Z","I guess it depends on definition. When most people hear ""the ice age"", they think of the Pleistocene epoch.

Using that definition, I'd like to keep living in this ice age, or many of our cities would end up under water."

(Another alotrope of Water)  Methane for several reasons:  First of all, there's various sources, as diverse as ruminants (Cattle) to rotting vegetation.  So, you have swamps being cleared for farmland (And drained) but then you have cattle turning crops into meat, manure, and Methane.  Also, Methane isn't stable in an oxygen rich atmosphere, so it tends to break down.  Into Carbon Dioxide, and Water Vapor."

"Mikael L√•ng","2020-07-08T22:07:13Z","Hi Pamela, I think we are struggling between fatalism and optimism here. On the other hand we can¬¥t do anything to avoid astronomic 	phenomenon. Then again those things happen in millions of years.  A lot of other things can and will happen in that time frame and probably humanity is quite something else if or when we get there. Actually diseases can act very rapidly as we have seen now with the corona, but let¬¥s not dig a hole for ourselves because of that either.
On the other hand I¬¥m thinking, why are we speeding up the process and make life harder for our children and also for animals and plants. We can and we should work together to avoid speeding it up. Everyone can do something. You don¬¥t have to switch from 100% polluting to 0% polluting in one big jump. Do it step by step. There is many options to start from. Recycling, warming up your house, what are you driving on, what are you buying in grocery store.
Remember also there is a lot of disinformation of pollution on the internet. Don¬¥t rely on social media claims. Try to find independent scientific researches. Look always for the funder of the research. If it¬¥s an oil-company or an energy-company don¬¥t trust it."

"Woodlands","2020-05-14T02:04:58Z","There is very much something we can do to alter climates. We are currently altering the global climate in at an EXTREME rate that is unparalleled in history outside of temporary ash coverings from volcanoes or asteroids and we do have carbon capture tech and other methods that could be employed en masse to make things colder.
It stands to reason that we can change it in whichever direction we want if we put our mind to it but since the forces of capitalism are driving us to do what is profitable the trend will be extreme warming that is faster than anything we would have to deal with naturally.
It will in all likelyhood get almost as bad as the thermal maximum and beyond if we keep going and don't change our terrible system of endless economic growth.
True if we had done nothing the earth would still change albeit very slowly. we might be experiencing cooling instead of warming but we wouldn't really notice much difference in our lives due to how slowly it would be happening. it would take MANY generations to notice and thus would be far easier to adapt to since plants and animals would adapt with us."

This irregular cycle which limits rainfall here has a drying effect. Coupled with aboriginal fire hunting techniques of millennia limited forest species to plants tolerant to being burnt often, which happened to coincide with trees that produced the most explosive fire fuels. These two things together make the east coast fires far more destructive than what they otherwise would be.  Plus, there is the fact that we unintentionally create fires just about every day. 
We haven't had fires for years now. Just non stop rain \ moist conditions. Symmetrically look at the US at this time in the cycle."

"Nan Anana","2020-02-11T01:14:20Z","Sigh~ So much wrong with this video... 1.) Looking at the overall trend, CO2 concentrations were actually FALLING throughout the Paleocene and the Eocene, from their most recent highs 50 million years earlier, in the Cretaceous. 2.) Global temperatures did rise (and also fall) in the Paleocene and continued to reverberate with swings up and down well into the Eocene, but per note 1, this was NOT caused by changes in CO2, but in fact happened DESPITE steadily falling CO2. This shows once again that CO2 and temperature have a very complicated (and much over estimated) relationship, which doesn't always follow a simple CO2 rise = temp. rise or even vice versa (although the reverse is actually more true). 3.) In the Eocene, CO2 concentrations were between 1 and 3 times higher than they are today, and according to this video, plants were supposedly unable to absorb this extra CO2; however, greenhouses today use concentrations 4 to 5 times more than the atmosphere and plants eat it up like they're starving, because they ARE starving. The reason is plants on earth originally evolved when there was over 17 times as much CO2 in the atmosphere, and plants begin to die off at about half the current atmospheric concentration. Bottom line, more CO2 is not hurting anything, plants love it, we eat plants, and most major civilization advances have come during times of food surplus (versus wars, disease and famine which come in cold times), therefore we should really be happy about this turn of events."
"Daniel M","2020-02-10T23:29:25Z","So in conclusion, you say we have no idea what caused or ended the PETM, the only thing we know for sure is that CO2 levels and temperatures were somewhat correlated. Yet you go on to say that increased CO2 today is definitely causing temperatures to rise, but you provide no evidence of this. Remember that correlation does not mean causation - an equally valid theory is that increased temperature causes higher CO2 levels, or that a third factor causes both. The only sure truths are that we don't fully understand how the climate works, that the climate has been changing for millions of years for reasons we don't understand, and that life is very adaptable and has survived."

I would love it if you guys would review his work.  He has spent over 50 years developing and teaching a successful way to re-green desert land.  His methods dramatically increase livestock production, reverse desertification, give struggling farmers back their livelihood, and have a powerful reversing effect on climate change.  It works in Africa, USA, Australia and all countries where advancing deserts are a problem.  In a nutshell, he simply gets the natural grassland eco system back in balance.  It's surprisingly simple, yet almost nobody knows about it.

I don‚Äôt know what is is but I always say if you thinking something is coming at you from the front, look behind you because that will get you first. Fact says that in the 1970s people were stating we were headed for another ice age, based on past observations. Well all of a sudden, no that is incorrect, we are going to burn up, drown from rising seas,become a bug infested earth and die from a bug bite.

"xchopp","2020-07-02T17:51:37Z","Great question. Many scientists think that the creation of the Himalayas by the Indian plate converging with the Eurasian plate just before the temperature trend reversed was what stopped the warming of the early Cenozioc and eventually resulted in the creation of an ice sheet on Antarctica (then, much later, Greenland) and then -- much later -- the orbitally-forced glacier/interglacial cycles at roughly 100,000-year intervals.¬†The uplift of massive areas of exposed rock and its weathering would have removed a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere,  reducing solar/greenhouse forcing and leading to cooling. The video above somehow missed this tectonic driver and posits only the azolla hypothesis -- but it is still great for placing our current situation in the context of what we know about the PETM: That is, global climate is strongly controlled by CO2 and CH4, with other GHGs, solar, orbital, and albedo secondary factors"

And then to state that no one knows why the planet cooled to a detrimental cold to all life that was on the planet, that global warming and the human effect on it is a falsity."

Leaving this planet will take several million years, assuming our species lasts that long.
There's plenty of time to plan and innovate but the sooner we start, the easier it will be.
Besides, we will need to begin mining asteroids quite soon since easy access to raw materials is already getting difficult.
It will be easier to mine asteroids than try to dig deeper into the planet to eek out what material we need to grow.
And it's unlikely we will stop growing in number. We need to put people some place.  Dyson space colonies are a good solution."

But regardless, what you're saying is that we should spend unusual amounts of resources and time on leaving the planet? 
We've only lived within the era of massive mechanical and technological development for half a millennium at best, literally shaping the world in to something it's never seen in it's hypothesized billions of years of existence and millions upon millions with life inhabiting it. But we should abandon ship because our actions as a civilization were inadequate and given enough foresight, and the people who acquired wealth and power from the misdeeds aren't willing to use that same wealth to turn things around? Because hundreds of millions of years down the road something we've always seen as inevitable will happen?
With the tech we have at hand very few would be able to leave this planet, and likely not survive in any meaningful way (where a civilization could spring forth as result of their actions) on any known stellar object, including mars. We do not have the means of terraforming planets yet. 
The only immediate danger we're in with regards to the sun, that i've seen, is we're overdo for a large solar flare event from happening again. That's only a danger in the sense that it cripples infrastructure as it's built now. Another problem addressing greed could concern. 
Allowing those who have done wrong by literally every living life form on the planet to continue doing so because there will be an eventual end is fruitless, with that same mindset we as animals should have never reproduced because we have a finite amount of time to continue ""kicking"" before the lights with regards to each and every individual. Things take time, and what you suggest takes more than most other ideas. While also harming more than it'd help.

The assessment doesn't take into account any likely variation in the sun's lifecycle as it ages.
Our sun could begin to fluctuate sooner in an unexpected manner or it could fool us and remain stable much longer.
But the over all theory aligns with current science.
So, we can do what we can for the relative near term to mitigate our climate problems, but in the end it won't stop the inevitable.

Care to display the evidence you have for your ""hiatus""?  There was a slight cooling period after WW2 as the debris of war in the atmosphere coupled with the debris of reindustrializing made an ""aerosol parasol"" from about 1940 to 1980.  That could constitute a ""hiatus"", but it's not the one that most ill-informed Deniers are referring to, is it?  You are trying to find one in the run up in GAST from 1980 to date.  Other than ordinary pauses before advances, there was no pause long enough to be considered a part of climate.  Climatary change is considered to have to occur over three sun cycles, or about 35 years at a minimum.  The longer, the more convincing.

Except that reality turned out to be somewhat worse than expected and we didn't realize until ~10 years ago that were will be tipping points where climate can start to change way faster than we knew before (like Methan from melting ice in Siberia). I had to google the Holdren stuff you mentioned and it seems to be from the 70's again. So decades before he got that science advisor position and at a time where climate simulations really just started. I don't know the details he wrote as I don't have that specific book, so I can't tell how wrong he really was (maybe just a warning about the extremes?). I didn't find anything about NASA predicting an ice free arctic, but I remember a few years ago the north-west passage in the arctic got mostly ice-free. Maybe you mean that? That actually happened. But sure - if you search enough along the fringes you'll probably find some scientific reports which go beyond the usual predictions. You'll have those guys in any field (and they have their important role as well as they often point out stuff people should check out more). The world mostly got greener thanks to India and China growing the forests again which they destroyed last century. Unfortunately Brasil hasn't learned that lesson yet..."
"wade5941","2020-01-21T02:45:44Z","@Michael Zeilfelder You don't have to go back that far. There are plenty of examples that are much more recent. One of my favorites is the prediction by NASA scientists of an ice free arctic by now. I really enjoyed the prediction by Obama's science advisor, John Holdren,  stating that global warming from CO2 could cause the deaths through starvation of as many as a billion people by 2020. There's no shortage and sadly there does not seem to be any professional repercussions to these frauds. One prediction fails and they just pump out another. Meantime the world just keeps getting greener. At least according to an article I read in the peer reviewed Science Journal. I wonder....has the world gotten greener with the small increase in CO2?"
"Michael Zeilfelder","2020-01-21T01:42:32Z","So you had to get back nearly half a century to find some documentary which got it wrong? Not a common opinion for climate experts even in the 70's, but maybe the documentary forgot to mention that. Also the computing power they had available was around a thousandth of what you got on your phone(!) today, so the simulations were a bit rougher back then."

During the late Ordovician early Silurian, around 439 million years ago, CO2 levels exceeded 2200 ppm, while the average temperature was about what it is today. From the Cretaceous to the Eocene 35 to 100 million years ago, a high temperature went with declining carbon dioxide.

The Solar flux is not constant, as the 11/22 yr sunspot cycle shows, and we seem to be in a Grand Solar minimum like last occurred 1645 - 1715, when the Earth was excessively cold. Should such a prolongued minimum occur now, it just might tip the climate into another Ice Age, since we do not know the cause of such events, nor how long they last."

Even if we continued pumping massive CO2 into the atmosphere for the next 500 years Earth would absolutely habitable. In fact, it would be even more so than it is today.

Of course, there have been times  in the earths history with a high carbon atmosphere and comparatively lower temperatures (than today), but more than just carbon content drives global temperatures.

"Yossarian","2019-12-24T23:44:03Z","@David Rooks Quite possibly all of that is true.

I'll have to do myself a favour and look it up, but I was previously under the impression that the industrial revolution started considerably earlier than 1970.

China and India both also distort the figures because they are enormous nations with enormous populations. It would be interesting to see your figures adjusted for a comparably sized nations with comparable growth rates. I do not know if there are figures calculated for CO2 emissions per person over time adjusting for the huge variation in population growth rates between nations over hundreds of years etc. That could be difficult to work out. I imagine if they were, developed countries would have much bigger relative footprints. Perhaps you know and can tell me?

Countries like the UK, Germany and USA have much smaller populations, and indeed had even smaller populations when they began the process of industrialisation, much earlier. That is why it has always been seen to be fairer, over the whole series of agreements, to allow less developed nations (even the big ones) more time to reduce their emissions than those countries that began industrial development a long time before them. Which seems reasonable to me.

I agree with you though that there are many problems with Paris and the other agreements, and with the carbon credits scheme as well."

"Karl Wheatley","2019-11-08T01:34:49Z","Nothing natural about it--we have pushed the climate far outside normal cyclical variations:


First, the problem under discussion isn‚Äôt generic ‚Äúclimate change,‚Äù it is man-made global warming and climate disruption. And speaking as a researcher studying this issue, the research is overwhelmingly clear that yes, humans burning fossil fuels is what caused the recent changes in the Earth's CO2 levels and temperatures--changes that go far outside the up-down-up-down-up-down natural variation that had been going on for 800,000 years. 

The last time the Earth warmed this rapidly, over 90% of life in the oceans and over 70% of life on land went extinct, including everything over 90 pounds. But this time, it‚Äôs US who has caused the rapid warming, so it‚Äôs our responsibility to take action to cool Earth back down. 

Overall, if you look across all the sciences and all the systems of the Earth, human activity is steadily destroying the Earth‚Äôs ability to support life, including human life. But I‚Äôll leave out the toxic chemicals and micro-plastics in our beer, drinking water, food, bodies, and rainfall, and just focus on man-made global warming and climate disruption. 

Global CO2 levels hadn‚Äôt been above 300 ppm for 800,000 years until humans started burning fossil fuels, and as a result, global mean temperatures have been getting hotter and hotter. Globally, EIGHT of the warmest ten years since we began keeping records happening in the last ten years!

https://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-10-hottest-global-years-on-record

July 2019 was the warmest month since they have been keeping records. Here are two illustrations of how global temps have been getting warmer:

https://giphy.com/gifs/global-warming-i3pSgAHSiUqhq

https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/long-term-warming-trend-continued-in-2017-nasa-noaa/

GLOBALLY, the 40s WERE warmer than the 1970s or other earlier decades, but since then, all hell started breaking loose, with the 80s being much warmer than any previous decade, the 90s being dramatically warmer than the 80s, the 2000s being warmer than any previous decade, and the 2010s so far beating all previous decades by a wide margin for warmest ever:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record

Here's how we know that burning fossil fuels and thus adding CO2 (and methane) to the atmosphere causes global warming and climate disruption. In 1827 Jean Baptiste Fourier first recognized the warming effect of greenhouse gases. In 1859, John Tyndall did the original research on the physical properties of CO2. In 1896, the first quantitative estimate of the effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 on the mean surface temperature of the Earth was made by Svante Arrhenius. In May, 1967, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences ""Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a given Distribution of Relative Humidity."" Manabe and Wetherald were the first to include all the main physical processes relevant to the problem, using a model that was no more complicated than necessary to achieve this. This led to much more realistic simulations and enabled the results to be explained in terms of processes which could be observed in the real world. Manabe and Wetherald made a number of other discoveries. First, the temperature of the stratosphere cooled markedly when carbon dioxide was doubled. This is the characteristic ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù of man-made global warming by burning fossil fuels: the troposphere warms and the stratosphere cools, with more thermal radiation at the wavelengths of CO2 and methane being kept in the lower atmosphere and less escaping into the stratosphere.  So, let's look at the actual science on that.

CO2 is TIGHTLY correlated with global temps and lots of research shows adding CO2 leads to temp rise. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/04/study-rising-co2-global-warming

Of course, the effect goes the other way too, as the Earth warms, the permafrost melts, more methane is released, that warms the Earth even more, so even more CO2 and methane are released (It‚Äôs a feedback loop, but this time around, we got the destructive ball rolling by burning fossil fuels).  

In 1982, Exxon accurately predicted global warming
https://skepticalscience.com/1982-exxon-accurate-prediction.html

The predictions from climate scientists from the 1980s and even 1970s and ones from the IPCC have  quite accurate, while the predictions of climate deniers like Lindzen were way off the mark. 
And various climate models have been quite accurate, especially when you factor in that they couldn't have predicted the 2008 global recession that slowed the world's economy and caused a dip in CO2 emissions.

planting a tree is a good idea and is benifishel in many ways, but has no longtherm impact on the CO2 level in the atmosphare.
After the tree died it will rrlease all the CO2 it prviously had collected.

"Starley Shelton","2022-01-15T06:01:08Z","@Suzanne Franklin I think we have reasons to be optimistic.

I wonder about that catastrophic word.  What is catastrophic for one group is opportunity for another.  Without the elimination of the dinosaurs mammals might never have become dominant.  5 billion years ago the planet itself was in early development and basically lifeless.  Instead of catastrophe it has been slowly stabilizing.  If you think about the fact 20 miles below this thin crust it is basically lava, you appreciate the miracle of any stability.

As far as tens of millions of years to recover, the planet has actually been shown to be quick to recover.  Whether Chernoble or the last ice age much recovery can and does take place in mere decades or centuries.  Even the extinction event wiping out the dinosaurs and pretty much the planet only took an estimated 30,000 years to planet wide recovery.  And that was basically a scorched earth event."

"Michael Deierhoi","2019-11-29T08:46:05Z","@busty. As a climate warmed at the end of an ice age that is true.  Milankovitch Cycles are the trigger for starting and stopping glacial periods.  When the Milankovitch cycles switch to allowing more sunlight to reach the earth the atmosphere begins to warm which in turn causes the oceans to warm.  As the oceans warm over hundreds of years CO2 is released back into the atmosphere which AMPLIFIES the warming into the Interglacial period.  

But when the climate is warming like it is now and there is a high concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere most CO2 goes INTO the ocean.   And that has to the with physics of the partial pressure of CO2 being higher in the atmosphere then the ocean.  Most CO2 entering the oceans converts to carbonic acid, carbonate or bicarbonate."

It is interesting that violent and chaotic temperature changes occurred during this recent event, but I don't see much discussion related to it. We're talking temperature swings in excess of 10 deg centigrade over a mere 300 year interval. I just found it odd that he focused on 56 million years ago when we have much more recent examples of warm climates within a mere 10,000 years. But, it is his video and he can do and say what he wants. The climate is not and never has been stable so I doubt very much that things will stay as they are.

So the ocean ""die-off"" couldn't be due to increased CO2 in the water but maybe to a CO2 shortage denying phytoplankton an essential nutrient.


Then your so many million tons of CO2 produced. Only SIX PER CENT of this is produced by humans!
Finally, the ice core records show that atmospheric CO2 increases are an EFFECT of global warming, not a cause; i.e. first the temperature goes up and THEN CO2 increases.
You'll have to find some other cause for your warming. Try the sun - that usually works.

I hate when they use the last hundred years graph. If you look closely at the temperature fluctuations during all the warming periods and break them down into hundred year periods you can support a whole range of possibilities. What they are not making clear is that we are currently near the top of the warming period. But not at the top. These temperature changes can be found in the Milankovitch cycles and glaciation. Please research for yourself. The Milankovitch cycles show what is happening and what has happened."
"koczisek","2019-10-03T15:15:57Z","Very informative with 2 exceptions: 1. there's no prove CO2 is that cause of warming - CO2 change FOLLOWS the temp. change and regular H2O vapor is 3-4x more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, 2. we aren't informed properly and do not realize at all, that we live in an INTERGLACIAL, a dozen thousand of years from another GLACIAL. Without realizing this we live on borrowed time, because transition into glacial is steep and seems unstoppable. Once we're in glacial, given that globally understood ""civilization"" will survive the 1st freezing, the climate will offer us several INTERSTADIALS, but after each of them diving deeper into STADIALS with temp. still plunging down and squeezing from us everything we've got for our survival.
The best quotes from Wiki: ""Generally, stadials endure for a thousand years or less, and interstadials for less than ten thousand years, while interglacials last for more than ten thousand and glacials for about one hundred thousand"" & ""Work by Berger and Loutre suggests that the current warm climate may last another 50,000 years. The amount of heat trapping gases being emitted into Earth's Oceans and atmosphere may delay the next glacial period by an additional 50,000 years"".
Fg 100 thousand years of progressive freezing PPL - that's CHALLENGING!! - think about it!
Given the 1st quote and knowing that we're already 12,000 years into our cosy interglacial I think that ""Berger and Loutre"" may be at least 10-20 thousand years off with their prediction in the best scenario and in the worst we may have only a few thousand years left. So, eventually, perhaps we should start recognizing the true ""climate change"" and working out the true cause of it, instead of yelling at the ultimate villain CO2, just because having no Fg idea makes us find a scapegoat. Perhaps we'll find a way of preventing glacial slope and perhaps releasing some greenhouse gases is that thing - just perhaps, because, like I said, I'm not convinced this will have any significant effect. According to the 2nd sentence of 2nd quote, it'd at least give us twice the time to think, study and act. Perhaps we won't find ANY viable and SAFE solution to this problem and we'll just have to PREPARE and ADAPT, what I think is what we SHALL do. After all we're here because we adapted to all changes, not prevented them. We SHALL NOT tinker with delicate planetary- and cosmic-scale equilibriums and equations - if we do, basing on my to-date knowledge and experience, we're gonna Fk everything up completely and end up killing, instead of saving ourselves and causing unspecified additional collateral. The nature will CRUSH us like miserable bugs or like sea crushes overproud seafarers, who tried to force their luck.
So PPL - temp. rises - ADAPT!, CO2 level rises - ADAPT!, water level rises - ADAPT!

And now the climate nuts of today are saying we have 12 years left till the end of the earth. Do you happen to know whether that's 12 years 3 months or 4 months? Days? So my question is if it takes 20,000 years to warm like it did before why is everybody with an agenda screaming cataclysmic doom in 12 years?  Humans were swinging in the trees 20,000 years ago. Humans and technology is advancing at a pace that far, far outstrips carbon accumulation which is less and less in the United States.

So how is adding more CO2 going to trap more energy?  The data that CO2 levels  track with atmospheric temperature doesn't consider that warming oceans will outgas CO2 as their ability to hold dissolved gas decreases, and there's a LOT more CO2 in the oceans than in the atmosphere.

Assuming the theories of human evolution are true, we will also evolve and adapt to what nature has to provide for us and how it changes. We have a mutual exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen with the plants around us. We breathe in what they breathe out, and they breathe in what we breathe out. Climate activists fail to understand that we are all carbon based lifeforms. Complaining about the carbon footprint is ignorant. If we reduce carbon dioxide, plants will suffer and will end up causing us to suffer because the plants help to provide the oxygen we breathe.

"Karl Wheatley","2019-11-08T01:58:37Z","But warming this rapid causes mass extinctions. 
First, the problem under discussion isn‚Äôt generic ‚Äúclimate change,‚Äù it is man-made global warming and climate disruption. And speaking as a researcher studying this issue, the research is overwhelmingly clear that yes, humans burning fossil fuels is what caused the recent changes in the Earth's CO2 levels and temperatures--changes that go far outside the up-down-up-down-up-down natural variation that had been going on for 800,000 years. 

The last time the Earth warmed this rapidly, over 90% of life in the oceans and over 70% of life on land went extinct, including everything over 90 pounds. But this time, it‚Äôs US who has caused the rapid warming, so it‚Äôs our responsibility to take action to cool Earth back down. 

Overall, if you look across all the sciences and all the systems of the Earth, human activity is steadily destroying the Earth‚Äôs ability to support life, including human life. But I‚Äôll leave out the toxic chemicals and micro-plastics in our beer, drinking water, food, bodies, and rainfall, and just focus on man-made global warming and climate disruption. 

Global CO2 levels hadn‚Äôt been above 300 ppm for 800,000 years until humans started burning fossil fuels, and as a result, global mean temperatures have been getting hotter and hotter. Globally, EIGHT of the warmest ten years since we began keeping records happening in the last ten years!

https://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-10-hottest-global-years-on-record

July 2019 was the warmest month since they have been keeping records. Here are two illustrations of how global temps have been getting warmer:

https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/long-term-warming-trend-continued-in-2017-nasa-noaa/

GLOBALLY, the 40s WERE warmer than the 1970s or other earlier decades, but since then, all hell started breaking loose, with the 80s being much warmer than any previous decade, the 90s being dramatically warmer than the 80s, the 2000s being warmer than any previous decade, and the 2010s so far beating all previous decades by a wide margin for warmest ever:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record

Here's how we know that burning fossil fuels and thus adding CO2 (and methane) to the atmosphere causes global warming and climate disruption. In 1827 Jean Baptiste Fourier first recognized the warming effect of greenhouse gases. In 1859, John Tyndall did the original research on the physical properties of CO2. In 1896, the first quantitative estimate of the effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 on the mean surface temperature of the Earth was made by Svante Arrhenius. In May, 1967, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences ""Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a given Distribution of Relative Humidity."" Manabe and Wetherald were the first to include all the main physical processes relevant to the problem, using a model that was no more complicated than necessary to achieve this. This led to much more realistic simulations and enabled the results to be explained in terms of processes which could be observed in the real world. Manabe and Wetherald made a number of other discoveries. First, the temperature of the stratosphere cooled markedly when carbon dioxide was doubled. This is the characteristic ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù of man-made global warming by burning fossil fuels: the troposphere warms and the stratosphere cools, with more thermal radiation at the wavelengths of CO2 and methane being kept in the lower atmosphere and less escaping into the stratosphere.  So, let's look at the actual science on that.

CO2 is TIGHTLY correlated with global temps and lots of research shows adding CO2 leads to temp rise. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/04/study-rising-co2-global-warming

Of course, the effect goes the other way too, as the Earth warms, the permafrost melts, more methane is released, that warms the Earth even more, so even more CO2 and methane are released (It‚Äôs a feedback loop, but this time around, we got the destructive ball rolling by burning fossil fuels).  

In 1982, Exxon accurately predicted global warming
https://skepticalscience.com/1982-exxon-accurate-prediction.html

The predictions from climate scientists from the 1980s and even 1970s and ones from the IPCC have  quite accurate, while the predictions of climate deniers like Lindzen were way off the mark. 
And various climate models have been quite accurate, especially when you factor in that they couldn't have predicted the 2008 global recession that slowed the world's economy and caused a dip in CO2 emissions.

Climate scientist James Hansen's predictions have been quite accurate while climate denier Lindzen's predictions have been wildly off the mark.

And here are multiple forms of evidence on the 97% consensus on man-made global warming
https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm

On a more basic level, when scientists have labeled a class of substances as ""greenhouse"" gases because they help hold heat from the sun in the atmosphere (Earth would be 59 degrees F cooler if now for those gases), isn't it pretty obvious that when humans start adding more of those gases to the atmosphere, things will get warmer? In physics, actions have consequences. 

At the moment, human-caused global warming and climate disruption (aided by chemical and plastic pollution and deforestation) are steadily pushing the point where ecosystems will collapse and human civilization and the human population will collapse with them. I wish it weren't true, but it is. However, there are hundreds of solutions for healing the ecosystems and cooling the planet back to a healthier temperature, but we need to be willing to take action.

Also, if the climate science theories are wrong, why are their models so accurate?
In 1982, Exxon accurately predicted global warming
https://skepticalscience.com/1982-exxon-accurate-prediction.html

The predictions from climate scientists from the 1980s and even 1970s and ones from the IPCC have  quite accurate, while the predictions of climate deniers like Lindzen were way off the mark. 
And various climate models have been quite accurate, especially when you factor in that they couldn't have predicted the 2008 global recession that slowed the world's economy and caused a dip in CO2 emissions.

Ya'll catch what I did there....I mentioned Re-usable bags twice.....so even though people are saying we can use another product we should really be using re-usable bags....so the root cause isn't what people were thinking at either time....in the 80s and 90s ""Paper bags kill trees we need to stop using those and use plastic!""......or now ""Plastic is bad for the oceans and land fills we should go back to using paper bags""........Re-usable is best....and why the hell are we not recycling as much as we used to? what happened to that big push huh?

The amount of disinformation being spread gets people confused and gives them a chance to believe what they want to believe. Soooo many scientists have worked on this issue and most report on an incredible amount of species dying, biospheres being altered and temperatures rising. If you don't listen to scientists then listen to indigenous people who rely on nature to supply them. In the end it will likely be our ignorant attitiude that will cost billions of lives all over the world. Outsourcing natural disaster won't work as well as outsourcing wars though and in the end it will backfire.

Then he talks about positive feedbacks which we do know from past history that there have never been a runaway positive fastback. So we don't know what caused the PTEM to warm and then we don't know why it cooled.... but mans CO2 is going to send us to hell.... you know the Less than 4% of the 400ppm of CO2 of which CO2 and the other greenhouse gases form less than 5% of the greenhouse effect as Water Vapour does the heavy lifting of the other 95%.

Guess what, you get more snow (when it snows) when you have a hotter biosphere.  I can explain that to you if you can't figure it out.
Now you can explain why Greenland is losing an average of 200 BiLLION TONS of ice every year.  This has been going on for about two decades.  Then you can explain the trend in Antarctica where it loses about 84 billion tons of ice per year, year after year.  And why the GAST is rising at an exponential rate, with no sign of slowing, which would have to happen if there was going to be any chance of the trend reversing.

As the Country has gone from Apx. 95% Faming to an industrial, Urbanized economy with farmland/farming dropping to only Apx. 3% of the Economy.  Although we produce more food crops than 100 years ago.

When European‚Äôs first showed up in the Eastern Coast it was so covered by forest it was said that a Squirrel üêø could travel from Eastern Canada to Florida without ever touching the ground.  A Natural fungus destroyed all of the American Elms üå≥. Now all that You will find of those trees are semi-rotted stumps that are still living but the trees can‚Äôt grow any taller;  As for the midwestern prairies, there are now more trees and growth as historically the Native people of the those lands not only did not try to interfere with the natural fires but regularly started fires to keep the land in Prairie with the only trees mainly along the riparian areas along the streams.
America now has more forest areas since the Heat waves of the 1930‚Äôs than at any time in the last hundred odd Years!"

It happened before that spike in warming. The questions is HOW it happened, not if. CO2 is our best clue if for nothing else because anyone who cares to look can see a similar warming happening now as CO2 goes into the atmosphere.

The Younger Dryas (c. 12,900 to c. 11,700 years BP) was a return to glacial conditions which temporarily reversed the gradual climatic warming after the Last Glacial Maximum started receding around 20,000 BP.

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was the most recent time during the Last Glacial Period that ice sheets were at their greatest extent. Vast ice sheets covered much of North America, Northern Europe, and Asia and profoundly affected Earth's climate by causing drought, desertification, and a large drop in sea levels.

you said not global?"

"Michael Deierhoi","2019-11-29T08:10:47Z","It is true the Polar Ice Caps have been gone for probably most of earth's history and have only become more present in the last 34 million years since the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch.   This video focuses particularly on the PETM when there was no polar ice caps.  And during the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene the ice caps did not retreat completely.  At that time the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica opened up allowing the Antarctica Circumpolar Current to flow unobstructed which turned the South pole into the ice cap it is today.  The Arctic Ice Cap formed later also due to geographic configurations closer to todays. 

 The Arctic Ice Cap is declining today because of accelerated warming in the Arctic due to the GHG concentration being almost 50% higher then it was throughout the previous 10,000 years!   Prior to that time it was as low as 190 ppm during glaciation."

"T V","2019-12-15T01:51:40Z","@kim weaver cognition does begin to be affected until 2000 to 5000 ppm. we are increasing around an average of 2 ppm per year. we are currently at 400 ppm. assuming rates remain constant and we do not evolve to handle increasing levels of co2 or invent gas filters (which we already have) it would take 800 - 2300 years for cognition to even begin to be affected. Even if we do reach these levels and temperatures increase, its illogical to assume that humans can't develop technology to protect us and animals we deem necessary for our survival. we have gas and air filters, and we have a/c. all we need to do is produce them on a large scale and create enclosed healthy environments.

Architects of our own destruction, put that glass of kool-aid down. The fact is that in terms of anthropogenic forcings since the industrial age began, the contribution to atmospheric CO2 has been minor compared to natural forcings. 

Let's look at the oceans, how can CO2 warm the oceans? Infrared or IR emission occurs in 360 degrees after a collision event with a water vapor molecule or CO2 molecule.  Half of that emission will be downward, but only 1/360th will be vertically downward.  Half of the radiation emitted is directed away from the earth‚Äôs surface, half towards earth‚Äôs surface.  If that water molecule or CO2 molecule is close to the surface, the IR emission from the molecule could reach the water or soil.  There is no wave guide or other physical phenomena to direct the radiation one way or another.

Now besides that CO2 emits LWIR at a very short range of primarily 15 microns. In fact, an ice cube emits at 10 microns which is about 50% ""hotter"" than the emittion of a CO2 Molecule and as hard as it would be to warm the atmosphere with ice cubes it's even harder to warm the atmosphere with CO2.

In fact, there is more correlation between the increase of Postage and temperatures than there is between the rise of CO2 and temperatures."

Maybe that'll be really great after the boreal forest completely burns and turns into a rainforest again, but the same machine has innumerable other devastating side effects for the environment our lives depend upon, like mercury in the Amazon, oceans turning into plastic goop, or the way an awful lot of the surface water is horribly contaminated and its safe consumption eventually devolves on‚Äìyou guessed it‚Äìprocesses powered by fossil fuels.

scientists told us that the planets began to circle the sun after it formed and slowly while circling the sun began to move ever so slightly closer to the star itself. the planet called mercury became the hottest planet as it is the closest and all the planets are moving closer to the sun each year making them warmer. of course, a tax will not change this. unless scientists find a way to reverse the pull of gravity. which they cant, the planets will slowly move closer to the sun until they are consumed by it.¬†


in short, science has proven that the earth is being warmed by the sun and getting warmer each year as it moves closer to it and therefore science proved that the earth has never been warmer than it is today. only colder and less inhabitable and we should be looking for ways to move to a cooler planet instead of making up tall tales about warming cycles. but that is just my opinion and i am entitled to it. although it is based on scientific fact."

But if you look at it over a longer period of time, those spikes and dips even out, and the rises and falls appear to be slower. I wonder if maybe when we study the climate 50 million years ago if we're only able to see longer period trends rather than spikes and dips over short intervals of time. Maybe the reason it looks like the earth is warming so quickly right now is because we're only looking at a very short interval of time--the last 100 years. This could just be a quick spike that, if we looked at things over a longer period of time, would even out. Maybe spikes like this have been common in the past, but we can't know because we can only see things over larger intervals. I mean if there were little dramatic spikes and dips during the heating that happened 50 million years ago, would we be able to detect it?"

The interglacials, each about 10 000 years of duration, have consisted in warmings and coolings, warmings and coolings. Last cooling apart from the present one, took place in the middle ages.

"Joe Wood","2019-09-04T08:47:49Z","Forget about global warming,  think about the laws of physics,  and how it applies to this planet we live on.

 One Pacific law of physics that plainly states,   You cannot endlessly put something into something that is not endless.

 For if you try to do so you will destroy that limited space.  

 How can the human race claims that it is an intelligent species,  when it hasn't the intelligence to understand where it lives nor does it have the  intelligence to work out how to live there without destroying this limited space and of course along with itself.

 You can come back with all the crap you like,  the fact is I keep repeating you cannot endlessly put something into something that is not endless.

 What's laughable about you what out their, is that you prove this to yourself every single day of your life.

 From when you're making yourself a drink,  you recognise the limited space of the cup so it doesn't overflow,  the same with the fuel tank of your car, your shopping trolley, putting people in your car and any other vehicle or building you come across you recognise all these limited spaces and that you cannot endlessly cram people or items into them because they are limited spaces.

 So why is it when it comes to the limited space of the landmass you live on and the planet that landmass is situated on,  all of a sudden you are unable to understand or grasp this simple law of physics.

 Why is that?,   because you are not as intelligent as you claim to be that's  why,   your  obsession to endlessly multiply and destroy is the behaviour of one lifeform which is a virus.

 Because a virus only goal is to attach itself to a host spread through the host endlessly multiplying and destroying the  host until that host is dead a long of course with itself.

 But before the virus reaches this end, it tries to send its seed  of to another host so it can carry on endlessly multiplying and destroying from host to host.

 that's the behaviour of the human species,  you are desperately trying to colonise another world, so you can spread your disease across the universe.

 When you look up at Mars  we are starting to realise  it was a living planet  millions of years ago,  but for some strange reason it died,  that is because we came upon it and destroyed it,  from there we came to here, scientists are starting to realise that life on Earth might have came from Mars. 

 When we look up at Mars,we are looking at our own handiwork and if we do not change our ways and become as intelligent as we claim to be,  then  this beautiful planet will go the same way as Mars  a dead planet. 


The damning evidence of all to show that the human species is not an intelligent species is in the fact.

 Nothing intelligent would behave in such a way that it actions would  bring harm, in danger or destroy its own environment,  the very thing it relies on to give it  air so it can breathe exist.   only a virus will destroy itself."

If so then you are comparing two entirely different phenomena taking place on excruciatingly different time scales. That's like saying, ""I can stand outside in -10 degree weather for 5 minutes without dying, so I must be able to stand outside for 5 YEARS in -10 degree weather too!""

They are interchangeable to some..example ""i have a 'theory' that if we just all simultaneously open our freezers worldwide for exactly 5 hours, it will cool the planet back down and we will be saved"" lol  A theory is when repeated results are published challenging all...achem ALL lol..of the scientist that qualify in the field(as well as any1 else who wants to try) to devise experiments that are designed to try to disprove the published result. After none are able to conclusively disprove the findings and all accumulated data show the same repeated results...we then have no alternative then to say this is fact.Though the buck doesn't stop there, that would be lazy science. As technology, understanding, and the scientific method itself advance, so too do scientist(and non-scientist) try to find new and creative ways to disprove the standing theory.  A well formed theory lol. If you were trying to sound smart, it was an epic fail. A hypothesis is kinda sorta like a guess but really more like an estimation based on existing information that is seemingly pointing to a conclusion. By the time something is called a theory it has been tested and scrutinized for who knows how long by who knows how many and the same results(from different and unique experiments), but i mean that doesnt make it fact right? lol You probably just know better, or is that all of your years of research and experimentation have concluded that the original hypothesis was incorrect and new data your new data has succeeded where the entire scientific community has failed and you've proven that global warming is what?....Just a guess.

That's what I'm arguing. We don't actually know that greenhouse gases are the cause. We do know that temps follow the Earth's eccentricity well. Swings of 10 degrees are seen as the norm. We do know that temps correlate nearly perfectly with CO2. But we haven't ruled out that higher temps lead to higher CO2 concentrations. Is it cause and effect, or effect and cause?
I remember as a kid they said that African would dry out. Zimbabwe became the breadbasket and destroyed itself with good intentions(socialism). Meanwhile, the poorest people in the world(sub-saharan Africans) have seen their land get more rainfall(https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.6023). Then we had a hole in the ozone and lots of people panicked and started wearing sunscreen. The hole is healed and we still wear sunscreen.
We likely agree on the problems. We just don't agree on the solutions. The biggest problem facing us is sea level rise in the next 50 years. I'll probably live to see it. When I was born, no one dared cross the northwest passage. When I die, teenagers will sail through it.
The real question is: What is the ideal global mean temp? Is it 0C? -5C? 5C?"
"John Coviello","2019-09-12T03:51:55Z","From reading comments like this one, I see a lot of people commenting here need to do research to understand what actually drives the Earth's climate changes like ice ages and warm periods.  The sun plays a big role, but only one that changes the direction of global temperatures.  It is the increasing or decreasing concentration of global warming gases that ultimately send the Earth into an ice age period or a warm period."

"Cornelius Maze-Eye","2019-09-10T13:48:09Z","The Sun only drives the climate, it doesn't dictate composition of the atmosphere directly. The climate only forms off the interaction from the Sun's energy on the current atmospheric composition. The variable of the sun is fairly consistent even across it's 11 year cycle, so where the widest variation come from is the composition of the atmosphere. We can't affect the sun's output, but we can the atmosphere's composition. Changing that changes the way the Sun's energy interacts with the climate.
Obviously it's more complicated than that, which is why we have some people spend years studying and researching this. i.e. Climatologists, Geologists, Physicists, etc."

The greenhouse effect is not just based on correlations and unproven assumptions; it's a well-established fact of radiation that's verified by experiment. Yes, there are complicated feedback mechanisms and other factors like solar activity, but taking all that into account, industrial CO2 emissions are the most likely cause of global warming OF THE LAST CENTURY (no one's claiming CO2 was behind all climate change ever in earth's history.) That is the consensus of many climate models based on fundamental physics, not correlations. Yes the models aren't perfect, but they are the best tool we have for explaining the past and predicting the future. Check out the papers compiled in the book ""The Warming Papers: The Scientific Foundation for the Climate Change Forecast."" If you have equally strong evidence to refute that huge body of science, please share. 

Also, if you're skeptical that 0.04% of the atmosphere could have any impact, remember that 0.04% is halfway to the legal driving limit of blood alcohol content. Look at the effect that has on your body. This is only an analogy of course, but it shows you can't always just dismiss as negligible any fraction as low as 0.04%."

He briefly mentioned methane but moves back to carbon as the big boogie man that will cause our end. Methane IS the main reason for accelerated warming but not the engine that gets it rolling. Mapping the Sun's activities with solar system temperature variations has shown that what kicks off warmer planetary temperatures is the Sun itself. Carbon is essential for life on this planet for without it plants and plankton would have nothing to breath and they produce oxygen for us to breath. And I'm sure that anyone who's watched any amount of science fiction has heard this phrase ""we are a carbon based life form"". Carbon is a byproduct of spent energy, when something burns it releases carbon. That said we are being bombarded with carbon from space by enormous solar furnaces, and not just our own.

I guess then the increased surface area of seawater from the melted ice caps, reflecting more solar energy away from the planet in the poles, probably would expedite further, an already open invitation, in the absence of warming flow from the tropical regions, arriving in polar waters, for a rapid arctic and sub-arctic re-freeze that would have much farther reaching dominion over the essentially stagnated oceans' area of planetary real estate..

and that missing factor is what Einstein wrote a paper on called ""Thermodynamic Equilibrium"" which shows that if the atmosphere is in a state of ""Thermodynamic Equilibrium"" (which it is today & can be confirmed by decades of weather balloon records) that the greenhouse effect can not occur.


that means regardless how much Co2 & other greenhouse gasses are dumped into the atmosphere, by humans or nature, it will not produce global warming from greenhouse effect as long as the atmosphere is in a state of ""Thermodynamic Equilibrium"".



so the bottom line is if the heat is not where its supposed to be (in the upper atmosphere trapped by greenhouse gasses) the theory is flawed & the surface warming is from sources other than ""greenhouse effect"", its just that simple."

"Jeff Waller","2019-09-01T20:24:16Z","Here's something that I'll just throw out here for public consumption:

The Earth has certain magnetic properties, both deep within and at the surface. The surface magnetism gives us our North and South poles. Who knows what the true strength of the deeper fields might be, but without doubt they exist.

Magnets, when passed repeatedly and rapidly over a section of copper have the strange effect of generating heat. Copper, rotated rapidly enough through a strong magnetic field, can be heated to such a degree as to melt it.

Why would we not expect metals in the earth's core moving through earth's magnetic fields to heat up? If they do, why would that heat not transfer to the surface eventually.

No one can argue that the earth's core, crust, and magma do not continually move in relation to each other. Massive mineral deposits of copper, gold, silver, etc. passing within a concentrated magnetic field would heat the Earth!

Is this the reason for this ancient warming and the current warming? If so, the best thing we could hope to do to combat it would be to find ways the convert that heat to mechanical energy perhaps by geothermal devices.

Just saying..."

It had nothing to do with carbon as we know that by testing , the energy came from a unknown source or change !
Carbon was much higher in past epochs of tropical climates !

"Proteus Augustus","2019-09-01T14:05:45Z","The process you can't see or prove in the geological record is nevertheless deducible based on current understanding of solar cycles. The sun most likely went into an extreme hot cycle which started the positive feedback loop of  methane and co2 release. The up ticked solar cycle didn't have to last long to start the feedback loop and could maintain the warming at lower radiation emissions. Once the sun cycled down to a minima that couldn't maintain the temperature insulation provided by the gas blanket and cooling occurred because of thermodynamic conductivity constants of gases. Once cooling started, the earth equilibrated to accommodate thermoconductivity."

CO2 was released from the oceans at the end of the glacial cycle because the Milankovich Cycles changed to allow more sun light to reach the earth.  As the earth land and atmosphere warmed so too did the oceans which caused the release of CO2 back into the atmosphere.   But now the CO2 in the atmosphere has a higher partial pressure because of the higher concentration.  410 ppm now vs 280 ppm before the industrial era began.  

That higher partial pressure of CO2 continues to add CO2 to the ocean and most CO2 in the ocean is converted to carbonic acid which makes the oceans more acidic and bicarbonate and carbonates used by molluscs.  And humans are also adding CO2 much faster then even happened during the PETM when it took 20,000 years given much life time to adapt or evolve."

"DavefMCT","2019-08-31T18:45:17Z","The Eocene was NOT the last time the globe warmed.¬† It LAST warmed after the last full glaciation (ice age).¬† During the present interglacial, the Holocene, the Climate Optimum warm event consisted of increases of up to 4¬†¬∞C higher than today¬†at the North Pole.¬† The climatic optimum occurred during the Subboreal (5 to 2.5 ka BP, which corresponds to 3000 BC‚Äì500 BC) and Atlanticum (9 to 5 ka, which corresponds to roughly 7000 BC‚Äì3000 BC). Our current climatic phase following this climatic optimum is still within the same interglacial (the Holocene). That warm period was followed by a gradual decline until about 2000 years ago, with another warm period until the Little Ice Age (1250‚Äì1850)."

The earth is sometimes closer to the sun and other times farther away (centrifugal and centripetal force)  The closer we are to the sun, the warmer our planet gets.  The polar caps store fresh water and release it as we warm.  This causes the ocean currents to diminish, stopping flow and warmth from the equator toward the pols.  As this happens, the polls cool down and start collecting moisture.  Because the polls are cooler, the precipitation doesn't melt and collects, lowering the ocean levels and causing the ocean currents to start up again because of the spin of the earth.  This wax and wane has been going on since the earth first formed and it will continue long after humans are absent from the planet."

We do not know how or why, but  there is a lot of evidence to substantiate this.  That is real climate change in a drastically short period of time. The more I study science, the more I realise we know very little. It is pure hubris to imply we know what effects climate and what is ""normal"" we keep finding evidence that advanced humans are far older a species than we once believed."
"Kenrick Leiba","2019-08-30T21:20:14Z","Nor Cal Scooters well it was the massive release of CO2 that warmed the planet. 

And yes 400 parts per million makes a huge difference. The reason our earth is habitable is because the atmosphere keeps it warm. Each different gas lets through a difference part of the spectrum and traps difference radiation. Even though water is also a greenhouse gas it is also at capacity as far as the amount of heat it traps and is cycles pretty quickly. Excess CO2 stays in the atmosphere for a thousand years and accumulates (if the cycles is no being added to it is in equilibrium in the biosphere). 

When you have a bit more heat being trapped than what is being re-radiated it can has a pretty big effect on overall heat. 

It isn‚Äôt like climate scientists don‚Äôt know there have been previously climate cycles. It is that they have tested to see if the thing that caused those previous warming period apply now - they don‚Äôt. We can also say how much heat a volcano emits and how much that should warm the earth. Heat is totally energy, temperature is average energy. A volcano is hot but it terms of the heat it adds to the whole atmosphere it is tiny. The gases they emit have a larger effect. Currently, as the video says we are emitting far more CO2 per year than has ever been emitted naturally. We are also warming faster. Those are facts, they don‚Äôt suddenly change just because you don‚Äôt understand physics."
"Nor Cal Scooters","2019-08-30T18:20:26Z","c02 makes up .04 % of the atmosphere and your sure that has more of an impact than volcanoes and world wide fires ? you know there was a time when Earth was an Ice ball, and it was volcanoes they melted the ice ."

water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom....which makes it a molecule ...one molecule  is what we call vapor....it is only when a bunch of those molecules start clinging together  that it is liquid 
the reason this is important is because H2O doesnt act like you think it does...because as it evaporates and becomes a vapor those molecules separate again

now then...to the climate part
every cooling system has a certain amount of coolant that is need to keep it at optimum temperature...earth is no different
for instance take 2 pots of water...one 1/4 full and one all full.....heat them up at the same temperature.....the one that is 1/4 full heats up faster makes steam (humidity) faster

same for the earth ...since all this water is being put in stored containers ...it is not circulated .....less H2O molecules in the air....they cant combine to make  liquid that can circulate

right now there are the same amount of H2O molecules on earth as there were in the beginning, so no, those molecules are not gone...they havent went into space....the reason they are gone is because we put them in sealed containers

so if we deal with the water shortages ....water in sealed containers......then we can deal with the climate heating up

or we can just wait till some of the ice is melted....yup

because H2O as a solid doesnt circulate or evaporate till it is melted....once it is melted a little...the ground water and the heat index temps will be back to normal

as I said...this is unrefined, I wrote it in a hurry to reply to a USA TODAY video on water disappearing

I have this idea in my head and cant get it out in a coherent way for most people to understand...yes it goes way out there, but it is something that no one else is addressing , the water levels around the globe have decreased.....look at california, all the reservoirs.....michigan residents have stated that nestle has made their ground water drop in their rivers and streams.....there are documentaries on this 

I wish someone would actually look at this because I'm certain this is a big deal

but as I said...we can just wait for the polar caps to melt and replenish the H2O molecules that are able to circulate
remember...H2O is just a molecule until it combines with another H2O molecule...then it becomes a gas, then a mist, then moisture, then water.....ask yourself...how many H2O molecules in a visible water drop...the answer is
there are 1.67 sextillion water molecules in a water drop...fact

Another thing to consider that's different about now vs then is deforestation caused by human activity.  So far we've cut down about 80% of the world's natural forests according to the World Resources Institute, & just in the last 50 years or so almost 20% of the Amazon has been lost.

If Earth warmed as much as it did in the Eocene, not only might there not be nearly enough time for life to adapt (keep in mind, it is happening orders of magnitude more rapidly today than it did back then), but we may not allow new forests to grow like they would without us.  In that scenario, we'd be looking at mass desertification, which is indeed is already being observed.

there is not such thing as water vapor
it is called humidity...thats where water evaporates into smaller clusters of H2O not big enough to form a water droplet

the H2O when it rises, gets to a point where it cools in the upper atmosphere and combines with other H2O molecules once again and becomes rain....rain when it falls cools....soooooo, there is the cooling effect

also ...when there is not enough water to evaporate, the humidity just lingers in the air...not enough molecules to combine

If you're falling & you come to a gradual stop in the span of a minute, you will be fine.  If you come to a stop in a fraction of a second, you will die.

The warming due to human activity that we are currently observing is happening much more rapidly than we have evidence of ever occurring in Earth's past.

However if you ask him/her what the probability of it is, answers will vary, but will be on the positive (yes we have) side.
Not being a scientist but having spent the last 7 years reading science and listening to tens of climate related scientists, I'd say that yes, it is very likely we have past that point and that Earth is set up to evolve into a hothouse (no ice at the poles state) simply because of the many self-reinforcing feedback loops: less ice and snow, more trees dying and emitting CO2, permafrost thaw, more atmospheric water vapor induce by warming (the fastest and most important feedback in the climate system) and at least 40 or 50 more positive (increasing the warming) feedback loops.

There is a lot of evidence that CO2 always increases AFTER warming occurs. 

Then he notes that the climate cooled at the same time that atmospheric CO2 was very high during this hot period. Obviously there are other forces at work that are much more potent than the contribution of CO2 to the greenhouse effect. Couldn't those other forces, which caused the cooling at the end of the period in spite of high CO2, also have caused the warming at the beginning of the period? Not if you are a Warmist."

"Tundra_Hunter","2019-07-30T08:54:18Z","I'm a climate change researcher, bioengineer and PhD. 
I think the media lack objectivity when presenting global warming. 
When I talk to people around me and tell them that the Earth is getting greener, they are surprised. They didn't know. They think that Earth is heading toward a giant desert. But past warming showed us that in warm condition, there is more forests. (see carnian pluvial event for example, or this video). 
Here is what's happening: yes, the Earth is warming, no question about that, and it is due to rising atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouses gases from anthropogenic emissions. At the same time, forests and oceans are absorbing about 40% of human CO2 emission, leading to more acidic ocean... and bigger forest, more tree biomass. 
Other facts: this warming is leading to massive extinction, rising of sea level, melting of polar perma-frost. Other fact: warmer air can hold more moisture, and evaporation increases (from ocean and land). Precipitations should increase too (but how much on the ocean, and how much on land? that's an important question). Current models really struggle to forecast future precipitation (distribution, magnitude, etc). Some models predict future land to be (mostly) super green, some predict future land to be (mostly) deserts. Obviously, that's a big deal for life on Earth and economy as well. We, the scientific community, are still working on this. I personally think, but that's just my opinion, that we are heading toward more rain and more vegetation globally (with some local region being drier and other wetter). Some countries will be blessed from this. And some countries will be doomed. That's a worry because there is no accountability for countries suffering from climate change, and the ones who profit from it, profit for free. 
I think human society could learn to live in a warmer, wetter, greener planet, where there might be more energy (water, wind, wood), and given time and space nature will recover (with enough time, new species will evolve in that new climate). I think more than ever society will need to be globalised, as the impact of climate change will be global and unfair, and countries will need to help others. I hope there won't be a climate world war. I hope we will use our intelligence to live in that world, and that it will motivate the slow down of deforestation, maybe start intelligent afforestation (but we have to be careful with that), and welcome more vegetation in towns."

"niklar55","2019-07-23T23:50:51Z","The reason for climate cooling that started circa 50 million years ago is simple, and extra terrestrial.
The Earth orbits the sun, and the sun, in turn orbits the centre of the galaxy, independently from the rotation of the galaxy. 
During this orbit, the solar system passes through the arms of the galaxy, and interstellar dust attenuates the solar energy reaching the earth.
The time of this passage may take many tens of millions of years, and during this time polar ice caps will form, and due to Milankovitch cycles, glacial periods will occur, when the icecaps advance towards the equator, and then retreat.
A full Milankovitch cycle lasts about 100,000 years, and an interglacial period lasts around 10,000 years.
This one has lasted that long, so it wont be long before the Earth returns to a glacial age. The change can take as little as 20 years. Permanent snow lines will start to advance, little by little, but the process is exponential. 
Soon, the major food growing areas like the prairies, and steppes will be too cold for crops to mature, and Billions will starve to death."

"Hong Ee Ng","2019-07-21T09:47:03Z","It is pretty simple, the maxisma is caused by volcanic activities that released huge amounts of lava, however since at that time most of it was sea it creates huge amounts of carbon dioxide when it is cooling the volcanoes also spew lavas but the lavas did not cool down as it is on land but the huge amounts of ashes cool down the earth temperature! This theory is saying that the earth cores goes in cycles every few million years due to tetonic movement and the core changes it will releases huge amounts of co2 like wat is happening now, but then when the globsl cooling happens the core is much colder and doesn‚Äôt produce a lot lava but ashes instead! Simple theory nothing to do with humans, it‚Äôs just a cycle of life"

"Paul Heffernan","2019-07-12T14:48:13Z","So the most extreme pre-human increase in temperature in the last 66 million years was 5oC in around 3000 to 4000 years at an average of 1oC / 600y.  In our last 100 years we increased the temperature by 0.7 oC which is approximately 1oC / 143y.  So humans activity has affected temperature at around 600/143 ~ 4x the rate and we are still accelerating our use of carbon, hence our rate of temperature change.  It is just math and physics.  If you still do not believe then you are suffering cognitive dissonance."

"Petere Poet","2019-07-12T06:35:59Z","Let‚Äôs see, since I was a boy living on the coastline in Rhode Island since 1962 and crossing the same bridge just 100 yards from the ocean as the bridge allows tide water to flow into and out of a large salt pond. Even today when I cross the bridge during normal high tide, the tide water is no higher today than in 1962. 

Where are you measuring? 
And is it not a law of physical nature on earth that water seeks its own level? 

Those places that have higher water levels are sand islands and are sinking. Classic example is how unscientific the article is. The ocean waters around the globe are not stable to one area, again water seeks it own level to be = along the same latitude in the same season. 

So if Delaware USA is rising on average then so to would be coastal areas of Portugal. Temperature does affect water on the surface because of molecular expansion and cold contraction. In order to make any claims of sea levels rising, one must take several other factor readings. Air temperature, sunny? If so, all day since sunrise? Time of day and at exact high tide. Measured using an area on no fault zone tectonic plates. Area that is supported by bedrock, not sand or muck or peat moss. 


NOAA has estimated ( Key word Estimated) that, if little or no action is taken to stop greenhouse gas emissions, oceans could rise anywhere from 2 feet to 7.1 feet by 2100. ( 7 feet or 2164.08 mm) 
It only has 80 years to get to their prediction, so that would be 27.051 mm per year rise, or 1 inch per year. 
The Global Warming Gang Math never works out. 

They claim In Delaware, seas have risen in Lewes by an average of about 3.35 millimeters per year ‚Äî which is twice the global average ‚Äî and state officials have previously estimated that 8 percent to 11 percent of the state‚Äôs land could be underwater by 2100.

The combination of rising seas and sinking land puts Delaware in a hotspot for sea level rise, where rates are increasing faster and higher than anywhere else on the Atlantic Coast."

They also won't grow on land that has been flooded and contaminated with salt from the ocean. What food is growing has lower nutrient levels because excess CO2 does that to crops. 

Extreme heat kills people, livestock and crops from heat stress. It also results in greater chances of catastrophic storms, prolonged droughts and when the rain does come, the dry cracked ground can no longer absorb the water, resulting in flash floods and landslides. It now gets hot enough to melt roads and buckle train tracks and airport tarmacs. This makes transport difficult if not impossible in many areas. 

Species of insects as well as every other form of life are going extinct at a far higher rate than at any time in recorded history. Some insects are flourishing, but they tend to be of the unhelpful varieties, like the bark beetle and spruce beetles that are busy wiping out whole forests in America. Disease also flourishes in heat and lack of clean water due to droughts in the poorer countries is already killing people.

Climate change results in extreme weather of all sorts, but as we lose more and more of the glaciers and ice sheets around the world, extreme cold events will become less and less common, while extreme heat events will increase until that is all that will be left."

Before 1990, Belgium for instance used to have about 1 heatwave a decade. Now they have at least 1 a year. Heat kills.
Scientists have tested foods and found too much CO2 and heat lowers nutrient levels in crops that do manage to survive. The plants do grow but their food is a lot less healthy for both humans and animals. CO2 caused warming also causes massive crop shortages all over the world from floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires. Look at the global grain shortages in 2018 - 2019 for instance.

You're expecting the sea level to rise linearly, but that's not how it works: As earth gets hotter, the _rate_ of melting ice (mainly from the poles and Greenland) is increasing, because when it's hotter, ice melts faster.

And yes, rising temperatures - from whatever cause - release CO2 in response. And if - as with the PETM (at least the leading theories) and human pollution today - the initial cause is, itself, CO2, then you have a feedback loop - which is explained in the video: during the PETM CO2 is thought to have driven temperature rise, which in turn released more CO2, resulting in runaway warming.

And is it not a law of physical nature on earth that water seeks its own level? 

Those places that have higher water levels are sand islands and are sinking. Classic example is how unscientific the article is. The ocean waters around the globe are not stable to one area, again water seeks it own level to be = along the same latitude in the same season. 

So if Delaware USA is rising on average then so to would be coastal areas of Portugal. Temperature does affect water on the surface because of molecular expansion and cold contraction. In order to make any claims of sea levels rising, one must take several other factor readings. Air temperature, sunny? If so, all day since sunrise? Time of day and at exact high tide. Measured using an area on no fault zone tectonic plates. Area that is supported by bedrock, not sand or muck or peat moss. 


NOAA has estimated ( Key word Estimated) that, if little or no action is taken to stop greenhouse gas emissions, oceans could rise anywhere from 2 feet to 7.1 feet by 2100. ( 7 feet or 2164.08 mm) 
It only has 80 years to get to their prediction, so that would be 27.051 mm per year rise, or 1 inch per year. 
The Global Warming Gang Math never works out. 

They claim In Delaware, seas have risen in Lewes by an average of about 3.35 millimeters per year ‚Äî which is twice the global average ‚Äî and state officials have previously estimated that 8 percent to 11 percent of the state‚Äôs land could be underwater by 2100.

The combination of rising seas and sinking land puts Delaware in a hotspot for sea level rise, where rates are increasing faster and higher than anywhere else on the Atlantic Coast."

Taking an average of 5oC : 3500 years is an increase of 1oC / 600 years where even if we only used the last 100 years and magically stopped accelerating current change in temperature we would be at 1oC / 143 years which is already 4x faster.

"Sandcrab -","2019-06-16T04:10:03Z","So, more Co2 and methane in the atmosphere and the earth, on AVERAGE, gets warmer. This causes more trees to grow at higher latitudes and they trap more Co2. Overall humidity worldwide will be up, bringing more moisture to the desert areas causing them to grow more plant life, and therefore trapping even more carbon.  Again, overall the AVERAGE ocean temperatures will rise allowing the growth of corals and other marine animals further north and south into the arctic zones, again trapping more carbon.  Now, did we point out that over the last 10k years the earth was in a cooling trend heading to another glacial maximum?  The current trend in rising Co2 levels and rising temperatures started about 7000 years ago with the advent of slash and burn agriculture, and increased again about 5000 years ago with the onset of domestication of animals, but rapidly increased in the early 1980s with the industrialization of China, effectively ending the Milankovitch cycle.  We're all not going to die with global warming, it's just going to be a warmer as we return to the average temperatures as recorded over the last 50 million years. Sea levels will also rise back towards the average sea level recorded over the last 50 million years.

"Ron_the_Skeptic","2019-07-06T18:54:20Z","@mayra lopez, if CO2 increases in the ocean, the ocean becomes slightly more acidic, but that only happens if oceans are cooling.  Warming oceans give up CO2, increasing atmospheric CO2 and making the ocean less acidic.  There are points worth noting.  First, the ph level of oceans is such that they are not considered acid, they are considered base.  Second, CO2 from the ocean, injected into the atmosphere is the result of warming, not the cause.  Third, land and air warm and cool much faster than oceans.  Fourth, increasing CO2 does not cause warming; this has been the case over the last 600 million years, and remains the case in recent history.  During the last 100 years atmospheric CO2 has increased roughly 35% but temperatures are cooler than they were during the 1930's. Fifth, plants require CO2 for life; and higher levels of CO2 support more plants with less water consumption; earth is greener today than 50 years ago because more CO2 is available to plants."

"Ultimate Classic","2019-05-31T00:21:35Z","There's also the Permian extinction event which killed off 96 percent of all life on Earth, majority of life was killed off in the oceans due to the vast release of methane hydrates creating a positive feedback loop. The widely accepted theory is that the Siberian traps, a major volcanic environment, raised the Earth's temperatures to very high levels, causing the oceans to warm, which depleted oxygen levels, killing life and releasing the hydrates which killed more life. The global temperatures reached 10 degrees or higher. 

What's disturbing is that global temperatures will reach at least 3-4 degrees by the end of the century if we don't do anything to curb CO2 emissions. 4 degrees might be all that's needed to release the methane hydrates. 50-100 years after this century ends the greenhouse effect will be runaway and the next extinction event will quickly annihilate us and most of life on Earth."

It's like this, CO2 is a better insulator, heat passes through nitrogen and oxygen easier than through CO2, on a hot day, you go to the beach, the sand is hot and burns your feet but the boardwalk is much cooler, wood absorbs less heat than sand, same with CO2 as compaired to O2, CO2 would make a better ""blanket"" if you were trying to keep warm"

Years ago, before humans, there were many more geese, and as a result, there was more goose poop around the lake.  Today, humans dump a truckload of goose poop by the lake.  But that exogenous poop does not cause more geese to be at the lake.  So yes, when it was warmer, there was more CO2 in the atmosphere, but the above example cannot inform the ""feedback"" of the magnitude or sensitivity of CO2 on warming."

This cycle has repeated time and time again throughout history. Carbon levels rise, heat level rises correspondingly creating an ideal environment, that being hot with high carbon levels and high levels of storms bringing water into the central continents to feed to rainforests. The over abundance of oxygen producing plants then begin to deplete the atmosphere of CO2 and the earth begins too cool. It reaches a point where plants are locked into the equatorial zones, the ice sheets push down, and lower water levels cause droughts that exacerbate the loss of plant life. Eventually, CO2 levels begin the rise, and the cycle begins again. Climate change isn't bad, it's the natural order of the world."

According to those data we would have a very warm climate with virtually no frost to fear at all. Now lets move on the same latitude to the west, to Greenland. In the midst of that Island there is a 1000 mtr thick glacier that is also frozen in deep summer. Same latitude. And way colder there. As if we are living today in an Ice-age!


What I want to tell is that the data used in these ""documentaries"" is highly invalid to draw all kinds of conclusions about temperature and climate from the past. Really much data from millions of years ago is simply based upon just a few very local remains! Not on world wide data as suggested in these videos.


What's more: 

Up until recently it was assumed that at the end of the Precambrian era there must have been a great extinction. As fossils, found from that era did not have been found in the Cambrian era that followed it. New fossil findings however, from a new location in Morocco, that overlaps the Precambrian  era into the Cambrian era, showed that these fossils kept being found not only in the Precambrian layers, but also in the Cambrian layers. There has been no great extinction!! Just an incomplete fossil record.

It turned out that the extinction hypothesis was only based upon fossil findings of just one fossil location, an old seabed located near New Zealand."

And icecaps continued to decrease, expeditiously at a set and measurable and determinable rate which ultimately would affect the El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a effect in our oceans, vast Gulfstream affecting water temperature, resulting and increase amounts of rain in certain parts of Indonesia and China. I believe? Along with this model in place might come more massive storms along the southern coast of the North American and Central American Mid-coastal regions. Could we not look at previous data matter gathered from the last great warming trend using that data projecting forward about how long this period of time will increase and affect major areas of Crop production? Along with human migration and overall uses of natural resources? If so, and were able to do this, In somewhat of a successful manner we should be able to plan accordingly to achieve an overall equitable outcome. I.e. ride out the storm. The only x-factor that I find when I run a mental theoretical model in my mind would have to be due to animal and human appropriation pair- bonds verse's non-pair bonds, though I believe it is only reasonable to infer that large numbers of our species should be able to endure the natural cycle. But again, I'm a nonscientific looking at the matter only in the most general terms. I am quite for certain that experts in all these fields have already established these parameters.

Rising sea temperatures reduces the solubility of CO2 in seawater, releasing even more into the atmosphere, etc. Don't assume scientists are 'hiding things from you' just because you haven't bothered to research it yourself."

Marine fossils are also found high in the Himalayas, the world‚Äôs tallest mountain range, reaching up to 29,029 feet (8,848 m) above sea level.3 For example, fossil ammonites (coiled marine cephalopods) are found in limestone beds in the Himalayas of Nepal. All geologists agree that ocean waters must have buried these marine fossils in these limestone beds. So how did these marine limestone beds get high up in the Himalayas?

We must remember that the rock layers in the Himalayas and other mountain ranges around the globe were deposited during the Flood, well before these mountains were formed. In fact, many of these mountain ranges were pushed up by earth movements to their present high elevations."
"Swirvin' Birds","2019-05-09T05:16:35Z","@TreeFood Well we have a small disconnect here. Lands west of spokane were added to the North American Continent starting 200 million years ago through plate tectonics.

The Cascade Range formed 37 million years ago (through plate tectonics and this adding of land west of Spokane) that cut off the rain that fed the lush forests on the east side of the range turning into a dry desert.
And it was more like present day South Carolina and not a tropical rainforest.

Again, do as I suggested and learn from geologists that study the state.

Because that is where the matching rock can be found. It's' 'exotic terrains"" that 'docked' here through the movement of the plates over the last 200 million years.

You ever see how Baja Californina is moving north on along the fault? Well it's gonna keep traveling North and find its way here in so many more millions of years.

*edit* I was going off poor memory as it was San Juan Island in the San Juans just west of the Chuckanuts that is from Mexico and It's more like about 1/2 the state came from there.

"Scott Koontz","2019-04-19T19:17:51Z","CO2 levels are rising, so oceans are performing a a lot of the additional sequestering of CO2. Under more stable conditions, warming water would release more CO2 than it takes in.

Climate for the past 1,000,000 years has been stable, partly because of the very very very stable levels of CO2. Now those levels are not stable. Equilibrium has been up to nature in the past, and it usually took 10,000s of years to have climate shifts of note. The additional CO2 is making temps rise in 100s of years instead of what would naturally take 10,000s or longer."
"Cece Whm","2019-04-24T20:11:03Z","@ben nichols Whose genes? Human genes? Sorry, but there have been five mass extinction through prehistory and primates, including humans, were present for none of them. Climate change is the problem we face here and now, not a giant asteroid that Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck are going to destroy. Oh and fyi a big hunk of space rock wouldn't cause a mass extinction from the destruction of its impact alone, but through causing-- well, whaddya know-- rapid climate change.

"Cece Whm","2019-04-19T00:36:48Z","1: The rate of climate change. The warming event covered in the video occured over thousands of years, which gives plants and animals time to evolve adaptations that allow them to survive or even outcompete others. When the climate changes too quickly, it gives little to no time for adaptation and results in mass die-offs aka extinction events.

2: Weather. As the global climate changes, we see a change in weather patterns, which can lead to severe episodes of fires/droughts/floods/hurricanes/ect. It also affects agriculture, as farmers depend on a predictable, stable weather pattern for growing their crops.

Humans are not self-contained animals, as we depend a lot on the world around us for food, medicine, and raw materials. The climate getting warm too quickly will destabilize the ecosystems we depend on, put our food sources at risk, lead to further destruction of homes and infrastructure from severe weather, and foster a breeding grounds for new diseases/the spread of current diseases that were typically limited to warmer climates (malaria, for example). These pressures will inevitably lead to war and conflict as we fight over food and resources, fight against the powers that govern us or be subdued by them, or scapegoat ""outsider"" groups for our struggles.

"The Stress Theory of Hans Selye","2019-03-05T04:58:22Z","His presentation is specious. What he overlooks is the effect of Pangaea, the ""supercontinent"" that stretched from the north pole to the south pole and disrupted the air currents and ocean currents that distribute heat around the planet. The disruption of these heat dissipating air and ocean currents was the underlying cause of this period of dramatic ""global warming"" in which the polar ice caps melted completely, and terrestrial temperatures and ocean temperatures became abnormally hot.¬†The resulting hot climate accelerated evolution and produced adaptations to the hot climate. 

As the various continents moved toward one another to form Pangaea, some of them initizlly experienced increasing cold. At that time animal life was dominated by amphibians and reptiles, and plant life was dominated by gymnosperms. As the climate grew colder, the reptiles developed gigantic ""sails"" that helped to capture sunlight to facilitate warming their bodies to optimize physiological function. As the climate grew still colder, a new ""stress mechanism"" appeared via modifications of the reptilian physiology: the mammalian stress mechanism. It involved a few small changes that greatly enhanced survival and function in the cold climate: 1. a change in red cell morphology that suppressed systolic turbulent flow resistance and enhanced exercise tolerance and 2. euthermic metabolism that prevented lipoprotein solidification below 100 degrees Fahrenheit. These changes in the underlying stress mechanism explain the visible anatomical and behavioral differences between mammals and reptiles. These ""Proto-Mammals"" (actually they were the same mammals of today) became the dominant predators during this period of cold climate. 

Later, as the various land masses merged into the supercontinent and disrupted air and ocean currents so as to cause dramatic increases in prevailing temperatures on land and in oceans, there was a mass extinction of both marine and terrestrial life forms that were unable to tolerate the hot climate. The hot climate did not suit the stress mechanism of mammals, which became small in size (the better to dissipate body heat)  and retreated to the remaining cool climates. Meanwhile, archosaurs evolved from reptiles via a new cardiorespiratory physiology that utilized a four-chambered heart and accessory air sacs in the abdomen, chest, and hollow bones. When these animals inhaled air, half of the fresh air went to their lungs, while the other half went to the accessory air sacs. When they exhaled air from their lungs (typically from their rear end) they simultaneously suffused their lungs with fully oxygenated air from the air sacs. This enhanced their exercise tolerance as well as their bouyancy, and they became the ""top predators"" of Pangaea. They thrived in the vast, shallow, warm inland seas of Pangaea in the form of mosasaurs, ichthiosaurs, plesiosaurs, monitor lizards, alligators, and crocodiles. Meanwhile angiosperms evolved from gymnosperms and became the dominant terrestrial plant stress mechanism.  

Dinosaurs evolved from archosaurs via alterations in the archosaur stress mechanism that enhanced their exercise tolerance, but they remained poikilothermic, so that their food intake was applied to growth and not wasted on maintaining body temperature. The prevailing terrestrial temperature remained above 100 degrees, above the melting point of lipoproteins, for some 500 million years, during which dinosaurs became the dominant terrestrial predators. However their stress mechanism could not tolerate water, which rapidly removes heat from the animal body. Dinosaurs utilized feathers to retain body heat at night, when cooling temperatures undermined their exercise tolerance and survival. 

The dinosarus became extinct after some five episodes of partial extinction as the supercontinent began to break up into the continents that we know today. The mosasaurs, ichthiosaurs, and plesiosaurs became extinct as the warm shallow salt water seas of Pangaea disappeared. The alligators, crocodiles and monitor lizards endured. At present they are mis-classified as reptiles, but they are far more energetic than reptiles. 

Mammals thrive and extend their ranges during periods of global cooling, while poikilothermic reptiles and archosaurs thrive and extend their ranges during periods of global warming. During the present  epoch of ""global warming"" mammals are in retreat, while reptiles and archosaurs are getting bigger and extending their territories. Duh."
"John Vane","2019-03-05T03:42:40Z","I continue to be confused as to why the peak temperatures in the 1930s have disappeared off the global temperature record, why the cooling of the early 1970s has gone astray and why the temperatures taken from static weather stations in undeveloped country areas that haven‚Äôt been moved in 100 or more years now have to be adjusted (increased) to correlate with temperatures taken in heavily built up areas.  The normal way to do things would be to take the unaffected data and use it as the standard but that of course wouldn‚Äôt show a warming trend of .06 degrees Celsius a decade.  By the way I would like someone to explain how that .06 degrees is measured within the realms of human and machine error, particularly in the 90 years or so prior to digital technology.  When I flew in the Air Force we provided weather information to Air Traffic Control along with our position reports which, because Hercules are one of the few aircraft that fly international and trans continental routes between 18000 feet and 30000 feet, tended to provide a considerable amount of the real time information for that altitude band.  Outside air temperature is measured directly from static probes on aircraft and in most aircraft all of the temperature gauges are repeaters fed off the one probe.  It was not unusual, however, to have both gauges on the aircraft to differ by a degree or more - that tends to instil a degree of scepticism in a person."

Climate
 warming/cooling whatever, is within the natural range which could be

 in earth's history.) CO2 is vital for organic growth and has absolutely
 no effect on temperatures. All scientists get this wrong. Temperatures 
vary, then CO2 follows, with a lag of a few hundred years. H2O vapor 
makes the earth a living place and the sun's actvity causes variation to
 the climate. CO2 is just an indicator: warmer periods subsequently 
yield a higher CO2 ppm count. Simple as that. The real threat to nature 
is mankind and its pollution."

The chlorophyll of cyanobacteria became the basis of nearly all photosynthesis on Earth forming the foundation of our ecosystems.

What I don't know is why the retinal of halobacteria never did the same that we know of.

If plants were made with Halobacterial organelles rather than cyanobacterial organelles plants would be absorbing more green light and reflecting such light that they would appear to range between crimson red and purple."

This is frequently ignored B/c it contradicts the global warming narrative.  They want you to believe that climate change is slow and gradual and happens in a linear fashion.

There is a big yellow orb in the sky that has much more to do with changes in earth's climatic conditions with its cycles. Look at solar minums and maximums and the change in solar winds and its effect on the magnetosphere. Then apply hard statistic and you will see that there is actually causation with reproducible statistical significance."

Interesting to learn that the planet everyone loves today is a planet that suffered massive extinctions of marine species during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM).  This tells us at least two things:  having suffered massive extinctions does not make a planet unlovable, and coral reefs will recover following such an event.

It would also be interesting to learn whether there were any large deserts (like the Sahara) during the PETM.  I suspect the answer is no, and that information was withheld, because it doesn't fit the narrative that warm periods are evil."

In Hindu mythology a +/- 26k cycle involving this wobble is described. Now considering the two equinoxes and two solstices. The current location of the poles determines where the temperate zones, the sub-tropic and the tropic zones exist as well as the two arctic (low sunlight) zones exist. Now suppose as indicated in the fossil/geological record a pole shift is occurring. This would account for temperature changes. 
Equally of interest is the activity of our sun and the earth‚Äôs protective magnetosphere both of  which seem to vary. Physicists I know can tell you that if a coronal mass-ejection were to make a bulls-eye on us....well...not a pretty picture. You have to wonder if Elon Musk‚Äôs desire to hop over to Mars would work as a new beginning or a launch pad to a more distant location like one of Jupiter‚Äôs moons.

There was likely no polar Jet-Stream back then, because it is the temperature difference between the equator and the poles that feeds the Jet-Stream and temperatures at the North pole apparently went up to 30¬∞C. It is likely why the was little or no desert and nothing but geographic features separated dry from wet weather. The 1¬∞C of warming we already has weakened the speed of the Jet-Stream wind and made the it wavier. It is why cold snaps descend South ward so much nowadays. For more about the Jet Stream, see one or all of Dr. Jennifer Francis's presentations (search YouTube), she explains the whole thing really well.

The ocean is the earth's most important ecosystem, if it collapses then the land ecosystems will also collapse. And it had thousands and thousands of years to at least TRY to adapt the last few times the earth has globally warmed. The key to the problem is the SPEED of the change we are causing. We are accelerating it way faster than any natural process outside of a literal impact event can do, and yeah, things maybe survived when given 100 000 years to change, but they physically can't do that if they only have 1000. The temperature is going up EXPONENTIALLY, not consistently. Next 20 years it will be +1 degree C. Then the next 20 years, it will be 2. then 4. then 8. then 16. That's how exponents work.

Will the Earth and life itself recover eventually? Yes. But are we dooming the future of ourselves and life as we currently know it by pretending that this is GOOD for everything alive TODAY? Yes."

e.g. if there is abundant co2 for plant life, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean more plant life will grow. If a rainforest is well established with century old canopies, than new trees aren‚Äôt really going to be growing (the forest will have huge stores of co2 but won‚Äôt actually be using a huge amount of co2 regularly). If you tore that rainforest down but than let it grow for the next 100 years it will likely consume a much greater level of co2.

The crops we grow, the grass on our lawns, paddocks for livestock actually take co2 out of the atmosphere.

Other than replacing the forests with a concrete jungle, I think it would be an interesting research topic."

"Macks Power","2018-12-16T14:40:19Z","A few things I was thinking while watching this: global warming is beneficial for countries in Northern latitudes, and severely damaging to equatorial zones.
If the world actually got together and decided to control greenhouse gas emissions and control the global average temperature, there would be great debate over exactly what the desired temperature would be, and possibly war between polar/equatorial zones to have it better suited to their habitats.
Another thing I thought is that if habitat changes over thousands of years there are multiple generations which can adapt to gradual changes, expanding their boundaires into previously inhospitable zones and abandoning newly formed ones.
With a rapid change like is occurring now, they simply don't have time to spread and go extinct more often than in the previous arming cycles."

It's really not hard to affect the climate when it's worldwide. And no to the helping the poor and adapting; I believe it's incredibly well established that the better off people of a country should help their poorer citizens but that's about where it should end. Certain countries shouldn't get involved and try to help significantly less fortunate countries because that just booms the population in the long run and then has the drawbacks that includes with food and water issues. And as for adapting, we essentially can't. Humans are at the point where, by and large, the vast majority cannot survive without clothing of some type and the reliance on our technology and resource use through them. Our bodies certainly wouldn't adapt to it and given how the world and governmental exchanges go it would be next to impossible to have the infrastructure of our species and housing adapt to the changes in any timely manner, not to mention affordability."

The rise in CO2 subsequent to the temperature increase is consistent with CO2 coming out of solution in sea water (since warmer water can hold less dissolved gas). Maybe you should take a look at more historically recent events such as the Medieval warm period, the Roman warm period and the Minoan warm period, when global temperatures increased more than they have done in the recent warming period (which is consistent with the Solar forcing model, i.e. that when the Sun gets hotter, the planets - not just Earth - get hotter, and when the Sun gets cooler, the planets get cooler.

But now the big buts: First of all, even when we would get more than 4 degrees Celsius more in the end of the decade than before, we would be still degrees LOWER than at the beginning of the PETM. 

Second of them: We have seen high rises of temperature over a short period of time all the time during the last million years. In fact, the ""ice ages"" had temperature spikes of several degrees up and down, without any human activity. So a SHORT temperature increase is nothing, our earth cannot survive, our lives as humans might become difficult, especially the agriculture, but in the long run, the earth will cool again. I mean, he showed the amount of CO¬≤ we emitted in 2014, and yes, it's more than in the whole PETM. But we will not emid it long enough, to get to the CO¬≤ level at the time of the PETM. 55 mya there CO¬≤ levels were at least 6 times as high as now.

Third of the buts and the biggest one: We are in an ice age warm time. With emphasis on ICE AGE. And the ice age will at least be an ice age for the next 40 mio years. Why? Because the ice age happens, because Antarktica is surrounded by the antarctic water stream, a cold water stream. Although the melting of the sea ice there is increasing, the land mass ice will not go away. And this ice is the major coolant of our planet. We CANNOT get the earth to such temperatures as in the PETM, not globally. And even if we could... after some hundredthousand years the system will again stabilize itself into the ice age, because WE ARE IN ONE."

That was all explained in the video. Why scientists can state the current raise of CO2 as the only factor in the current global warming is pretty simple: they can measure Suns cycles and Earth's axis, and neither of them is not the cause. Quite the opposite, the current trend in Suns activity should cool the Earth, not warm it. So far there has not been another credible explanation to the Earths current warming trend besides all the CO2 we've pumped into the atmosphere.

Just as a side-note, if we had not started industrialization and burning fossil fuels, the trending of CO2 levels in the atmosphere was going to such low amounts and combined with the cyclical cooling of the Sun, we could've easily seen another really rough ice age right about now, and possibly even had so low CO2 levels that plants would've stopped photosynthesis."

"Fiona Tanzer","2018-10-25T19:45:29Z","Regarding the extra acidification of the oceans in prehistoric times - maybe there were still organisms in the oceans which had developed mechanisms to conserve calcium in their shells such as a mantle and possibly proton pumps etc. perhaps this is when species like octopi and squid and cartilagenous fish developed. Due to acid conditions, there would be no fossil record of such creatures. But it doesn't mean to say that the oceans were lifeless at that time."

I've also heard the theories about how all the fresh water melting (glaciers) and drainage of same southward could possibly interrupt/slow/stop the flow of the gulf stream, thereby upending all global warming forecasts and sending earth into a rapid cooling period. makes sense, and could possibly explain one type of global cooling. guess the brits will be the 'coal mine birdie' heard from first if that happens. there are other potentially viable theories as well. its also important to the conversation to admit that the equation(s) governing earth's warming and cooling have many variables, and their interactions are still not fully understood. also, the means and accuracy of past data collection, as compared to today's methods leaves much to be desired. I don't see how one could accurately interface the two and use that as a basis for anything resembling accurate forecasting of future events, especially where  built in errors in data collection are concerned. again I see too many uncontrollable variables. having spent a lot of time as a system's engineer for major space operations companies (retired now), and if this were my system to try and maintain or predict, I would pay much more attention to the major players as I said in my opening line. i'm not trying to take side here, just looking at the situation w/ a mind to understanding all of the variables and how they could possibly interact."

"John Coffey","2018-09-20T02:19:04Z","We don't have millions or even thousands of years to change the climate.  In fact we will be out of fossil fuels within a couple of centuries.   Once we run out, CO2 will continue to decline just as it has for tens of millions of years.

Very few people actually deny that the earth is getting warmer and that man is the cause.  The real issue is the Climate Sensitivity to a doubling of CO2, and there is widespread disagreement over what that is.  The IPCC gives a range of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees celsius, with them giving an average number of 3 degrees.  The skeptics are on the low end of that scale, and some people are claiming it is actually higher with predictions going from 6 to 12 degrees.

It is important to note that the CO2 response is logarithmic.  You have to keep doubling it to get the same effect.

The polar ice caps need a 5 degree increase to start melting.  I have seen three different sources claim that it would take 5,000 years for the polar ice caps to melt, meaning that we have some time to deal with this problem.  According to one source, most of our fossil fuels will run out by the year 2100, and the last one, coal, runs out by 2150.  By the year 2100 we will only double the CO2 from the current level, reaching 800 parts per million.   If we run out of fossil fuels then we are not going to get much higher than 800 parts per million.

There are strong reasons to think that nuclear fusion will be practical in my lifetime, which is to say in the next 20 to 30 years.  We might see it in 10 years.  It could make the whole argument mute.

I have repeatedly looked at the data for both CO2 and temperature from 1880 to the present.   For some reason a lot of people refer to 1880 as a starting point, and I have had a hard time finding consistent data prior to that date.

In the last 138 years, the average global atmospheric temperature has gone up 1 degree celsius.  That is an average increase of less than a 1/100 of a degree per year.  The level of CO2 increase is around 43%.  The relationship is not linear, but logarithmic,  which means that if I were to multiply these figures I would get a Climate Sensitivity that is slightly too high.  Still, if I do just basic math, I come up with a Climate Sensitivity of 2.33 degrees celsius, which is well within the range of what some climate skeptics have been saying all along."

We should also recall that temperatures was higher 8000 years ago. Turtles lived in Northern Europe, as well as grapes. 
Considering the still massive emission of CO2 (even if a 1/5 of today's emissions per annum) during PTEM, in over 4000 years level of CO2 levels must have been much higher, even within a 100 years of PTEM, compared to what we measure today. Maybe CO2 is not the bad guy at all"

The exact age and duration of the event is uncertain but it is estimated to have occurred around 55.5 million years ago. ...  The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. Global temperatures increased by 5‚Äì8 ¬∞C. The carbon dioxide was likely released in two pulses, the first lasting less than 2,000 years. Such a repeated carbon release is in line with current global warming. A main difference is that during the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum, the planet was essentially ice-free. However, the amount of released carbon, according to a recent study, suggest a modest 0.2 gigatonnes per year (at peaks 0.58 gigatonnes); humans today add about 10 gigatonnes per year."

_""The temperature at the surface is 740 K (467 ¬∞C, 872 ¬∞F), and the pressure is 93 bar (9.3 MPa), roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth.""_

love how everyone forgets that the Martian atmosphere is also 95% carbon dioxide (only 1.5% different than Venus) but because it is so much thinner it is also way colder, -63C;
_""The atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, and it is 95 percent carbon dioxide. Here's a breakdown of its composition, according to a NASA fact sheet: Carbon dioxide: 95.32 percent. Nitrogen: 2.7 percent.""_

so two planets, who's atmospheres are have nearly the same ratio of carbon dioxide in them yet VASTLY different densities and we are supposed to still believe it has more to do with carbon dioxide gas than atmospheric density?

so unless we put out enough of *any* gas to increase the mass of our atmosphere by *92 times* I don't see the problem;
_""The atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is about 92 times that of the Earth, similar to the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) below the surface of the ocean. _*_The atmosphere has a mass of 4.8√ó1020 kg, about 93 times the mass of the Earth's total atmosphere.""_*"

Now as for the scientific method side of your post: no that didn't invent the resulting perpetrators of climate change, people did. The scientific method is merely a testing and studying system, and it is not a production system for multiple things. And, additionally, saying that it would miraculously cure problems without any form of collateral is laughable. People suck to the point that even if we had flawless ways of counteraction they'd find ways to ruin it and start conflict over it.

What is apparent is that natural variability can account for all the climate change so far.  We have to remember that over 97% of CO2 comes from natural sources and CO2 levels have been up to 11 times what they are now.  In addition,  evidence suggests that CO2 levels came after the warming cycles.   This indicates that other more significant factors are involved.

Apparently while the sun is traveling through space so is our planet in the rest of the planets trailing behind the vacuum of the Sun as the sun changes positions in space so does the fields and Sun radiation to the planet depending on where we are and what's going on in space affects our planet and the temperatures of our Earth and our life there may be cycles that we can detect. There may be many ways to prepare for such events one of the seemingly easiest ways is to have a abundant power source for any climate and to grow more food vertically and stay in the ranges of shelter and comfort that are life and us needs for making the nutrients and water needs for everybody, that way we can continue the life cycles and advancements we need as a species and Cosmic or spiritual Beings as a whole. We may need to make portable mini systems that last bar some type of different Distribution Center or some type of place when we can all get common water sources from deep within maybe even power generating equipment we don't know the types of things we will need we only know our needs and that is at least a start."

The real issue is most of the infrastructure and economy is built around fossil fuels. So a sudden change would be devastating. 

As for over population... Its not the big deal a lot of people make it out to be. We are more than capable of solving those problems if we actually work together.

Also, I think many diversification hypotheses revolve around the interactions of plants and other organisms, so that would be interesting to learn about. Plants also are diverse within a group, I have found research examining the chemical content and concentrations of the same species grown in different parts of the world and there are differences. So the environments they evolved in, or how they evolve with environment or grow to adapt is also super interesting.

That's why CO2 will never be a problem. 
But cloud cover IS a problem, and it is now known that cosmic rays affect clouds in a very big way. They are affected by changes in the sun's magnetic field and more. The picture is not complete, but no unbiased observer can still claim that CO2 is the driver of climate."

"old time farm boy","2018-06-17T12:20:59Z","Medieval warming and cooling periods.

Approximately 1,100 years ago during the 9th century the climate entered what is called the Medieval Warming period. During this warming period the global climate warmed enough that a large part of Greenland was actually green and was colonized by the Viking people who grew crops and tended herds of grazing animals (Hancock and Brian 613-617).  Agriculture in Europe thrived as the growing season grew longer and crops could be grown further north (Hancock and Brian 666).  Humanity's standard of living steadily improved for centuries as the food supply continued to increase with the warming climate.  Global warming continued until sometime in the 13th or 14th century when the Medieval Warming period transformed into the Medieval Cooling Period (also know as the dark ages).  When the climate started cooling, agriculture production started to fall and there was not enough food to feed the people or their herd animals.  The Vikings were forced to abandon their Greenland colony and turn to raiding to survive (Wallace 16-24).  In Europe, people starved and diseases were rampant.  A plague was responsible for the death of nearly 25% of the know population of the earth (Hancock and Brian 613-617).

Wallace, Birgitta. ‚ÄúViking Farewell.‚Äù Beaver December 2006/January 2007 Volume 86

There is a good reason why ""human Caused"" global cooling/warming/climate change alarmist always start their measurements in the 1880's.  That is when the world was in the depth of the Medieval cooling period.  That way they do not have to explain that modern temperatures are just now getting back to the height of the Medieval warming period.  Makes it much more dramatic that way."

"Elder Millennial","2018-06-06T17:20:05Z","One major contributor, in my estimation, to the overall drastic cooling of the earth for the past 19 Million years, was the collapse of the last continental shelf remnant of the Isthmus of Tasmania.
Until about 25 Million years ago, a narrow land bridge still connected Antarctica to Australia, but erosion finally caused it to dip beneath the Antarctic waters. The SHELF of the Isthmus, however, persisted for another 6 Million years, but grew narrower and narrower as the continents stretched them thin as they moved apart and erosion narrowed them further. Eventually there was an underwater blade of rock a hundred miles long and only a few meters thick, at its narrowest length, about a hundred feet down. All that time, that wall had been channeling a warm jet stream from the tropics into Antarctic waters, keeping the continent no colder then modern central Canada. Then, suddenly, perhaps in a day, the shelf wall collapsed, all the way down to the abyssal plain. The tsunami that resulted was the least of the problems it caused. The jet stream was cut off and redirected around the suddenly official PENINSULA of Tasmania, which, no doubt, had a devastating effect of suddenly greatly warming the up to then cool climate of southwestern Australia.
Antarctica‚Äôs temperature dropped like an anvil and would never again see the spring. Almost nothing could adapt. The whole continent reached modern temperatures within a year. Some areas were freeze dried so fast, that if they were in rare areas that glaciers have never ground down, they remain perfectly preserved to today, as a new kind of fossil."

Carbon dioxide can persist in the atmosphere for centuries, while methane does not. In fact, one of the most numerous greenhouse gasses is also one of the most short-lived: water. 

Because water and methane are short-lived a continuous rate of emissions does not give a rise in overall concentrations. They're being removed form the atmosphere almost as fast as they are being added (in water's case exactly as fast). 

On the other hand, carbon dioxide builds up very fast because everything added this year is added to last years emissions, plus the year before, plus the year before etc.

Methane levels are being closely monitored, but the focus is on carbon dioxide for this reason."

ABSTRACT:
The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, WARMING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM CAUSES A NET RELEASE OF CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE; THIS IN TURN AMPLIFIES WARMING. BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE (TERMED y), AND THUS OF ITS POSITIVE FEEDBACK STRENGTH, IS UNDER DEBATE, GIVING RISE TO LARGE UNCERTAINTIES IN GLOBAL WARMING PROJECTIONS (emphasis added).

Here we quantify the median y as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for y on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of greater than 200,000 members, quantification of y is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of y calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that y is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. OUR RESULTS ARE INCOMPATIBLY LOWER (P GREATER THAN 0.05) THAN RECENT PRE-INDUSTRIAL EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF 40 P.P.M.V. CO2 PER DEGREE CELSIUS, AND CORRESPONDINGLY SUGGEST 80% LESS POTENTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ONGOING GLOBAL WARMING (emphasis added).

Open quote.
Around 15,000 years ago, the Earth started warming abruptly after ~ 100,000 years of an ""ice age""; this is known as a glacial termination. The large ice sheets, which covered significant parts of North America and Europe, began melting as a result. A climatic optimum known as the ""B√∂lling-Aller√∏d"" was reached shortly thereafter, around 14,700 before present. However, starting at about 12,800 BP, the Earth returned very quickly into near glacial conditions (i.e. cold, dry and windy), and stayed there for about 1,200 years: this is known as the Younger Dryas (YD), since it is the most recent interval where a plant characteristic of cold climates, Dryas Octopetala, was found in Scandinavia.

The most spectacular aspect of the YD is that it ended extremely abruptly (around 11,600 years ago), and although the date cannot be known exactly, it is estimated from the annually-banded Greenland ice-core that the ANNUAL-MEAN TEMPERATURE INCREASED BY AS MUCH AS 10¬∞C IN 10 YEARS (emphasis added).
Close quote.

I wonder how humans dumping CO2 caused such a rapid climate change 11,600 years ago. Maybe humans are so powerful they found a way to send our CO2 back through time into the past. That might explain the sudden current slowdown in warming the globe has been seen the past 15 plus years.

Perhaps you can explain how humans burning fossil fuels caused those two sudden warming events thousands of years ago."
"David Keenan","2018-06-26T10:48:47Z","What pause?"
"ProfessorEGadd","2018-07-11T10:29:43Z","Humans lose heat by sweating. When water evaporates energy is needed to separate the molecules. That energy comes from a human's heat, and the liberated water molecules fly away.

This heat-loss system doesn't work so well underwater, because the sweat can't evaporate. This is also why a humid day feels hotter. The air is already full of water molecules, so your sweat has a harder time evaporating. 

Because humans have such a hard time losing heat in water, even moderately warm water can be dangerous. Anything above body temperature will heat you up faster than you can cool down, and you could suffer from overheating.

Human body temperature is higher than any marine species except penguins and marine mammals. So a hot sea would be 'unbearable' for marine species because they are not good at losing heat. 36 C puts them only a few degrees cooler than the maximum temperature for their enzymes to function, so even a little muscle movement could generate enough heat to push them over the edge.

And remember 36 C is the _average_ temperature, including at night and in winter, so the maximum temperature is probably quite a bit higher. Current average temperature for surface water is 17 C."

One of those is solar activity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg

I like this video because it dares to acknowledge the politicization of climatology.

So, do we get rid of excess population? or continue to blame the very things we demand to make our lives comfortable?   Now the ""we don't know..."" when speaking of climate changes in the far past. Just perhaps, so called ""greenhouse gases"" were not the significant cause. Fact: greenhouses are warm because of radiant energy from sunlight. This causes photosynthesis in plants, removing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Humidity increases due to evaporation in the sealed environment. This helps trap the heat, the so called Venus effect. You notice this on a clear winter night which is cooler than a cloudy night. ""We don't know."" ""this may be the cause..."" Only proves this is still a theory..., not proven fact. The earth has been a ""snowball"" at least 4 times. The last ice age was only 10,000 years ago. What caused it to retreat? What caused it to advance? I believe those questions are still ""we don't know"""

The earth does not care where the changes comes from. The earth really does not have any mind to care. It is a rock. The majority of species that ever existed have died out. Thank god, because this would be a really ugly place if they had not died out. The dino ruled the earth much, much longer than humans have been on the earth.

Or maybe the sun emitted a frequency that resonated with earth's magnetic field charging the quartz crystals in our mantle (as harmonic oscillators kinda like capacitors) which than released the energy up into our atmosphere in the form of lightning heating the air and water around it thus releasing co2 from the deep sea, like a soda in a microwave. Or maybe one of the people who discovered this great warming was infected with a virus that causes insanity than met up with others studying the topic thus spreading the virus thus causing a form of group hysteria. Or maybe the co2 bubbling up from the deep sea is allowing an anaerobic infection to flourish and infect humans causing over all stupidity and the inability to think for oneself."

Unfortunately for humans, global warming is happening faster on land than sea. But global warming is measured using a combination of land and sea surface temperatures, so when you hear that the global mean temperature has gone up 0.8¬∞C in the last 50 years, keep in mind that 2/3 of that number comes from oceans and that the amount of warming on land is, on average, significantly higher.

My uncle started laughing again, saying it was just a bush. He stopped laughing when the ""bush"" sprang out of the grass and ate him.
   If you mistake a bush for a lion you might get laughed at, but if you mistake a lion for a bush you get ate.
   Is climate change a bush (a natural process humans can not influence) or is it a lion (human caused and something humans CAN influence)?
   To me, I don't think it really matters if climate change is real and human caused. There are other, very good, very real reasons for us to break our dependence on oil.
   If we are wrong and climate change is natural and humans will be unable to do anything about it, we will have still found a cleaner better way to produce energy.

https://i.redd.it/wrvdbbpa5uaz.jpg

Look at the map and you will see three enormously important differences between that map and today's map.

1. Antarctica was still attached to South America, preventing the existence of today's circum-Antarctic current loop.
2. There was open ocean (Tethys) all the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific past Europe & Asia, permitting water and heat flow between them. India was not yet part of Asia.
3. There was open ocean between the Pacific and Atlantic between North & South America, continuing the equatorial current free flow literally around the Earth.

Another fundamental error was lumping all carbon in the atmosphere (methane & carbon dioxide) together and comparing release at the time to human caused release today of carbon dioxide. He mentioned methane before this, but then simply ignored the huge difference in the infrared spectra between methane and carbon dioxide.  Methane is a vastly more potent greenhouse gas than is carbon dioxide. This error is then used to produce the usual alarmist scenario.

The errors in ignoring ocean currents and ignoring the distinction between the forms of atmospheric carbon make the comparison between that era and this totally invalid."

Next, the organism does not 'prefer' the lighter isotope of carbon, indeed organisms cannot tell one isotope from another. The organism simply absorbs carbon atoms, regardless of the number of neutron in the nucleus, in the ratio that exists in the environment of the organism. And lastly the isotopes of carbon do not have different ""chemical signatures"" based on the number of neutrons in their nuclei. All isotopes of carbon have the same ""chemical signature"" ie chemical properties.

For the time being I just wanted to mention, that I had a lecture about that very topic (I'm a biology student) and that's why I brought it up."
"Barello Smith","2018-02-10T08:34:34Z","Bob Trenwith Actually the oxygen-level in our atmosphere is declining but not significantly and that wasn't my point. Even if that wouldn't be the case, the ratio between oxygen and CO2 in the atmosphere is the important factor. The more that ratio changes in favour of CO2 the harder it gets to absorb oxygen and to disperse CO2 via diffusion for both animals and plants. It is the same principle that can cause CO2/CO poisoning in wine cellars or near volcanic vents for example, because those molecules can bind with oxygen-acceptors as well and the more of them there are, the higher is the possibility of them doing so instead of oxygen molecules. Also the more CO2 there is in the air, the harder it gets for organisms to get rid of the CO2 they're producing (---> osmotic pressure) which can lead to all sorts of serious problems.
And to answer your other question: Yes, plants do absorb oxygen all the time since they need it to metabolize sugars the same as we do, although - and that's the important part - they release even more oxygen than they consume, since they're capable of splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, which they do in order to make photosynthesis (they need active electrons). However, if there are too many exclusively oxygen consuming heterotrophs (like us or other animals) and too few oxygen producing autotrophs (like plants), soon there will be a shortage of oxygen, relatively to the high amount of CO2 produced. Also - and that's the actual problem - we're artificially increasing the CO2 levels on a massive scale but *not* the oxygen levels."

With North America and South America not linking ogether.. North America not touching Europe.. Antarctica further north than south.. Australia further south merely off the coast of Antarctica, India a huge island that had not migrated to asia to form the Himalayas, a biome unto itself.  Of course in their positioning, there would have been more flora that would exude CO2... So, to compare the two periods in relation to CO2 as a result of continental drift climate, runaway volcanism during PETM (Layered volcanic rocks in Eastern Greenland that are up to 4 miles thick were formed during ancient volcanic eruptions that caused a global warming event called the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ), leading to oceanic acidification  and modern anthropogenic is incongruent."

Scientific facts matter.

1. Last glacial cold period: from 110,000 to 10,500 years ago
2. Present interglacial warm period: from 10,500 years ago to present (Holocene)
3. Maximum ice sheet expansion reached: 16,000 years ago (random warming after)
4. Peak coldest point during last glacial: about 22,000 years ago (190 ppm CO2)
5. Peak warmest point since last glacial ended: about 6500 years ago (280 to 300 ppm CO2)
6. Elapsed time from end of last glacial to last warm peak: 4000 years of steady warming, a warming rate of about 1.5¬∞C/millennium (or 15,500 years if measuring from the cold peak within the last glacial but many ups and downs occurred like the Younger-Dryas 12,000 years ago, so hard to assess rate from the cold peak)
7. Cool-off from last warm peak: very slight cooling for the last 6500 years (a small fraction of a degree)
8. Cold to warm peak temperature change: 4¬∞C to 7¬∞C globally, large warming near the poles and almost no warming in the tropics (and this is less than the 5-8¬∞C for the PETM, which occurred during an already warm time)
9. Cold to warm peak average sea level change: 125 m (410 ft.), it came in various melt water pulses with 60 m (200 ft.) of melt coming later during the Holocene
10. Cold to warm peak CO2 change: 110 ppm (from 190 to 300 ppm), but probably less
11. Next glacial period inception expected to start: 30-50,000 years from now if no human intervention in Earth‚Äôs climate
12. Next glacial period inception expected to start: 70,000 years from now when factoring in human intervention in the climate but it is more likely we will skip a cycle
13. Sudden unnatural rise in temperatures: 1.1¬∞C measured since 1850 (280 ppm CO2), most of the temperature rise has occurred since 1950 (300 ppm), Earth now warming between 10 to 20 times the rate of the last glacial warmup, and this is occurring at an already warm point in the current cycle (like PETM), current global temperature is a bit above the peak warmest point of 6500 years ago (409 ppm CO2 in 2018, on a track for over 900 ppm in 2100)
14. Expected warming by year 2100 if we continue on our current path: 3-5¬∞C warming over pre-industrial temperatures, risks to human civilization understood to dramatically increase beyond 2¬∞C
15. The cause of ice age transitions is well understood now, and is even simulated in climate models, it‚Äôs Milankovitch cycles multiplied tenfold by CO2+CH4 greenhouse gas feedbacks"

Example if you release all of earths carbon reserves into the atmosphere the carbon emissions after that would be closer to 0% because everything is in the atmosphere already.

So when you compare emissions during paleocene-eocene thermal max and today it really doesnt tell us anything. Just saying that during thermal max when you have 36 degrees C sea water chances are that most of the carbon reserves are in the atmosphere already hence less emissions because there is nothing left to emit.

Our planet is undoubtedly heating up which just makes me wonder just why you'd show these twisted statistics. you could have made a far better argument by comparing the amounts of carbon in the atmosphere between then and now, and then based on our current emissions make a prediction of when we reach a similar global temperature. not compare emissions to emissions because it's so based on where you look on the timeline which also is completely irrelevant to the end result which is amount of carbon in the atmosphere, it's just stupid to be that vague unless that's your intention."

ABSTRACT:
The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, WARMING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM CAUSES A NET RELEASE OF CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE; THIS IN TURN AMPLIFIES WARMING. BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE (TERMED y), AND THUS OF ITS POSITIVE FEEDBACK STRENGTH, IS UNDER DEBATE, GIVING RISE TO LARGE UNCERTAINTIES IN GLOBAL WARMING PROJECTIONS (emphasis added).

Here we quantify the median y as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for y on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of greater than 200,000 members, quantification of y is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of y calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that y is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. OUR RESULTS ARE INCOMPATIBLY LOWER (P GREATER THAN 0.05) THAN RECENT PRE-INDUSTRIAL EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF 40 P.P.M.V. CO2 PER DEGREE CELSIUS, AND CORRESPONDINGLY SUGGEST 80% LESS POTENTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ONGOING GLOBAL WARMING (emphasis added).

The most relevant trend is that it's warmed 0.7¬∞C in the last 40 years. It was really starting in the 1950s that CO2 emissions took off. And the global temperature started taking off in the late 1970s. And now we're seeing CO2 concentration typically increasing by 2.5 to 3 ppm each year, versus only by 1 ppm per year in the 1950s. As to how I came up with 1.0¬∞C and 0.7¬∞C of warming: You see, that chart at 9:12 in the video covers thru 2014. It does not show the even warmer temperatures of 2015, 2016, and 2017, and it does not convey that 2014 was the warmest year up to that point despite being an ENSO neutral year.

"Eric Michel","2018-01-07T02:01:56Z","So if the earth was much warmer 200K years ago, and CO2 levels were also ten times higher than they are today, what caused the massive cooling? I mean if CO2 causes a runaway greenhouse effect, shouldn't the planet have just kept getting hotter and hotter until...? 
As I understand it Co2 levels were up over 4000 PPM at that time, in recent times they were around 300 PPM and our use of carbon fuels for the past 100 years have brought the levels up to around 400 PPM. So our use of carbon fuels would have to go on as it is now for thousands of years just to get close to where it was back at this last great warming event, no? 
Also the Co2 levels lagged the temperature levels by some 800 years. Doesn't that indicate that the rise and fall of CO2 levels was caused by global temperatures and not the other way around?
From what I have learned: yes, CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and yes its levels do in fact contribute to global warming, but the data seems to suggest the amount of warming caused by CO2 is very small. Doesn't the very fact that we have had these massive temperature swings in the past and the CO2 levels always lagged the temperature tell us this is true? So if CO2 levels aren't the main driver of global temperatures, then what is the main cause of the earth's temperature variability?
I have read elsewhere that many scientists believe it has more to do with solar activity. In fact they have graphs of solar activity that seem to track very well with global temperatures. In fact over the past 100 years where we have seen the ongoing 10,000 year warming trend (that we are presently in) there has in fact been increased solar activity. In fact the period from 1998 to 2014 where no additional warming occured, solar activity was also low, only in the past 2-3 years has there been some higher activity. In fact astronomers also report seeing signs of warming (over the past 2-3 years) on other planets in our solar system. 
They also predict that we are about to see low solar activity again for the next 10-15 years. So if this is true and solar activity is the main driver (which makes sense to me) then we should be able to see these effects very soon.
Also with all our technological developments it seems that viable solar and fusion power will be available in the near future, so we will most likely move away from our dependence on carbon fuels over the next 50-100 years (possibly much sooner but best to take a pessimistic view). 
If any of this is wrong, please tell me how and why, because all this gloom and doom about climate change seems like a big to do about nothing. The earth may warm or it may cool in the future, but that will have to do with solar activity which we have no control over. Oh and there are a LOT of very reputable scientists that are saying these things, only many in politics and the media refuse to hear there arguments, labeling then all as ""deniers!"" (which I find very ironic)."

I don't see much difference in what I said earlier and what you say now.  But you haven't explained what started the ice feedback, which cannot be the very small orbital forcing on the reflective ice sheets.  That's what's pertinent.  Ice feedback is a feedback, it's not a forcing, and therefore not relevant to causation.  Causation can either be orbital forcing (very small) or GHG changes (more likely)."
"cloudpoint","2018-02-10T18:29:55Z","My point 15 refers to *OUT* of glacial periods, therefore the referenced article is exactly relevant.  As I said, it is likely to be the same process in reverse but slower.  Use some intuitive thinking for the reverse direction.

An initial Milankovitch cooling occurs, this leads to atmospheric GHG drawdown by the now cooler oceans, leading to long term atmospheric cooling, leading to normal winter snow buildup not melting and eventually persistent glaciers forming over many land areas and a full scale glacial, until the cycle again reverses.  However, snow buildup plays out over much longer timeframe than snow melting.  This might mean that the positive 40% figure could actually be negative 50% instead, due to the longer lag.  That is, GHGs get to play out for a longer period before the ice feedbacks kick in."
"cloudpoint","2018-02-10T07:10:20Z","‚ÄúModels suggest that rising greenhouse gases, including CO2, explain about 40% of the warming as the ice ages ended. The figure is uncertain because it depends on how the extent of ice coverage changed over time, and there is no way to pin this down precisely.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the melting of ice lags behind the beginning of interglacial periods by far more than the rises in CO2.‚Äù

Quoted text from the link below.

It is likely to be the same process in reverse but slower.  In either case, CO2+CH4 greenhouse gas build-ups or drawdowns are what causes the ice feedbacks since the greenhouse gas changes come long before the ice changes.  Greenhouse gases are doing the heavy lifting.

"cloudpoint","2018-01-18T07:40:13Z","Jared, I appreciate your links.  Your links directed me to a 2013 study where the authors (Wright & Schaller, unknown to me) speculated that the Earth acquired all of the carbon behind the PETM in an incredibly short period of time (near instantaneous) based on 13 two-centimeter thick clay bands extracted from a Paleocene/Eocene ocean sediment core.  The authors interpreted these bands as representing years.

The 2013 study was refuted the following year by the study I show below (by authors that I have heard of before).  Wright & Schaller later argue back, mostly saying that *if* the rapid carbon excursion happened, then their conclusion must be correct, but they don‚Äôt really demonstrate that it happened.  Some other studies don‚Äôt support their methodology either (delta cores are too mixed to make sense of), so Wright & Schaller are arguing with multiple other studies in their reply.  Replies are not peer-reviewed.  Well, that‚Äôs the way science works.  We should wait for the dust to settle before running with any new science, especially if it is unrealistic.

Refuting study:

Zeebe RE, Dickens GR, Ridgwell A, Sluijs A, Thomas E (2014) *Onset of carbon isotope excursion at the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum took millennia, not 13 y.* Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111:E1062.

This is some of what Zeebe et al 2014 said, from the link below:

‚ÄúWright and Schaller use records from apparently rhythmically layered shelf sediments to argue that the layering is annual and that the onset of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE, fingerprint for carbon release) in the surface ocean was complete in 13 y. Using basic carbon cycle and climate considerations, we show this is not feasible. In fact, Wright and Schaller‚Äôs isotope records indicate that the CIE onset took at least several millennia.‚Äù And later ‚Äúthe climate system‚Äôs inertia (mostly ocean heat capacity) delays surface warming by up to centuries‚Äù.
‚Ä¶
‚ÄúAssuming layers are not a drilling artifact, we note that rhythmically layered shelf sediments, in which the layering neither represents primary sediment deposition nor annual deposition, form off modern river deltas, the paleoenvironment of the ancient New Jersey Shelf. We see nothing in Wright and Schaller‚Äôs measurements to conclude that the PETM onset was completed in 13 y, nor that a cometary impact could have materially contributed to the recorded global CIE.‚Äù

"cloudpoint","2018-01-17T08:22:38Z","The reason, though uncertain, is probably not that exciting.

Once the climate forcing stopped (e.g. when carbon-rich greenhouse gases ‚Äì carbon dioxide or methane ‚Äì stopped being injected into the atmosphere), then excess planetary heat buildup was both radiated away to space and absorbed into the colder overturning oceans to be radiated away later over a much long timeframe.

Meanwhile very slow rock weathering along with somewhat quicker ocean plant growth and land tree growth removed the previously released gases from the atmosphere.  The overturning oceans directly absorbed some of the gases too. 

Likely the cool-down phase took much longer to play out than the warm-up phase did since the above processes all operate over very long geologic periods.  The ice age phases play out in a similar way but with different initial causes and smaller magnitudes of change."

The most we can do, and probably are doing is extend the warm period by a thousand years at best.  What the global warming alarmists do is ignore the facts. High co2 levels are the result of the warm period, not the cause of it, and that high co2 levels never stopped the cold period from happening. perhaps the addition of the co2 that humans have contributed will buy us time to properly prepare ourselves for the gradual reduction of available food.

They are cause by fluctuations in the elliptical orbit of the earth around the sun.  We are more than half way through the current warming period, which  accounts for our current state of polar cap size. This will continue for a few more thousand years and then begin to cool again. This 85,000 years you speak of will be the far end of the next cold period, not it's peak. As for your math, it's based on the wrong numbers. Try again. Cooling will begin in the next 2,000 years and reach a continuous low temperature within 20,000 after that. The last ice age only reduced the human population by 30%. The next one would do even more. But it's not the numbers that matter. It is the struggle to decide who should get the food and who should be allowed to die off.. That is why some people are looking forward to a one world government. That way, we will have a true two class society, wherein the wealthy can be assured of their food supply, because the masses will be powerless.  Maybe that is why socialists are in favor of drastic measures like a one world government right now.  Food for thought.   Imagine a world so cold that on the fringes, people live underground, or in large domes. Imagine a world where farms are protected by walls and guns. Imagine a world where children grow up never knowing what it feels like to swim in flowing water, or to pick an apple from a tree without permission. 5 degrees F of warming could end that nightmare.

"Tim Hallas","2018-02-15T12:54:01Z","No Bob. my opinion is that the world changes and we may effect the rate of that change, but how are we to know that the change we introduce is necessarily a bad thing for our future. Have you considered the oncoming cold period leading into the next ice age. What if the effect we have on global temperatures actually slows the onset of that cold period and buys us time to prepare for a world half frozen. Have you considered how we will feed a population of 15-20 billion people?  Yes I think we don't know enough about long term climate change to make a decision that effectively could become a world wide struggle to survive. What global warming alarmists would do right now, without a single thought toward the immediate effect on the poorest people in the world, is commit us all to a world wide famine.

What's so funny about your discounting of the science disputing the findings of climate change science is that that exact phrasing is used by them to dispute what you claim to be irrefutable science. And then there's the political aims of the UN and their arm, IPCC. When science is 'weaponized' to foment economic change, it undercuts the findings. Again, dozens of papers and reports can verify that contention. 
Please re-read your representation of the IPCC. You correctly use the word 'estimate' since it cannot be verified; it's a guess. Also, it's really hard to change things more than 100%, wouldn't you agree? That sort of faith-based science hearkens to my christian up-bringing. 
You say you've exhaustively studied IPCC reports. Have you also read the reports put out by the NIPCC as thoroughly? Of course, you're going to contend funding-based conflicts of interest, which is what I'd suggest is the same for IPCC"
"cloudpoint","2018-01-16T19:58:36Z","I did not dispute your claim that man is contributing elements to the atmosphere.  And I did not say that you were completely wrong about the 1970s cooling, but as your own link shows, press reports ‚Äúdid not accurately reflect the full scope of the scientific climate literature‚Äù.  It says most of the literature at that time reported that global warming was the real treat, not global cooling (as does my link).

I do disagree with other things you said.  Being in disagreement is not a condescending tone.  I was educated through the 70s too.  I was very skeptical that the greenhouse effect was being enhanced by us in the beginning since I have worked in the fossil fuel industry most of my life.  But I invested 8000+ hours of my personal time reading the underlying science, as well as taking a few physics, chemistry and climatology courses so that I could properly understand what I was reading.  Luckily I already had a statistical background, which is an important part of climate science.  I was simply wrong in the beginning.  The science behind the global warming issue is solid and irrefutable at this point.  I cannot argue against it.

The kind of articles that absolutely demolish any notion of climate change don‚Äôt count since anyone can misrepresent science in whatever way they wish, and a great many web sites do misrepresent this area of science.  Only peer-reviewed articles accepted for publishing and then referenced by multiple follow-up confirming studies count in science.  The skeptical side has almost none of these.  Web sites that discuss this literature sensibly, as well as certain agency web sites that are considered authorities in specific areas (e.g. Hadley, NOAA, NASA and EPA) can generally be trusted.  The IPCC is the best reference for any climate matter since it looks at all the arguments on each side and weighs them as objectively as possible, but the IPCC literature gets outdated quickly since it only publishes every 6 or 7 years.  Thousands of new papers are published each year.  I‚Äôve read the IPCC WG1 reports extensively.

The IPCC has quantified the impact we've made on climate.  Its best estimate is that 100% of the warming since 1951 is caused by human endeavors (maybe a bit more or a bit less due to uncertainties, see below).  And most of the observed warming has occurred since 1951.  I can only tell you that the global temperature would be around 1.1¬∞C cooler than now without our impacting it, since that is how much the global temperature has increased since industrialization and natural events were mostly pushing temperatures in the other direction.  Other aspects of climate are too complicated to summarize in a comment fora.  I can‚Äôt tell you anything about weather because that‚Äôs a local dynamical issue.

IPCC 2013 AR5: ‚ÄúIt is *extremely likely* that human activities caused *more than* half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010.  The *best estimate* of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period.‚Äù"

"Siegfried Braun","2018-01-16T13:08:46Z","Cloudpoint, you can call my reasoning whatever you'd like. I'd suggest that you follow the same trajectory; just because mankind is contributing elements to the earth/atmosphere, it does not follow that we are the *cause* of changes. This contention is further bolstered by your '55 million years ago' contention. At the risk of seeming condescending, are you crazy? The most basic of research shows the climate has been constantly changing with some larger, some smaller swings. In fact, in the 70s, they were calling it 'global cooling' and we were fearing an ice age. How can you expect to be taken seriously when you brandish numbers like that?"

Open quote.
Around 15,000 years ago, the Earth started warming abruptly after ~ 100,000 years of an ""ice age""; this is known as a glacial termination. The large ice sheets, which covered significant parts of North America and Europe, began melting as a result. A climatic optimum known as the ""B√∂lling-Aller√∏d"" was reached shortly thereafter, around 14,700 before present. However, starting at about 12,800 BP, the Earth returned very quickly into near glacial conditions (i.e. cold, dry and windy), and stayed there for about 1,200 years: this is known as the Younger Dryas (YD), since it is the most recent interval where a plant characteristic of cold climates, Dryas Octopetala, was found in Scandinavia.

The most spectacular aspect of the YD is that it ended extremely abruptly (around 11,600 years ago), and although the date cannot be known exactly, it is estimated from the annually-banded Greenland ice-core that the ANNUAL-MEAN TEMPERATURE INCREASED BY AS MUCH AS 10¬∞C IN 10 YEARS (emphasis added).

55 million years ago, temperatures on Earth rose dramatically in one of the most dramatic examples of climate change on record. The world was never the same again 

Open quote.
In the late 1980s, as the world's governments were waking up to the problem of climate change, the mud at the bottom of the ocean near Antarctica revealed a surprise. Earth had lived through rapid global warming before.

About 55 million years ago global temperatures spiked. Then, as now, sea levels rose, the oceans became more acidic, and species disappeared forever.

Little wonder, then, that researchers view this ancient event ‚Äì known as the ""Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum"" or PETM ‚Äì as a potential goldmine of useful information for understanding modern climate change.

We now know that the PETM was one of the most rapid and dramatic instances of climate change in Earth's history. Its causes are still up for debate, but there seem to be eerie parallels with the causes of modern climate change. What is absolutely clear is that the PETM's effects were far-reaching. It may have altered the course of life on Earth.

The geologists who studied those Antarctic sediments in the 1980s published their findings in 1991. They reported that the shells of tiny planktonic fossils in the muds had betrayed the rapid temperature swings.

More precisely, it was the oxygen isotopes locked away in those shells. At around the 55-million-year mark, the amount of ""heavy"" oxygen-18 in the shells rose relative to ""lighter"" oxygen-16.

That greater abundance of oxygen-18 is a sure sign that conditions were getting warmer. Water evaporates more readily at higher temperatures, and it's the ""light"" oxygen-16 that is most easily vapourised. This means that warmer water contains more oxygen-18, and the plankton living in warmer water incorporate more of the stuff into their shells.

Those planktonic shells turned out to be useful for another reason. They hinted at exactly why ocean temperatures rose.

This is because of the carbon they contain.

Like oxygen, carbon exists in different isotopic forms. At exactly the same time that the plankton shells became rich in oxygen-18, they also began carrying much more carbon-12 relative to carbon-13. The oceans must suddenly have gained a big supply of carbon-12.

This is something that generally happens after a massive injection of carbon-rich greenhouse gases ‚Äì carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane ‚Äì into the atmosphere.

In other words, the PETM seems to have been caused by greenhouse gases just like modern-day climate change.

But today's global warming is not simply a rerun of the PETM. Earth was a very different place 55 million years ago.

One of the biggest concerns today is that the Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking because of climate change. This wasn't a problem during the PETM, because there probably was no Antarctic ice sheet. Even before the onset of the PETM, global temperatures were several degrees warmer than they are now.

Some researchers think the pace of climate change during the PETM distinguishes the event from today too. A controversial study published in 2013 made the case.

Researchers examined another set of muds that formed at the bottom of the ocean 55 million years ago, this time in the north-west Atlantic. They found banding in the muds that they argued was formed by annual cycles.

WHEN THEY TRACED THE OXYGEN AND CARBON ISOTOPE BLIPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PETM, THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE CONTAINED IN JUST 13 BANDS. THIS MEANS, THEY SAID, THAT THE PETM TEMPERATURE SURGE CAME IN JUST 13 YEARS (emphasis added).

This does not imply that the PETM came and went in little more than a decade. All researchers agree that the unusually warm conditions, with global TEMPERATURES AT LEAST 5 ¬∞C ABOVE AVERAGE (emphasis added), lasted about 170,000 years.

Solar Forcing of Climate.
Chapter 3.
Pages 247 - 265.
Key Findings.
The following points summarize the main findings of 
this chapter:

Evidence is accruing that changes in Earth‚Äôs surface temperature are largely driven by variations in solar activity. Examples of solar-controlled climate change epochs include the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age and Early Twentieth Century (1910‚Äì1940) Warm Period.

The Sun may have contributed as much as 66% of the observed twentieth century warming, and perhaps more.

Strong empirical correlations have been reported from all around the world between solar  variability and climate indices including temperature, precipitation, droughts, floods, streamflow, and monsoons.

IPCC models do not incorporate important solar factors such as fluctuations in magnetic intensity and overestimate the role of human-related CO2 forcing.

The IPCC fails to consider the importance of the demonstrated empirical relationship between solar activity, the ingress of galactic cosmic rays, and the formation of low clouds. 

The respective importance of the Sun and CO2 in forcing Earth climate remains unresolved; current climate models fail to account for a plethora of known Sun-climate connections."

We can see this in greater numbers of hurricanes, desertification of once arable farmland, etc."
"David Kahn","2018-10-22T00:15:20Z","It's not the solar output but the sunspots which correlate with increased solar magnetic field which in turn repels alpha particles from space. These alpha particles cause cloud formation which causes the earth to cool, so increased sunspots cause the earth to warm up. But there is a 40 year delay in the effect."
"David Kahn","2018-10-22T00:12:39Z","It is not the solar output, it's the sunspots which indicate increased magnetic activity, which causes less cloud formation therefore more warming, but there is a 40 year delay. This data matches almost perfectly with the temperature trend. Also the ground temperatures are unreliable, solar scientists look at satellite and ocean temp data."

Also, those articles either support specific analisys of a certain condition, mostly ignoring major variables to get to a conclusion or they just don't support anything like what is supported in this video. The most extreme temperatures in a believable article in that buch correlates sediments(including former organic life matter) to support just a few degrees of ocean temperature rise based on the residue, still that study doesn't seem to mention the differences in ocean currents and underwater topology itself. The climate has a gigantic heat exchange system, composed of 2 fluids, mostly oceans and the atmosphere itself, besides the solid parts from the earth crust and ice. How these fluids flows, depending on composition, temperature and crust topology, will form a complex thermodynamic system which receives Sun radiation (in many different forms depending of the behaviour of the star and orbits around it) and to make the problem even more complex we have to consider Earth's mantle and core as a different system that also influences the surface crust and atmosphere.

Can you even read and comprehend? I'm not making abstract claims but raising worries around questionable facts, just that! Also, if you dig just under the surface of some of the ""articles"" you only get that the world and ocean was warmer, but not even close to the claims in this video. For example the ocean surface in the artic region was at worse just 4 degrees warmer, not 20 degrees! And same goes for air temperature, the claims in the video are completely inflated and any proper scientific source that ""inspired"" certain web ""articles"" and this video was badly misinterpreted if they claim such high temperatures in the artic region! My best guess is they either just inflated the values for hype or couldn't interpret the data in any original scientific paper, maybe ""converting"" Celsius to Fahrenheit very weirdly, which still doesn't make sense, specially for variations in temperature."

I think Iceland became an island about 20 million years ago, as you say, but it‚Äôs complicated because the same land mass was part of a larger land-bridge from Greenland to Scotland before that.  As the continents broke apart, most of the land-bridge sank below the ocean except for Iceland, which was pushed up by the hot plume.

"VadulTharys","2018-10-24T22:23:01Z","Actually the warming from 1945-1990 was most likely due to the significant increase in CH4 production not CO2.  Hence the AGW panic when as predicted by actual climate scientists in 1991 there would be a pause and likely cooling by 2000.  And in 2000-2002 we did see the pause begin, exactly as predicted, something the AGW types have not once ever been able to do (accurately predict future climate).  The more recent warming we are seeing is most likely due to the HGWP gasses being produced in massive quantities by the new green industry of China who has no concern about environmental damage or climate change just on making money off the stupidity of westerns.  Do some research and learn what the real threats are today, it is not and never has been CO2.

I worry more and am more anxious about gasses that have GWPs of 24K than gasses that  have GWP of 1.  Especially when not one organization, not one government, not one alarmist is saying a damn thing about the 300% increase in their release since 2008."

Aside from carbonate rocks, the oceans contain the majority of carbon in the carbon cycle, and the bulk of this carbon is in the deep ocean.  If the deep ocean waters are warmed, or the rate at which they are overturned is increased, carbon dioxide is degassed from marine waters.  This is basic grade school level chemistry and is backed by every single detail of paleoclimatology known.  I.e., the glacial/interglacial cycle shows CO2 flux, all evidence shows that atmospheric CO2 rises or lowers following warming or cooling respectively, and the well known mechanism is what I said above.

"Pam D","2018-01-06T03:19:55Z","There seems to be a very broad picture where we are looking at effects of a global warming that took place over 1000's of years  and happened once; vs global warming of lesser amounts that has happened and then cause cooling effects to take place.  I think we should be looking less broadly and looking at whether the earth is capable of righting an upset balance - even if we caused it - if we stop causing it.  I know when the it was originally said that when the hole appeared in the ozone layer - caused by man artificially and not as a natural happening - that our earth could not fix what man did to it the way it could recover from natural causes.  It was said that once we made that hole with CFC's we had done something irreparable and had permanently damaged the layer that protects us from the sun.  Now we have reports that the ozone layer is healing itself, not quickly but its apparently doing something science said was impossible.  The earth has gone through many periods of warming and then gone through cooling periods even to the point where its had small ice ages its cooled so much  (1600-1880 EU for example).  Of course the times the earth has heated before was due to totally natural things - volcanoes and such - but the earth then appeared to compensate once the offending natural problems ceased to happen.  Isn't it quite likely that it does not matter what causes the increase in temperature (and that it could in part be a normal temperature cycle the earth is going through) that if we at least reduce the man made offenders (its pretty hard to stop the natural ones that just might be in play for a normal heating cycle of the planet) the planet will respond or just naturally enter a cool period as it has in the past.  I am not saying man does not have a hand in all this, nor that we don't have a responsibility to reverse the the things that we are doing that are adding to the warming. but the doom and gloom that we have done irreparable damage and the earth will never cool again may not be true."
"Todd Stanley","2018-01-05T13:42:45Z","How much of that carbon today is carbon monoxide vs carbon dioxide? This is one piece of data I have as yet to get an answer on. You can say carbon all day long yet it makes a major difference between which type. 
 Even though the question is legitimately a scientific question I have been called a denier. How is asking a legitimate question denying? It's not. It's just easier to call someone a name than to give a viable answer. 
I know this as from a mechanical background in both aviation & auto I know the combustion engine emits carbon monoxide. The burning of fuels leave one carbon. In addition the air we breath is O2. The combustion engine burns one of the 2 oxygen. This leaves CO not CO2. This is why California tests for CO instead of CO2 as well. 
  When humans & animals exhale they emit CO2. The plants take in the CO2 and emit O as they use  the C & one O for food. The O has to bond to something and therefore always bonds to what is closest. For plants emitting O the closest is another O. For this reason O2 is created. Which humans and animals take it & exhale CO2. 
So, again I ask. How much of the carbon in the air due to carbon monoxide vs carbon dioxide?"

"Bob Roberts","2017-12-31T08:57:31Z","It is true that climate changes and we don't seem to always understand why.  However, the MYTH that CO2 is a primary driver of climate change has been thoroughly debunked.  As this video actually admits, a warming planet drives the increased CO2 we see in the atmosphere and the oceans.  Not the other way around.

And claims about the rate of change being unusual are suspect - since the further back you go, the less certain we are that the assumptions we make about temperature and CO2 (and other gas) levels in the oceans and atmosphere are correct.  Let me clarify that -  we can make some broad statements about the average level over long periods of time, but we cannot discern the day to day, weekly, monthly, or annual changes.  We cannot say for sure whether there was a 10, 100 or 1,000 year period that CO2, for instance, either spiked or cratered.

One last thing.  Some would have you believe until humans came along and, in their greed, screwed everything up, the Earth's systems were in some magic state of balance.  This is not and never was true, nor will it ever be true.  There was never a time when the Earth magically absorbed the same amount of carbon emitted by all sources every year.  This is one of the many obvious lies theories that are full of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Climate Change Alarmism try to sell.  And if you see what I did there, tell me so."

Just when looking at the rates of carbon emission 4:14 , using the conservative estimate of 1.1 billion tons of carbon a year in the PETM, and the PETM taking 4000 years to reach its peak, that would roughly put the number of tons ""needed"" to have a catastrophic climate event at ~ 4400 billion tons of carbon. Now if we apply that number to today's rate of carbon emission (9.8 billion tons per year at 2014) then that means to reach the same level of carbon emitted to cause the same amount of damage, it would take ~448 years to get there, and thats assuming we dont slow down with carbon emission. That is A LOT of time for people to change their carbon footprint, so why is climate change so crucial to fix immediately?? I know that it is, but these numbers dont add up. Honestly not trying to start an argument."

"Raven Alb J.","2017-12-25T10:24:41Z","Climate Change happened since the very beginning of the earth and will happen all the way to the end. 
Have you people heard of the Ice Ages besides this unbelievable ""Global Warming"" ? It was not ""Warming"" that took place, but the inclination of the axis changed and that changed the climate. It was not Global Warming, but Climate Change. If a meteorite big enough hits the earth at the right angle, and the impact will straighten the inclination of the axis,...... at let's say 5 degrees (instead of 24 degrees we have today), we will have an instant Ice Age. No more seasons, no more tropical storms, no more people living past parallel 50.
 Is that too difficult to understand?  
On the other hand if the inclination of the axis is changed to 45 degrees (doubling the inclination we have today 24 degrees), than we will have the ""Global Warming"" you are talking about again. All the glaciers on earth will melt and there will be tropical plants at parallel 45, because the tropic will be at parallel 45. . There will be two small winters with some snow annually at the equator. 

Yes it will be some Global Warming, because there will be no more glaciers and the high reflecting white color of the snow. Also much more vapor in the atmosphere, and more CO2, because there will be much more plants on earth, but it is Climate Change not Global Warming. Therefore it is the climate change, induced by the change of the inclination of the axis, which increases the CO2, not the other way around. 

If you want to see what changes the climate and how all this happens go to ""Climate Change Not Global Warming (Ice Ages Explained)""."

Just as a few examples, Our clothes are made from both indirectly and directly from carbon and they have a CO2 footprint. Our food is grown from fossil fuel fertilizers and is harvested and transported using refined fossil fuels.  Our transportation that we all rely on is carbon based (and will be for the foreseeable future no matter what you hope for). Those same machines that we use are made from raw materials that were harvested using fossil fuels, Our homes and buildings release carbon dioxide and have numerous petrochemical resources in them from your basic plastics to complex resins. Even the electronics we are all using to watch this crap are made from strip mining (that distroy huge tracks of land and that too adds CO2 to the atmosphere), that same mining operation uses machines that run on carbon and again is made from carbon.  Literally just about all of the worlds population relies on fossil fuels unless you are a true hunter gatherer this remains true for all of us. I have an idea Instead of telling people how terrible CO2 is how about talking about how amazing it is along with the side effects of using it. How about mentioning that the world's population has grown so large because of fossil fuels and we currently have no way to sustain the population without fossil fuels.  Why not promote education in science and technology fields to help with coming out with new technology and hat doesn't exist yet like fusion reactors, or solar voltaic cells that have a ultra high efficiency unlike the mediocre ones that are currently used today.   How about telling people to use birth control to help control the population growth as a means to help control an ever growing  consumption of our limited resources  How about making mention of realistic and practical ways to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, like reducing what we consume, using stuff until it is just worn out then once it is truly wore out recycle it, refusing to buy stuff that is designed to waste nonrenewable resources."

Because everything I've read or viewed on the subject some mentioned the effect of volcanic pollutants on the environment and some like this video, bearly touch on it. The dire predictions I've seen if the one in Yellowstone erupts, indicate that the environmental effects would be disastrous for the world.

Also, if people switched over to less of an animal-based diet we wouldn't need to grow so much livestock that produces great sums of methane.  Some feel upwards of 40% of CO2s are attributed to animal husbandry.  We're only doomed as a species if we don't all come together in unison to combat this problem sooner rather than later.

Logic would say that if you see a huge increase in organic carbon and a decrease in inorganic carbon then the inorganic carbon was converted to organic carbon by organic life. This suggests that the warming preceded the increase in carbon as it would provided a better environment to support organic life. There is only so much carbon on the planet so total carbon did not increase, just the ratio's changed. The death worshiping cult of global warming strikes again because if the global warming model is to make sense organic carbon that was not man made has to just magically appear. I think the Sun might have something to do with it. There is no reason that the sun cannot go through a rather energetic pocket of space and increase it's output by magnitudes.

If organic carbon was just released as you claim, then why did the ratio change? Remember, total carbon is static and if the organic carbon raised in the methods that he suggests then the organic carbon would still have been in a high ratio before the warming event which he even claims is not the case as the epoch before was a much higher ratio of inorganic carbon. Remember we are measuring sediments, not atmospheric carbon as that would be temporally impossible. The logical leaps in this presentation are staggering."

The narrator also glosses over the fact that over the last 3/4 of that era, temperatures were declining, as his chart shows, despite high CO2 levels. 

He also keeps saying CO2 causes the acidification of seawater. He is silent about the fact that water saturated with CO2 is still not acidic, but basic, in seawater because of calcium. Because there is so much limestone and carbonates in the oceans, the Ph never drops below 7 because of CO2."

"Jarrod","2017-12-13T21:10:28Z","How do you figure, The Milankovitch cycle is a measure of how much energy the earth absorbs from the sun based on the different deviations in it's rotation (and distance) around the sun.  Also, the sun gives off different amounts of energy at different times as well.  The Milankovitch cycle is pretty much your baseline for the climate... All the other variables involved can increase the amount of energy trapped in the atmosphere or how much is released back into space.  Carbon varieties in the atmosphere can trap some of the energy in, but if it's a cold part of the milankovitch cycle, then we aren't going to get very much warming, and if the opposite is true, carbon is down, but the milankovitch cycle is in a hot period, then it will still be warmer than normal.  Also, We are coming out of an ice age.  That is why there is still Ice at the poles.  Our planet at it's warmest (ignoring all the anthropogenic variables) is around 20C (planetary average).  Currently our average has risen slowly over the last 30 years from around 13 to around 14 degrees C.  There is also evidence that Slash and burn farming which began about 8000 years ago, and ranching, which began about 5000 years ago, actually contributed enough carbon in the atmosphere to _prevent_ another ice age from happening.  That is why the _mini ice age_ in the dark ages could have gotten much colder.  There is more to climate change than just a few variables.  You cannot look at 1 variable and say that's the murder weapon, you have to analyze many different variables, including how much energy is coming in and being released out (the milankovitch cycle), gas makeup in the atmosphere, moisture makeup in the atmosphere, cloud cover, and (probably almost as important as the milankovitch cycle) ocean temperature.  The ocean absorbs more co2 as it gets warmer, and expels co2 as it cools, which actually counteracts the effects of the temperature changes (mildly) in a negative feedback loop (to a point).

So you can't say that the amount of energy coming into the planet is the smallest variable in climate change, because it's the biggest.  Everything else pushes and pulls off of that 1 variable."

And while the continents were closing in on one and another yes the South American continent broke free from what is now Antarctica.  This all played into the Earth going into a cooling phase.  We seem to have a cooling/warming phase about every 10,000 years or so as proven by the Sahara desert/forest cycles.  We are just now in the beginning of a warming phase that is only about 3000 years into it's cycle, the last Ice Age was the end of the last cooling cycle.  Not sure exactly how much plate tectonics or Earth's wobble plays into it all but I'm pretty sure they both do."

If carbon was stored in dead micro plants then it is not in the water and not contributing to acidity, perhaps I'm missing something?

Edit Perhaps you would expect the oceans to increase in acidity due to CO2 when temperatures fell not increased, ie all that carbon coming out of the atmosphere and some returning to the oceans? Or perhaps it's ""acid"" rain and excess carbon overpowering the oceans?"

For instance, this episode clearly explained the exsitince of dinosaurs in the arctics, yet there are other pbs documentaries that discuss the mysteries of the Arctic dinosaurs as though they were unaware of the difference in Earth's climate at the time. I've been looking into the ""science"" behind denying climate change, and one thing that caught my attention was the postulation that CO¬≤ follows the warming, and not the other way around. Thanks for reading, and keep up the good work.

From the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University web site (2003).

Open quote.
Around 15,000 years ago, the Earth started warming abruptly after ~ 100,000 years of an ""ice age""; this is known as a glacial termination. The large ice sheets, which covered significant parts of North America and Europe, began melting as a result. A climatic optimum known as the ""B√∂lling-Aller√∏d"" was reached shortly thereafter, around 14,700 before present. However, starting at about 12,800 BP, the Earth returned very quickly into near glacial conditions (i.e. cold, dry and windy), and stayed there for about 1,200 years: this is known as the Younger Dryas (YD), since it is the most recent interval where a plant characteristic of cold climates, Dryas Octopetala, was found in Scandinavia.

The most spectacular aspect of the YD is that it ended extremely abruptly (around 11,600 years ago), and although the date cannot be known exactly, it is estimated from the annually-banded Greenland ice-core that the ANNUAL-MEAN TEMPERATURE INCREASED BY AS MUCH AS 10¬∞C IN 10 YEARS (emphasis added).
Close quote.

I wonder how humans dumping CO2 caused such a rapid climate change 11,600 years ago. Maybe humans are so powerful they found a way to send our CO2 back through time into the past. That might explain the sudden current slowdown in warming the globe has been seen the past 15 plus years.

Perhaps you can explain how humans burning fossil fuels caused those two sudden warming events thousands of years ago."

Maunder minimum refers to solar magnetic activity if that is what you meant by intensity. TSI and the energy from the sun doesn't vary much with time. You said that Maunder minimum was not the cause of the little ice age. What was?"
"Guy Warren","2017-12-11T09:17:31Z","Did you read it? 3% eccentricity or 6% between max and min distance. Given the energy reaching the earth varies with the square of the distance, of course it changes the energy reaching the SIGNIFICANTLY. Glaciers advancing don't cool the earth SIGNIFICANTLY due to albedo and cause more glacial advance.

You didn't answer my question. What did cause the cooling periods at Wolf, Sporer, Maunder, Dalton etc?"
"Guy Warren","2017-12-11T09:00:42Z","Milankovitch is SIGNIFICANT even without albedo. http://www.indiana.edu/~geol105/images/gaia_chapter_4/milankovitch.htm ¬†""These times of increased or decreased solar radiation directly influence the Earth's climate system, thus impacting the advance and retreat of Earth's glaciers."" 

On your 3% weaker sun, the variation in TSI is small compared to the variation in magnetic activity, which is 20% or more between maximum and minimum activity in much shorter periods of time. The CMIP5 models only consider TSI, which misses the other solar activities. 

Look at the Grand Solar Minima, and the associated temperatures, and tell me what factor other than the Solar magnetic activity caused these cooling periods? It certainly wasn't CO2, which according to most records was very consistent through a large swing in temperature."
"Guy Warren","2017-12-11T07:21:51Z","Bob, you are seeing these factors in isolation, when in fact our climate is a Complex Adaptive System (look that up on Wiki if you don't know what that is). I model complex systems for a living, and I can tell you that the current CMIP5 based models would not be stable (the video says it doesn't know why it cooled down again - if CO2 is the forcing factor that CMIP5 says it is, and given the CO2 stored in the oceans, it never would). We know from MODTRAN that the CMIP5 models are wrong. There is now enough temperature and CO2 history data to show that forcing factor is wrong). Various pro AGW scientists are now acknowledging this publicly, including the RSS team. To correct a few points, tectonics can be short term too, as it causes volcanic activity and this creates the aerosols you talked about. Milankovitch does not need ice cover to work, the albedo just amplifies the effect, and as the video says, changes in temperature and chemical composition of the atmosphere changes the fauna and flora reaction to the climates. To not mention the activity of the Sun, the source of all the heat on Earth because it is assumed to be constant is very poor. Ask as solar physicist if the sun is stable. Where do you think the Roman Warm period or the Medieval Warm period came from? And why did the Thames freeze solid and glaciers advance during the Little Ice Age?"
"Guy Warren","2017-12-10T21:34:14Z","Bob Trenwith yes I have. Many factor effect our climate, short be long term. Milankovitch cycles, aerosols of different kinds, tectonic movement, albedo, etc etc. Why does this video focus on CO2!"

ABSTRACT:
The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, WARMING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM CAUSES A NET RELEASE OF CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE; THIS IN TURN AMPLIFIES WARMING. BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE (TERMED y), AND THUS OF ITS POSITIVE FEEDBACK STRENGTH, IS UNDER DEBATE, GIVING RISE TO LARGE UNCERTAINTIES IN GLOBAL WARMING PROJECTIONS (emphasis added).

Here we quantify the median y as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for y on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of greater than 200,000 members, quantification of y is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of y calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that y is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. OUR RESULTS ARE INCOMPATIBLY LOWER (P GREATER THAN 0.05) THAN RECENT PRE-INDUSTRIAL EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF 40 P.P.M.V. CO2 PER DEGREE CELSIUS, AND CORRESPONDINGLY SUGGEST 80% LESS POTENTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ONGOING GLOBAL WARMING (emphasis added).

"S R.B","2017-12-13T02:03:20Z","That's quite possible. Its a tricky concept. Maybe you could help me out here. What do you have issues with exactly? (The IPCC report confirms this. See Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate. ) Also if a big rise in CO2 caused a big rise in temperature, we would have had the planet fried to a crisp long ago, when CO2 levels were in the thousands of ppm. Water vapor modifies the rise, and so do plants. Earth has a way of balancing and restoring equilibrium, developed long before we came along, which works well, even though we don't really understand all the checks and balances. See this graph. http://www.randombio.com/temperatures6.png I like this explanation which seems perfectly clear to me. ""The ‚Äúsaturation‚Äù argument does not mean that global warming doesn't occur. What saturation tells us is that exponentially higher levels of CO2 would be needed to produce a linear increase in absorption, and hence temperature. This is basic physics.

If tropical rain forest and thick vegetation extended as far as arctic region then a huge deposit of the carbon should mostly exist in an organic vegetation form not as a suspended green house gas.

Also it looks more like this unaccounted source of heat was the one that triggers the rising temperature and emission of carbon gas not the other way around.

If there is an actual heating cause by carbon/green house gas it would be hard to differentiate its actual impact compare to the initial source of heat.

As far as this video is concern they never actually quantified or give substantial data that warrant a conclusion that the green house gas/carbon is the actual significant cause of heating.

As for non-linear sea level rise that wasn't predicted to happen, at least yet - when things become non-linear then it's too late, at least for non-radical measures.  You're mistaking weather for climate, which is like saying ""I'm not going to lose at roulette.

Instead of continuing to build up the sea wall they created a string of artificial beaches with artifical rocky headlands, which not only is much better able to disipate wave energy from cyclones, but has become a tourist attraction : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand,_Townsville .

I'll agree soil erosion is another thing quite capable of algal blooms.  The problem with the areas in question however is, as you said ""These have naturally higher CO2 levels"".  And that's my point.  It's not the anemic CO2 levels.  You would probably do well to look into the history of such events.  Perhaps you should check the history in that region.  Almost everything humans now attribute to climate change is part of the natural cycles of the AMO/PDO and various other long term cycles (with durations that are almost the length of a human lifetime).  And this is especially true of places near the epicenter of El Nino/La Nina events.  And if you ever look at long term climate records (which I doubt you do) you'd be amazed at how often there is no trend at all...or that it goes in the wrong direction entirely.  It's sort of like sea level rise acceleration, which is claimed pretty much every day on the news but when you look at the individual tide gages all you see is uneventful, linear trends, some going on at essentially the same rate for 150 years or more.

It's just one sick, sad shell game for people that THINK they know something.  CHECK THE DATA!  Never take anyone's word for it.  Too much lying.  They'll tell you things like ""OMG, the sea level is clearly accelerating""...then you look at the actual data and it turns out that it's remarkably unremarkable.

Opposite when we get around to the other side of the sun, our winter and their summer. If the earth's axis of rotation were straight up and down, we would have no seasons, the length of day and night would be equal all year long. And at both poles the sun would never rise, it would constantly circle around the horizon - it would be sunset 24/7 all year long at the poles.

  2) The way CO2 traps solar radiation has nothing to do with 'magic' and everything to do with observed and measured chemistry that humans have been aware of for more than a century: https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/bender/CO2Sampling/climate.xml

  3) Your claims of a conspiracy also do not match reality as there is *orders of magnitude* more money available from those who *oppose* the idea of anthropogenic climate change than the science that observes and measures it. Namely the fossil fuel industries across the globe....and even *their own* scientists have warned about AGW for years: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/

 4) The part that you're confused about is that the *opposition* to the science is purely politically (and sometimes religiously) motivated....not the science itself. To demonstrate this, I challenge you to cite the opposition research to anthropogenic climate change using purely scientific sources and *not political/religious sources* . See which side has the most research/data.
  There's a reason for the worldwide scientific consensus on this issue and why every major scientific organization on the planet recognizes the problem. No, its not a conspiracy. Its an observed and measured scientific reality that contradicts your preferred political views.

 5) Just out of curiosity, exactly what political agenda do you think is served by warning about how we are changing the chemistry of the atmosphere? Also, why would the vast majority of scientists across the planet hold such a strong allegiance to that single agenda (whatever it is) as to coordinate and fake entire libraries of scientific research/data to falsely further that agenda? If its not simply what the science shows, why would the worldwide scientific community destroy science itself to misrepresent it? What is to gain from that?
  By contrast, its quite clear what is to gain by those who oppose it.

  Why is it the non-scientific people who oppose particular scientific ideas always resort to claims of a massive evil conspiracy to refute those ideas instead of science itself?"

""And it ended much at it began, suddenly and mysteriously.""

Also the video never explain or give any data that shows the actual contribution of carbon accumulation in the process of PETM heating.

A heating that ""suddenly"" begin and ended couldnt be attributed to green house accumulation considering as there are many environmental buffers and factors that affect carbon accumulations.

Considering the fact that vegetation runs rampant during that era (it extend as far as the arctic as said in the video) any significant carbon accumulation in the atmosphere would be buffered by massive photosynthetic absorption. 

Atmospheric Carbon spike during any warming is not a mystery. Oceans are the earths biggest carbon sink and during warm period the dissolve carbon gases will be liberated from the ocean. 

The problem with the CO2 induce warming theory as far as this video is concern ,however, is that they readily the blame the warming to the spike of CO2 without actually accounting to its actual heating effect compare to the unaccounted actual source of this ""sudden"" and ""mysterious"" heating."

The isotopes information only reveals that plant preferred the lighter carbon isotopes and the one which was in abundance during PETM was the lighter one, suggesting that the most probable source of the initial carbon outbreak was sudden, rapid, and massive burning of plant material.

It never said anything about how the carbon maintained its presence in the atmosphere or sustain such incredible rate of emission and accumulation enough to cause long term run-away global warming.

Plant life will readily absorbed atmospheric CO2 during the process of photosynthesis and PETM had over abundance of plant life.

So it would suggest that these forest fires must be very massive and had been sustained non-stopped for millenia in order to break the photosynthetic absorption rate and introduce an actual significant CO2 accumulation.

I never even mentioned modern climate politic in my initial statements.

My query is about their analysis to the real cause of warming during the PETM period which the presentor said had start and ended ""SUDDENLY AND MYSTERIOUSLY""

- How can the proposed atmospheric carbon accumulation cause a sudden heating and cooling of the earth?

- How much of the heating was attributed to the green house gas trapping heat compared to the initial cause of heating? (the one that cause the liberation of CO2 and green house gas into the atmosphere(

- How can a significant carbon accumulate in the atmosphere for 200,000 years when the earth is practically covered with plants?

The one argument that I can think of against claws is that one might think they would hurt the hand if you curl it into a fist, but that is simply not true. Effective fists, especially ones used for grasping tools do not curl the last joint into the palm, they sit on top of it, where the claws will be safely tucked back away from your own flesh.

The entire warm period lasted for about *200,000* years. Global temperatures increased by 5‚Äì8 ¬∞C. The carbon dioxide was likely released in two pulses, the first lasting less than 2,000 years. Such a repeated carbon release is in line with current global warming. A main difference is that during the PETM, the planet was essentially ice-free. However, the amount of released carbon, according to a recent study, suggest a modest 0.2 gigatonnes a year (at peaks 0.58 gigatonnes), humans today add about 10 gigatonnes a year.  (wikipedia)"

Simply paint it white or park a small probe near it as a 'gravity tractor', or other methods.  We are likely to send ""micro-probes"" to Alpha Centuri in the next couple/several decades.  (have you not heard of it?  Land based laser beams to 'solar sail' ultra lite probes to some V= 0.2 C?  It seems to be in the works...Breakthrough Star Shot, I think it's called)

The generally accepted frequency (very roughly) of a KT type impactor is about 100M yr.s, it could catch us by surprise tomorrow obviously but we have the capacity with a few million bucks per year to find virtually all of them decades before they would hit.

  Sending animals (people) to the next viable star system may take a couple hundred yr.s, but again that's next to nothing in the big picture, except that we can't know when the window for such capability may close (civilization collapse say).  So there is urgency.  

Although I think living on Mars would be worse than prison in many ways, it maybe possible to establish self sufficient colonies there in a few decades....that would be a significant insurance policy against human extinction.  And there are no shortage of applicants for the challenge.  They might all die the first time but maybe by the 2nd or 3rd go?"
"Alexandria","2017-12-05T07:32:21Z","@Bo We're still leagues off from being able to harness the energy and resources for any of that. Pop culture science tries to make it seem like it's right around the corner, but realistically when you get down to applying it all, it's rather difficult. And that's assuming we get the technology before we use our double-edged technology to off ourselves. We're realistically nowhere near visiting other stellar bodies with anything other than probes. Of which are likely over 100 years off at the very least, unless we somehow make an initiative to funnel massive amounts of resources into such projects."
"Bo McGillacutty","2017-12-05T05:03:43Z","Humanity just might redeem itself via distributing complex life over multiple cosmic bodies including other star systems which we are on the cusp of doing now.   Something that apparently no other life form on Earth has come close to achieving.  Also we MIGHT prevent one of the worst sort of extinction events likely...ie. the next K/T scale impact, in which case one would have to conclude that we have done far more good than bad by your metric.  (probably)"

"Bo McGillacutty","2017-12-05T04:56:10Z","The whale one is easy--they are remnants from when whales were land animals, some whales still have rear legs too, some still external and 'nearly useless', most internal and apparently completely useless.  The front ""legs and feet"" are obviously useful in the form of flippers and as you say, their bones strongly resemble (albeit highly distorted) front legs of most other land quadrupeds...and of course the arms (front legs really) of primates.  That's exactly the way one would expect evolution to work, same for why they breath air when the vast majority of full time aquatic creatures 'breath water'."

Well, here's the synopsis:

Continental drift was first proposed based on Permo-Triassic fossils, which show a distribution of species different to what we'd expect if the continents had their present locations--notable the Southern Hemisphere. Similar faunal and floral assemblages are found in South America, South Africa, India, and Southern China, but not in the rest of the northern Hemisphere. Here's a map that explains it:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Snider-Pellegrini_Wegener_fossil_map.svg

My background is more extensive than the weather channel, read below for a deeper dive.  It is truly amazing how water makes our world inhabitable.

Scientific fact that airs ability to hold water vapor is not linear.  So hotter temps hold way more water than cold temps.  The cold poles of the world are basically deserts, but cold.  When it comes to precipitation, the focus should be on precipitable water vapor.  In the summer, with heat and humidity waves, the air can contain upwards of 4% water vapor by volume, we call this a muggy day.  The watervapor is fuel for storage because when water vapor condenses then latent heat is released.  When Air rises and the temp declines to the dew point, then the condensing water vapor heats the air from the latent heat of condensation of water (water going from gas to liquid) thus causing the temperature drop in air when it rises to no longer cool at dry adiabatic lapse rate but instead at this wet one. The air rises so long as it is warmer than the surrounding air and/or there is momentum for it to rise.  See I had to explain and explain cause while there are generalities, there are so many variables, it can complicate things.
Heck storm chasers have seen setups that looked like mega storms just turn into huge area of just weak rain showers that day.
Here are the main influencer in climate:
#1 Sunlight and that light actually reaching the ground (not reflected by clouds or dust like from volcanoes or worse)
#2 Water Vapor - Primary greenhouse gas forcing warming of tens of degrees next warming
#3 Thickness of atmosphere making the surface temperature livable.  See at 35,000 feet the temp varies, but it is normally at or below freezing.  While on the ground it could be 70 degrees F.
If you look at Venus, the surface temperature is so high, not due to the sun, heck light doesn't even reach the surface, but instead due to the extreme pressure.  The air gets compressed from the dry adiabatic lapse rate and by the time it is at the surface it is scorchingly hot.

"Navarr Jenkins","2017-12-11T05:06:27Z","Smart sounding rhetoric such as used in this video does not change the facts about greenhouse gases and effects on ""global warming."" Whenever anyone tries to claim that CO2 levels are primarily responsible for either significant warming or cooling on a planet, they are ignoring every other part of climate, including those that have a much bigger impact on changes in temperature. 

They ignore and fail to mention such scientific facts because such would not fit into the agenda being pushed - which is an idiotic agenda considering that spending all of the world's current combined wealth on trying to reduce CO2 in Earth's atmosphere would have very little impact (as many studies have shown). 

Why? Because 1. Greenhouse gases are not the primary contributing factor to warming/cooling on a planet. The primary driver of climate on Earth is...drumroll...the SUN! Thankfully greenhouse gases (combined) do make a noticeable difference, or we wouldn't enjoy the comfortable planet we do. But 2. Water vapor is by far the most abundant and powerful greenhouse gas on Earth. Yet you never hear of the agenda people pushing regulations on water vapor... CO2 is 3. one of the weakest and least plentiful greenhouse gas by percentage of all greenhouse gas effect in our atmosphere. 

Did you know that greenhouse owners (where the term greenhouse gas comes from) do not pump excess CO2 into their growing houses for the warming effect? They use CO2 for plant growth and yield increase. The enclosure itself and physical yet transparent barrier (glass/plexiglass/plastic) is what traps in the heat and provides the warming. 

But there's no money nor power to be had by admitting such elementary science and reality to the general public. There is money and power to had in turning what plant life loves (higher CO2 levels) and causes more greening on the planet (increased atmospheric CO2) into a ""pollutant"" to be ""regulated"" and ""taxed."" 

Not only is CO2 a weak greenhouse gas (as far as percentage of all greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and power to effect temperature change), but the higher the concentration, the less the effect is per molecule of CO2 present. This is because the warming effect of CO2 (or any greenhouse gas) is logarithmic - as the concentration increases the rate of effect diminishes. 

If that isn't clear, here is an easy example. If increasing the CO2 concentration by 100 parts per million required a warming effect of 0.1 degree celcius, to get another 0.1 degree change after that would require 200 more parts per million concentration. That's right, to get the same warming effect as the previous you have to DOUBLE the next increase. 

Another way this can be said is the law of diminishing returns. You need to keep spending more CO2 (by double each time) to get the same effect as previously achieved. This then means there is a ceiling at which the change is no longer perceptible - it becomes infinitesimal. 

Plus, they will not remind you of ecology 101, that plants NEED a minimum concentration of CO2 to survive. To thrive they need an even higher concentration. Prior to the ""industrial age"" with human CO2 emissions, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 on Earth was getting dangerously low. Had it continued to drop, eventually the level at which plants can survive would have been dropped through, and all life on Earth would end (unless some natural cause had corrected this first). The CO2 concentration had been declining for a long time, due to vastly decreased volcanism (volcanic activity) on Earth - what helped life on this planet boom millions of years ago. 

Now, when we burn something like coal, we are recycling CO2 back into the atmosphere that used to be there back when forests covered the planet - those vast forests died off and were trapped in the Earth, forming coal deposits. In other words, it was the higher concentration of CO2 back then that allowed for life thriving more on the planet, but over time such became trapped in the Earth and the atmosphere became depleted over time, in comparison. 

Had the CO2 concentration fallen to 150 ppm or below - say goodbye to life on the planet as we know it - plants would die followed by all animal life dependent on plants - goodbye food chain. 

By contrast, life has thrived on this planet with atmospheric CO2 levels far higher than now (about 450 ppm - increased to such thanks to humans). We haven't even hit the optimal concentration of CO2 yet (plants love about 1500 ppm and will grow faster, bigger, and yield much more food). 

They have you too busy being scared of ""rapid warming"" to stop and think about how much the environment needs to get back to what is optimal for plants, and therefore the food chain dependent on them. Just as any greenhouse owner knows, CO2 is not what causes much noticeable warming in the grow house - CO2 is primarily there for the plants nourishment - the SUN is what primarily warms the greenhouse (or less SUN  means cooler greenhouse unless the owner uses a heater to artificially warm it). 

If you doubt any of this, then take a look at the terribly wrong predictions of all the fear mongers using CO2 as the big bad warming agent of doom. Their predictions (which are supposed to be ""scientific"") have all been way off for 2 decades now. We're still here. The oceans haven't risen significantly. The polar ice has not decreased significantly over time (only seasonally), and the global temperature averages have leveled out (and are likely headed to cooling over the next couple of decades due to the solar cycle we are entering). 

Meanwhile, satellite imagery shows the planet greening in the deserts (or at least on the edges, more each year, shrinking the deserts). Do you know why? Because leaves need more stomata (pores) to get enough CO2 for the plant when the atmospheric level is lower. More stomata means more water loss from the plant by evaporation. Thus they need more regular watering (rain) to survive, and then cannot survive in more arid climates. But if you increase the CO2 concentration, the plants need fewer stomata, lose less water to evaporation, and thus need less rain to survive and even thrive. 

At some point it is time to do your own research and put your thinking cap on rather than listen to media propaganda which is typically biased towards an agenda.

And if you are thinking, ""But scientists surely don't have an agenda like the media may, and they will tell us the truth!"" you haven't considered what it would be like these days trying to be a ""scientist"" making a living while bucking the powers that be who hold all of their grant money and other funds. Go be a scientist and see how quickly the funding dries up if you dare go against the money masters."

But then of course over millions and millions of years of 0 volcanic activity or very little volcanic activity all the carbon dioxide was reabsorbed by plant life. I suspect most of it was Pete Moss. That eventually was covered ancients Rock deposits. It got compressed and turned into coal. Taking the carbon out of the atmosphere cool the planet. But the last ten thousand years the climate has been stable. It says the start of the Industrial Revolution that humans have been burning coal oil and natural gas and reversing the climates turning Earth into Hothouse Earth. We're approaching a point of no return. Call The Tipping Point where it is irreversible"

"Juan Manuel","2018-01-21T14:46:02Z","corchem Positive feedback doesn't happen infinitely. A doubling of CO2 causes a 2-4.5C increase in global temperature. Solar forcing and the Milankovich cycles also cause most if not all of the initial forcing, with CO2 taking over later. As CO2 is a positive feedback loop, when the earth cools slightly then CO2 is more easily absorbed, making the earth colder. Positive feedback works both ways. It makes cold periods colder and warm periods warmer."

Hank even talks about a positive feedback loop (That suggest it would just get hotter and hotter, no chance of cooling) yet we have no clue why it got colder?  Maybe we just have no clue!  Despite massive increases in CO2, The Earh has not warmed beyond past rates,  it just does not add up.  Watch Tony Heller videos if you want to ake up...  https://www.youtube.com/user/TonyHeller1"

We feel the same way about you guys of course. Only one of us can be right though and there is a ton of misinfo out there (you may agree on that at least). 


We better make sure our research is thorough considering on your side we could kill most life on earth.
And on my side looking at your proposed solutions.. kill hundreds of millions in developing countries trying to limit Co2... and maybe even kill all life on earth through Co2 starvation, if we found a way to decrease Co2 that much anyway. (though at that point I think we would understand we got it wrong and turn things around). Those are two serious scenarios so yeah we should probably get it right!


There really is a lot to get tripped up on. I've definitely spent enough energy looking into this over the years to have made my head spin, so can understand people ending up at the opposite conclusion I have reached. It's hard to do unbiased and thorough research in the age of information (but not yet the age of truth).... What I don't understand is how you can look at where we are on this graph,
https://geocraft.com/WVFossils/PageMill_Images/image277.gif
and accept enough mental gymnastics ...
-That warmer wouldn't be part of a completely normal cycle.. 
-That we *should* do something to stop it... (overall warmer actually has more benefits)
-and that we *can* do something to stop it.


I mean I guess if you you look at graphs that have a much smaller time scale things can look scary (If I start recording temps tomorrow yeah there would be a lot of ""OMG this is the first time it ever hit this temp!"")... but you should be looking at everything available right? I know there are hundreds of other data points of significance for both our sides... but seriously.. this doesn't give you pause on your point of view? Serious question. I may or may not respond right away as I can't set aside hours a day for youtube comments (at least not all the time lol), but would love to hear answers from anyone on the AGW side."
