"Douglas Engle","2022-12-12T19:55:36Z","Tropospheric water vapor is the cause of earth's greenhouse effect at over 99% to low estimate of 97%.  Global warming was being reported in the mid 1990s at 1.1¬∞C.   It is now 2022 and global warming is still being reported at 1.1¬∞C.   A reasonable estimate for temperature forcing in earth's atmosphere from human emissions of the weak greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is 1/100¬∞C.  Even if the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane in earth's atmosphere were cut in half or doubled it would cause less than 0.1¬∞C in change global temperatures.  The United Nations International Panel on Climate Change reports are very clear and transparent they took their air samples outside the troposphere where earth's greenhouse effect takes place and way into the stratosphere where the strong greenhouse gas water vapor is near zero.  This makes the IPCC reports of no particular value for the discussion of global warming."

"Mujina Umemiya","2022-12-07T00:34:15Z","Current hypothesis is that global warming is due to accumulation of greenhouse gases, that let sun heat in but keep the heat on the earth, like one way valve, in the atmosphere. Scientists agreed that there is such a thing as one-way valve in the air. Anyway, on the basis of this hypothesis, the temperature on the earth goes down only after the amount of greenhouse gases go down, meaning until carbon neural achieved, the temperature keeps on rising, which is around the middle of this Century."

And then the last problem and probably the hardest is how to act..

The problems that we are facing are not spoken about enough and people are not educated enough on the topic to have a civil intelligent conversation. I would say one of the biggest problems in our world when talking about climate change is simply people do not know enough about the topic to have an intelligent conversation. I would also say there is so much misinformation being put out there by some groups that people are getting fooled on social media.

These are theories. Another fact, scientists were off on the agenda of dinosaurs by hundreds of millions of years. We also know that the Earth has gone through many climate changes. Long before humans. Clean the air, it might help cool the planet, despite no evidence of that. Better, clean the air because it's bad for our health.

With cars that cough cancer
On the sun-parched grit
Sand creeps from beaches
Concrete on the road
Under a debt 
The buildings will corrode

Planes sail in and role down the earth
Dry as the wit
No plants it will birth
And out jump the flames to contend for the ground
Fire now no tool, our grip is unsound

So where will we rest as our tiredness grows?
Idealists, denialists. Nobody knows?
Well lets sink the trees in and get on the bus.
Offset the flights or forget them. No fuss!
Get out the bins and recycle, could you?
Put on your layers (and heat on renew)
Try out search engines that say they are planting
If it's false it stops Pichai gallivanting!
And do you need that pair of snazzy new trousers?
I doubt it! Just wear the old ones. They are wowzers!"

Over the years, this environmental issue has increased, for that reason today we can see the horrible consequences. We can see these in our ocean, in the weather, in our food sources and in our health. For me, the biggest consequence is in the weather because the high temperatures caused by climate change generated the thawing of ice, leaving many animals without their natural habits. Also, the high temperatures affect in our skin when we have direct contact with sun, and in our food/ healthy because growing crops becomes more difficult. Is a sad reality but if we care about the planet, we can do the change."

  Advanced X-ray technologies provide insights into a bacterial enzyme that converts methane into liquid fuel
 Methane-eating bacteria are found in harsh environments such as geothermal hot springs.
  Bacteria that metabolize methane (methanotrophs) are found in soil and aquatic environments with little or no oxygen.  In these anaerobic habitats, bacteria play a critical role in carbon recycling.  They convert methane (CH4) into more useful molecules that they and other organisms depend on.

  This research was a collaboration between scientists at Berkeley Lab, University of Minnesota, Stockholm University, SLAC and Diamond Light Source"

The same goes for climate science. Climate scientists agree that burning fossil fuels causes climate change. What should follow, of course, is that policy makers (and the rest of us) act on their advice"

"Jen","2022-02-13T15:26:26Z","Causes of climate change:


Greenhouse effect-  The green house gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapour, nitrous oxide and methane trap heat from the sun. They deplete the ozone layer,the more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the more heat gets trapped and consequently the temperature of the earth increases. Some activities which emit green house gases are:



Burning fossil fuels for production, generating energy, electricity and for other industrial puposes
Defforestation
Mining and other industrial processes
Vehichles 



Effects of climate change:
Icebergs are melting due to the high temperature causing sea-levels to rise. This rise in sea level brings about natural calamities like flood in coastal areas.
Extreme weather conditions like storms, droughts (etc.)
Growing crops become more difficult
The areas in which plants and animals can live shift
Water supplies are diminished
The warmer climate renders and environment that traps and increases the level of smog. This high exposure to smog induces health risks in human beings such as asthma, lung cancer and heart disease.



To mitigate this problem of climate change we can:
use renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy.
Use vehicles which emit green house gases less frequently
Recycle resources
Use resources wisely and not waste
Plant more trees

"Edward Dongres","2021-12-16T07:46:24Z","Our summers shrunk from 3 month to just 3 weeks. Last 20 years we are using increasingly more of the renewable solar energy (stored in that firewood) to heat our homes. Some 5 years ago we started to have fire in the wood stove every month of the year, even July for couple of cold nights. CLEAR sign ice age is coming.  Ice age doesn't make winters any colder. Just summers are shorter and shorter until a point when the old snow never melts completely before new snow falls. And according to Milankovic Cycles this happen regularly every almost 90,000+ years besides, the little ice ages.  Global warm ups? That comes too but always shorter. The warmest climate on record shows in fossils of dragonflies the size of ravens. No ""tipping point"" anywhere. BTW, most flora and fauna is in the tropics. There's a hint, warm good, cold bad. During the next ice age more than half of the 10 billion population (by then) die of starvation and wars over food supply.  We still can't grown food on ice."
"Luis Rosales","2021-12-15T06:31:09Z","Climate change is a problems that we knew was going to happen since the start of the Industrial Revolution, in the year 1880. Understanding that climate change has consequences, to important things in this world like oceans, weather, food, and health. Where growing crops have become more difficult, because of the movement of water, soil, and animals. Having an issues with people health, because of the refinery we have, along with cattle industries, that also have a huge impact on climate change. It seem like many people say that they care about protecting the environment but then do nothing about it? But could be that political, economic, and cultural factors are prohibiting world leaders from agreeing on solutions to global environmental challenges? Because it seems like anthropologist along with some scientists identified what needed to be done to address many of the world‚Äôs pressing environmental problems, but few of the recommended changes had been adopted, but most of them where oppose by political, cultural, and economic forces."
"Mark Southern","2021-12-14T23:17:53Z","The problem is in the title... the causes and effects of climate change.  First, the main driver of climate is the sun and the sun goes through cycles. And then, we are on a planet that spins, and it orbits the sun, and the tilt of the earth and the distance from the sun varies. This is why we have ice ages.  And then on a smaller scale we have ocean currents and other weather patterns that drive shorter term climate changes on the scale of decades.  These are macro drivers of climate.  The increasing of C02 will cause some warming, but its influence will be limited. The more saturated the atmosphere comes with C02, the less proportionally the earth warms.  What is ignored by the climate change gurus, is that increasing C02 is a benefit ....the earth is greening.  Type in 'greening of the earth' and look at NASA or CSIRO.  The other thing this video skirts around...it states that C02 hasn't been this high for 400,000 years (true), but did they explain that the Cambrian period which was associated with explosion of life had C02 levels that were 7x what they are presently?  No?  Why not?  Is there any increase in droughts? Nope (check the data not the video).  Are hurricanes increasing in number of intensity? (Nope)...i could go on.  Are seas rising faster? Yes, since 1990, but at the same rate as 1920s to 1940s.  Ditto temperature.  This really is just a 'fluff' piece to indoctrinate."

According to the information space diagnostics of the ICD, the temperature on the surface of the earth will continuously rise, the earth will begin to dry up and there will be no vegetation on it. On dry land, life is impossible, since there will be no vegetation, there will be no water. People will leave dry regions, abandon their homes, abandon their industries. The problem of drying up the land will soon begin, and in this century it will occupy vast territories. A huge resettlement of people will begin. The war for the land will begin at the end of the century. The number of countries will be halved. The country's power will be determined by the availability of habitable land. According to the ICD forecast, the share of dry territories in the regions will be as follows in 2090: South America - 44%, North America - 75%, Europe - 25%, Asia - 55%, Africa - 3%, Arabian Peninsula - 99%, Antarctica - 11% , Greenland - 55%.

If you want to Study buy A Solar Panel , and Study the energy produced during The Winter , when North America is In Closer proximity to the Sun . As it varies . I wouldn't worry so much about what to do , I would worry how much the atmosphere has been damaged . 
Like the Economy , all We Need to Survive is Truth as a mainstay . In North America , The Truth isn't Owned and Created either . 
  We as a People need to Install honesty as Our Ruling class , or Not .
   It took me a little figuring , Why Govt USA thinks everyone lies , Forms constantly threatening , If u lie , The Govt gonna heist and prison you . 
  I figure They Think everyone lives in A World of Lies like Them . In 1965 , you could buy a Loaf of Wonder Bread , for 39 cents , a big loaf . Now a premium Loaf costs Four Dollars and 49 cents .
  So , I know , The Govt USA knows how to manage an economy . Balancing all that on The Domestic Dollar . amen is all I can say . amen ‚ù§Ô∏è"

To a great extent, they also accept without question the completely outdated and definitively scientifically disproven paradigm of Newtonian Materialism. True Science is a methodology of truth discovery, and not a ""belief system"" as dictated by modern worldly institutions. Some of the foundational hallmarks of Government-grant-money-funded materialistic ""science"" include ignoring entire data sets, and fudging existing data to fit their own deeply entrenched worldview. The emerging modern sciences of Epigenetics and Holistic Biology are just now beginning to turn the tide in such a worldview by rightly incorporating Consciousness and metaphysical understanding into their research methodologies."

"J J","2021-08-16T01:43:47Z","It is very important for the climate scientists, and the public in general, to understand the true effect of CO2 on global warming.. Although CO2 can absorb long wave thermal radiation, it can not block the heat radiation, and its capacity of trapping heat is very limited due to its low specific heat capacity. In addition, due to CO2's very low concentration in the atmosphere, the majority of the thermal radiation would escape to outer space without hit any GHG molecules. People need to rethink how the earth keeps its warmth and prevents from overheating in the same time. It is actually the entire atmosphere that retains the heat energy to keep the earth warm. Since the majority gases in the air do not absorb long wave thermal radiation, they can only get their heat energy through conduction and convection. And the stored heat in the air also shields the thermal radiation flux from the earth‚Äôs surface! The effect of CO2 in global warming is actually neglectable!"

That is, these photons (and others absorbed by CO2) emitted from the surface never reach the top of the atmosphere. In spectroscopic terms, the absorption is saturated.  ""


As such, any additional CO2 since industrialization has no effect on warming, because the Green House Effect of the GHG‚Äôs in the pre-industrial era already reached maximum!

You got your point on the percentage of photon escape to outer space without hitting any GHG molecule, which indeed depends on the projected density, instead of concentrations. However it appears the consensus of climate scientists already did the calculation and found the density of all GHG is so high that no phonon would escape, i.e 100% of radiation would be absorbed by the GHG‚Äôs with its current concentration.

Sea levels in England were apparently going to rise by one foot, 32 cm by the year 2000. Our summers were going to be much hotter and winters much colder. Anyone pointing out that global warming and cooling has fluctuated every few hundred years or so. In Roman times Grapes we‚Äôre grown as far north as Lincoln and in medieval times the Thanes froze every year allowing a market to be held every winter. In the 1940 and 50 snow came every year to the South of England, now it is scarcely seen. Yes our climate if changing as it always has and it has little to do with human activity."

Why do we automatically assume that CO2 is the only factor? Can it be that CO2 might just be one of the hundreds of factors that causes climate change such as the sea, sun, earth rotation, etc., and that we actually don't really know how much humans contribute to climate change? Furthermore, it would be impossible to figure out what our spending of trillions of dollars, not driving cars, flying airplanes, etc., would accomplish in 20 years. I'm open to having my mind changed, but I don't see it as very reasonable and proportional to sacrifice my freedoms for something that we don't even know if it will make any difference - for a problem that we don't really know why it came to be."

The developed nations of the world could provide backing and guarantees for an ""Earth Bond"" that pays 8% annual inflation-adjusted dividends with no limit to the guarantee and no ownership limit like was in place with war bonds. The bond funds would only be used for 2 purposes: 1) projects to improve the health of our planet.
2) provide employment, benefits and fair compensation to the world's poor
Essentially you would employ the world's poor to improve the health of the planet and give plenty of incentive for everyone to invest in these endeavors through a guaranteed annual 8% inflation-adjusted dividend. Everybody wins and nobody feels like they were ""taken from"" like through taxation that never works."

Jesus is the only way to heaven. 
Salvation:-

Confess and repent of all your sins in prayer
Forgive those who have harmed you (this will free you from anger) as Jesus forgave you
Believe Jesus died to blot out your sins and that He is your Saviour 
Believe He rose again 3 days later in the flesh by God's hand
Be baptised fully immersed in water and be baptised in the Holy Spirit
Repent daily
By grace you are saved through Faith (belief)
Live pure and stop sinning

Love you neighbour as yourself and love God with all your heart, soul and mind. Believe Jesus is Lord.

And BTW arctic sea ice reached its so called minimum almost 10 years ago although polar ice caps are the exception in earth climate history not the norm.

Co2 in the atmosphere is a trace  gas, just 410 parts per million, that is 0.00041 of atmosphere.
Of that Co2 a tiny fraction can attributed to manmade Co2, even taking the high figure of warmists it is just 3% of total Co2
3% of 0.00041 is 0.0000123% manmade Co2 as percentage of the atmosphere.
The UK accounts for just 1% of global Co2 output of that manmade carbon which makes UK atmospheric Co2 contributions in total 0.000000123% of atmosphere.
Zero Co2 emissions from the UK will reduce atmospheric Co2 by a maximum of 0.000000123% over centuries.
That is one Billionth of one percent!
Meanwhile China is responsible for more Co2 emissions than the whole Europe and US combined but still has no carbon taxes imposed on it.

Further we are told atmospheric Co2 is at record levels yet for the vast majority of Earths life giving history it has been much higher.
This is why they never show Co2 on the geological scale as it would show the atmosphere is Co2 starved and totally debunk the pseudo science runaway warming propaganda.
For example, in the Cambrian period that gave is renowned for being the period that life most flourished on earth, Co2 levels were 20 times higher than now!
This continued through hundreds of millions years and far from the earth dying it was green and temperate from pole to pole.

I could give a lecture on how the greatest Co2 producing nations  outside the West were left exempt of all climate policy (How strange when the Earth is allegedly about to die?)
And the global elite who own over half the worlds entire wealth between them fund the think tanks that inform the ICPP moved industry and invested in those nations causing them build many thousands of dirty coal plants as the West shut their expensive clean burning plants down causing global Co2 emissions to rise not fall and China to be comfortably the greatest polluter on Earth making them trillions in the process and deindustrialising the West which could not hope to compete weighed down by expensive electricity and red tape and carbon taxes.
But why bother, the deniers are going to deny, they have been brainwashed since being children with this BS which is entirely designed to enrich and empower just a few people and ultimately bring in global technocratic governance some of which we are already under.

"Bluesbr0ther","2021-03-04T01:10:31Z","Since you like to ''lecture'' , how about sticking to facts.
It does not matter what % of the CO2 is manmade, we still caused all the CO2 increase.
If nature emits 780GT of CO2 and we emit 40GT and Earth's natural uptake is 790 GT then 30GT ends in the atmosphere with our emissions and zero ends in the atmosphere if we don't emit anything.
Furthermore , you can say that the Cambrian period was a time where life flourished which is partly correct but in that story there is also the fact that there was no living creatures on land , ALL the animals were ocean animals.
And the CO2 came from massive volcanic eruptions worldwide caused by Earth's continents crashing into each other.
The high CO2 ppm caused the oceans to drop in PH value which resulted in mass extinctions again.
Life didn't begin to flourish again until the ppm started to drop."

I have 3 degrees--MS in earth science, minor in geology. 110 credits across the earth science curriculum. Entropy indeed influences microclimates-that's why cities are complaining of heat buildup. But the fact of the matter is you are the one that just buys into this stuff & believes much like the Holy See did in Galileo time, that mankind just got to be the center of attention. I'm well versed in my fields & I'm always exploring the podcasts & lit. produced by scientists who don't have a political agenda."

And what scientific background do you exactly have? If you claim that you are the one that can critically reason and I don't, it would be painful if I can refute your reasoning. You can explain what entropy is, but that doesn't prove your point. I know what entropy and the second law of thermodynamics are. In no way or form do they make AGW impossible. If you want to try to prove otherwise: do it and not by just stating some concepts. 

And why am I running on emotions? I'm not discussing the behaviour of politicians like you do, nor am I using an ad hominem. You are the one that is using fallacies in your reasoning."
"Kim Libera","2021-02-05T15:11:44Z","@YraxZovaldo I think you're the one running on emotion as politicians do. I have the science background to critically reason; you don't. You're simply one of the trolls out there to promote the alarmism.  Entropy is defined as the trend toward any energy-producing process or any metabolic process toward disorder, chaos. waste energy-aka heat. The simplest example is a lightbulb-a device designed to process light energy. After a few minutes of being lit, that energy is not 100% efficient. There is a loss--called entropy-this energy is lost in the form of heat.  Similar with a distance runner, most of the ATP production does not go to mechanical motion; it is channeled out in the form of waste heat. What occurs when the body has waste heat--it sweats. It only cools with the evaporation of that sweat. Yet another example, did you know that T-Storms & hurricanes are nature's ways of ridding the planet of entropy.  The entropy buildup induced by the sun's radiation over a differentiated surface."

"Kim Libera","2021-02-05T14:51:25Z","@YraxZovaldo Human activity can influence microclimates but it cannot facilitate the whole atmosphere-all 5 layers up to orbit. But a good part of this is called entropy & one cannot avoid the 2nd law of thermodynamics. While certainly politicians do not want us to have cars or use jets & apparently not use a furnace, they themselves will not make that sacrifice. They have rested their argument into this: If A, then B. So they begin w/ the premise that CO2 is bad. Yet since the industrial rev. societies have progressed by allowing us to have light to see, ac to keep cool, heat to keep warm, the ability to cook, the ability to run electric currents. They want us back in the Stone Age under a false guise that the planet is in jeopardy. This is a charade for carbon markets. While certainly the world's population is much larger, don't forget not everyone has or uses a car-typically the very poor regions of the world. Likewise not every region of the world requires a furnace-Africa, SE Asia, Oceania, a good part of South America, & the southern countries of the Eurasian belt. So given that the whole world is not putting out a lot of CO2  as it relates to using furnaces for heat."

The theme here is that any economic progress here that began in the industrial revolution was then a bad thing to develop.  They also don't mention that co2 is absrobed in 4 distinct infrared wavelengths, not across the whole spectrume. Climate change is not facilitated by humans. Polluton is.

"WF Frantz","2021-01-22T06:50:43Z","Scientists and the IPCC have known for years that CO2 has three climate change properties: one that warms (the greenhouse gas effect) and two that cool (the flora and aerosol effects). While there have been dozens of studies on the greenhouse gas effect, there have only been five on the total effect of CO2. All five concluded the same thing. CO2 cools more than it warms. The last study that included 62+ years of real-time records and hourly and monthly datasets from every international climate institute (NASA, NOAA, Berkeley, Hadley, York, World Meteorological Organization (Tokyo), RSS, UAH, and Mauna Loa Observatory found that the net effects of water vapor and methane force climate change. But, the total effect of CO2 (greenhouse, flora, and aerosol effects combined) is to anti-force climate. I really feel sorry for all the organizations that discounted flora and aerosol effects and the educators that now have to admit that they don't always teach what is real."

How do you know that land masses have moved around the globe? We were not around back then?  Do you begin to notice the inconsistency in your argumentation? 

I'm not assuming that CO2 is higher now because of Al Gore. This way of making arguments is very annoying. I can also just keep on repeating that you only listen to big oil companies and believe what they say without any critical thought. That would however be untrue and a weak form of making an argument. So stop assuming that I believe CO2 is higher now because of Al Gore. 

""And specifically the Hadean/Archaen Eras had much more CO2 than the period of the Industrial Revolution onward. You cannot measure the gigatons of the previous eons because we were not around back then.""
In sentence 2 you are saying that we can't measure historic CO2 levels and in sentence 1 you say we can? What is it? Make up your mind. 

I don't know what Kerry said. I don't care. There are also people claiming that the atmosphere has no influence on the climate and that it is only the sun and nothing else. So people saying a lot of stupid stuff. CO2 itself is not catastrophic but a changing climate can be quite a problem. The main problem is that you probably don't react to what people are saying. Can you point me out to someone who is saying that we are going to suffocate? Can you name a specific person? Because if you can't, you are making a strawman again."
"Kim Libera","2021-02-04T23:41:27Z","@YraxZovaldo I'm an earth scientist, specialty geology. You are assuming CO2 is higher now b/c of all the attention Al Gore has brought to the issue. His claim is A, then B. The fact is when people make a claim of we have more CO2 than there ever has been-people are only relying on info being presented in the present. They are not aware Earth is 4.5 GA. And specifically the Hadean/Archaen Eras had much more CO2 than the period of the Industrial Revolution onward. You cannot measure the gigatons of the previous eons because we were not around back then. Remember we have a very deep ocean, we have a pretty atmosphere, & then there is the land & the rocks. I'm very well aware of plate tectonics; most of the public is not. They do not know that the land masses have moved around the globe & that ocean basins have opened & closed. BTW whenever there is radioactive decay & significant plate movement as in a seismic event, there is also the release of heat. See Gore's argument is he starts out w/ the premise that CO2 is bad & that he perceives a warming which in his mind must be caused by CO2 & must be catastrophic. Where he is wrong is CO2 follows any warming, not precedes it. Addtionally he is all wrapped in the carbon markets & his solar panels & his goal is just to get people to get into that. I'd say leave it up to the market & not congressmen. My point about the vitamins & the volcanos, again the media is pushing a cass that CO2 is so catastrophic for us-in fact john kerry was just saying that today that we have only a few years left. And I'm sitting here laughing. People think we're all going to suffocate or something. They don't know how to react to it. The point with vitamin D is that the awful piece of radiation known as UV also provides a beneficial effect in that this is what stimulates growth of it in the skin. No catastrophe.  Just like volcanos.  Often the source of many natural hazards, yet volcanos also create land crust for people to live on & many actual utilize the volcanic soils to grow things.  So my point is there is no need for alarmism. The system has buffers."
"YraxZovaldo","2021-02-04T22:27:37Z","@Kim Libera 
Proxy data is a thing. This is a stupid argument and you know it. We can quite accurately measure past CO2 concentrations. Are you also going to deny the movement of tectonic plates and evolution because we ""weren't around""? 

Do you know what a strawman argument is? You are saying: ""But what would you have those people do-not use a furnace. That's absurd. "". No one is saying that people in Canada or Russia should use a furnace or heating. You are making up an exaggeration instead of reacting to the actual arguments. You using that exaggeration to claim the argument I'm making is absurd. This is precisely what a strawman argument is. If you claim I made a strawman argument, point it out. 

I don't understand the relevance of vitamins and vulcanos."
"Kim Libera","2021-02-04T20:57:58Z","@YraxZovaldo Incorrect. You are the one using the strawman. How do you know the CO2 concentration at any point in the past-were you around then? Were you around in the Hadean & Archean Eras or the Proterozoic Era or the Carboniferous Periods.  Just the mere presence of a thing does not make it catastrophically alarmist. E.g. let's look at 2 things:  UV radiation & ozone.  Ozone (O3) absorbs UV radiation which as you know gives us a sunburn & skin cancer. This is b/c UV rays, being on the short end, have higher frequency & hence more energy laws written by Planck & Boltzmann. However, did you also know that one's vitamin D, a necessary vitamin for building immunity is made with the direct effect of UV rays. Another example.  volcanos. Are they  constructive or destructive? Well they are actually both. Depending on the type of volcano & type of eruption, if you live near one you could possibly be hit by hot debris, sustain smoke inhalation, or be caught in a hot lava flow. There are also possible hazards of noxious gases & cuts to the eye from glass.  However, much of the planet's land was created by the constructive effects of volcanos creating land (just watch films of Hawaii).  In fact, a new island is forming in the Hawaiian chain.  Currently a seamount."
"YraxZovaldo","2021-02-04T20:14:23Z","@Kim Libera 
Yes, CO2 is trace gas. And what is the point you are trying to make again? That because something is a trace gas it can't contribute to the greenhouse effect? So what molecules do contribute to the greenhouse effect? Because all the other greenhouse gasses are also trace gases. 

If the carbon cycle is in balance why do we have the highest CO2 concentration in at least the last 3 million years? 

So you don't think poverty exist and don't think it is a problem?  Of course, people in Russia and Canada should be using heating. You are simply using faulty logic by making a strawman argument."

"WF Frantz","2022-02-11T17:24:44Z","@Ravetastic. There are many papers about the topics listed here: co-aerosols of CO2, the aerosol effect on climate, the CO2 effect on C3 and C4 type flora, the flora effect on climate, the CO2 greenhouse gas warming effect on climate, CO2's net effect on climate. On which topic were you searching?"
"WF Frantz","2022-02-11T17:18:41Z","@YraxZovaldo Type the following into a search engine. ""NASA flora cooling"". NASA explains it well within the context of the political narrative (they need funding too) that CO2 is causing global warming. There are many papers to review. Not surprising. The surprising thing is that scientists are not publishing the actual why. At the photon level, the ""effective"" albedo of a green leaf is higher than the albedo of an ice shelf. Effective is in quotes because one needs to add together photons that are reflected with photons that cool versus heat."
"WF Frantz","2022-02-11T17:11:10Z","@YraxZovaldo Another tenet of science is to test the actual theory. Let's be concise. Take the theory that ""a doubling of CO2 will cause climate change greater than 1%"". Then a modeler regresses a bunch of variables against global temperature. If so, they tested nothing because they didn't test the theory. The theory clearly states ""doubling"" and ""change"". Both mean changes. So any regressive model needs to at a minimum (best practices requires more) to test changes at various lags to test if X causes Y. This single issue is the biggest downfall of some climate scientists that believe that CO2 causes climate change. Redo the regression using changes. Redo it using the records from every climate center in the world. All agree. CO2 does not cause climate change."
"WF Frantz","2022-02-11T17:03:01Z","@YraxZovaldo If a paper supports my position, like this one that states that aerosols cool, one needs to apply basic tenets of science. To definitively determine if X causes Y, one can only use real-time records of our climate. This is true for those trying to prove that aerosols cause cooling, if CO2 causes cooling, or if CO2 causes warming. Models reflect our understanding of climate. They cannot be used to prove or disprove theory. This paper uses a model, not real-time climate records. Thus, even though I would want it to be, it is not supporting evidence."
"WF Frantz","2022-02-11T16:55:03Z","@YraxZovaldo Correct. But read carefully. Associated. Is anthropogenic CO2 is inseparable from associated aerosols? These co-aerosol effects are as fast acting as the greenhouse effect (nanoseconds to about a month for full saturation). This neutralizes the CO2's immediate effect. But, co-aerosols wear off with time faster than CO2. So over time, the CO2 apparent effect increases. But, by then, the green effect (growing life that cools) dominates. It's an interesting interaction of systems."

"YraxZovaldo","2021-02-05T07:25:43Z","@typedef04 There is 6.25% difference in the increase from that time period in 2019 and 2020. That is extremely close to the 6.4% drop in emissions in 2020. So maybe the problem is that you just keep ignoring the fact that there was a very small change in CO2 emissions in 2020 but still expect huge changes in the graph about CO2 levels."
"typedef04","2021-02-05T00:26:12Z","@YraxZovaldo It looks like humans has no affect on trend."
"YraxZovaldo","2021-02-04T22:36:24Z","@typedef04 As nice as I am I looked at the data from NASA. The difference in CO2 levels between 15-2-2020 and 16-12-2020 was 1.5 ppm. The difference between 15-2-2019 and 16-12-2019 was 1.6 ppm. So the previous year there was a bigger increase in the same time span. Of course it is useless to zoom in to the data in such a manner, but you asked for it."
"typedef04","2021-02-04T20:41:04Z","@YraxZovaldo It is incorrect to say C02 is invisible. For human eye yes, for Satellites when it takes images in different spectrum is ""visible"".  Again, I mentioned it before   I brought Himalaya example only to show the magnitude of slowing emission.
 I disagree when production of C02 goes down total concentration is goes up. At least angle of increase has to change. It didn't."
"YraxZovaldo","2021-02-04T17:15:51Z","@typedef04 CO2 is invisible so that doesn't influence if you could see the Himalaya or not. 
First of all, the atmosphere is complex. CO2 is continually exchanged between the atmosphere, oceans, plants, etc. So yes the exact effect of a few months of less CO2 emissions might not be extremely visible in the CO2 concentration. 
Secondly, if we simplify it, the CO2 concentration would only stop increasing if we would completely stop C02 emissions. We didn't. World wide CO2 emissions fell by 6.4% in 2020. That is not a very big change and that would be very hard to see on a graph."

"Ele For College","2020-11-27T04:57:33Z","@Dippz 22 Ah, thank you for the polite tone. But I wasn't trying to make ""everything"" business. This issue is serious, and I'm not saying that people shouldn't make jokes, except making jokes directed toward this increasingly convoluted issue shows how lackadaisical people can be. Along with the pandemic and global warming, there will be more problems including breakouts or more diseases. Even if the pandemic vaccine comes out, with the weather exacerbating, people will have to wear masks whenever they go outside forever until global warming ceases, which is unlikely. Before this problem reaches its capacity, we must help stop it. I urge you to. Thank you again if you read all this."
"Dippz 22","2020-11-18T19:24:59Z","‚Äã@Ele For College People like you are tho? Listen I get maybe you don't like people joking about it, but it is obviously helping nobody by you taking it seriously. I know you probably don't care but just because something is serious, doesn't mean it has to be all business‚Äì¬†and telling someone they aren't helping because they joke around makes it sound like you want to try and make yourself out to be a ""greater than thou"" person, when you don't know if this persons trying to change the world as well. They may also just not believe in climate change but either way it's better to just take jokes as jokes, and maybe list some important info underneath the comment. I get you probably weren't trying to be rude, and you just wanted people to understand the importance of this issue though."

"Prashant Wason","2020-09-20T18:17:30Z","Actually its a lot more than that. You're also looking at forced human migration,  more frequent droughts, more widespread tropical diseases. 

Overall, global warming will not make humanity go extinct. Our way of life, maybe. Only the wealthiest people would walk out of it relatively unscathed. 

How much time we got? Well, the current CO2 that we've added is not gonna go back down to preindustrial levels for over a 1000 years naturally. In that sense we're probably too late. We still have, at our current rate of emissions, about 10 years to go carbon neutral, and negative from there before the impact becomes civilisation threatning."

Its not...not the current one at least / 

"" But the problem is that we start measuring the temps of the earth right at a cool earth season""

Thats not true at all. We are in an interglacial ...a warm period within the current ice age (which started 2+ million years ago)...This interglacial started about 11k years ago and termperature actually fell slightl since then...

""And in past it even was way hotter, so it may will be even hotter.""

IS was hotter when Co2 levels were higher...And the positions of the continents were different

""Could that be reasonable?""

no becaue the  only physical reason that could explain the curernt warming is our Co2 emissions"

assume all eight billion people on the planet can switch over to some 
hippy, local trade, lifestyle. it will never happen, human civilization 
is too vast. most environmentalist are more corrupt than the 
corporations they persecute, always griping for more money without any 
thought of an endgame. humans arnt going to rollback on civilization 
like the mayans did, theres only a forward path. and that path is off

The other 97% is contributed by nature.   The more likely culprit is solar cycles and the impacts of variances in the sun's magnetic field on our climate.   Check our solar maximums and solar minimums for yourself and see what you think.  I found it pretty compelling, myself."

Don't you want that your children breath clean air on the street poisoned with fossil cars today so they do not have to die in war for oil in some middle East country? Electric vehicles do not poison your child lungs at the street where they need to breath. 
Did you know that Tesla car EV company worth is 2 times of Ford and GM combined today?

However, if the water vapor turns into clouds, they reflect incoming energy from the sun and cool the surface of the earth."

Short of all out war GHG pollution cannot be stopped  without  advanced techniques. There is energy technologies that allow us  collect solar power and beam it too the earth,  There is fuel for pollution free, radio active free fusion power in large quantities on the Moon. There is plentiful natural gas thar reduces GHG's 50% , that  will help transition us through and  replace coal rapidly by natural economics if we stood aside.There is means to scrub CO2 from the atmosphere but must be developed.    The answer is to progress as fast as we can science/technology.
   Were constantly improving in efficiency, our per capita GHG's in the USA is steadily declining, faster than anywhere else I believe."

Every 12,460 years half the precessional Great Year our solar system crosses over the galaxies double torus electromagnetic equator/plane causing plasma bursts from the reconnection of the Sun's magnetosphere, Asteroid/comet impacts from crossing the galaxies toroid asteroid kuipers belt, and E-W global Tsunami's due to the increased EM gravitational pull at the center of the galactic plane.

Obliquity magnetic north changes reference our position to the galactic bulge in 4 quadrants e-w declination.
Eccentricity perihelion/aphelion happens with the galactic bulge every 120,000 years half a full rotation of the galactic bulge.

Earth is a closed loop that self regulates CO2 with life. Temperature rises first causing frozen CO2 to thaw rising CO2 second. Cause and effect. Not cart before the horse forcing or green house effect.

"Marsh","2019-10-31T00:18:26Z","No ,  CO2 based Climate Change, is not my religion.
Sea Levels have risen  ; one of the biggest lies in the Melting agenda. 

The empirical ""evidence"" destroys any ""certainty"" of Global Warming;
remember that Antarctica was at it's greatest ""Ice Mass"" just five years ago & lowest recorded temperature (Antarctica holds 90% world Ice).
We have experienced ""more SNOW"" during our Winters around the globe over the past five years than any average, covering previous decades.

The panic merchants rant on how Warm the Pacific Ocean has become but ignore any contradictory evidence like; the Atlantic is cooling more. Then all the irresponsible doomsday predictions of Seas Rising along with other fuxtwit assertions that failed the GW agenda. We should not forget the corruption of ""data tampering & cherry picking"" of observations to leverage the nonsense of warmest year (no,, with the coldest Winters; even the naive should see it can't honestly average that way).
The empirical evidence reveals regional changes; warming & cooling.!

CO2 is NOT a pollutant..!  We need every bit of the 400 ppm in the atmosphere or we will not Grow enough food with rising populations.
Plants grow faster with more CO2 , they also cope better with any temperature rise.  It is also a fact , for many regions of the World, the crops have a critical length of season before harvest. If the CO2 falls to 300 ppm we are in serious trouble; at 250 ppm it will be starvation...  people need to look at the consequence of CO2 shortage.
Unlike any hypothetical Warming assertion ; lowering CO2 is a genuine risk.

The Greenhouse effect is the ""catch cry"" for all the obsessive compulsives & it's good to see that at least ""water vapour"" is understood to be a greater driver... but that is just a focus on Greenhouse.  There're numerous factors that drive the Climate to a much greater extent covering Natural Variability.   A solar maxima / minima cycle  will far exceed  any limited forcing from CO2  but the ""warming mantra"" only follows the Greenhouse?
And,, I too was a believer in AGW , years ago ; but I woke up to the reality."

The largest study to date, Cook et al. (2013), attempted to categorize 11,944 abstracts [brief summaries] of papers (not entire papers) to their level of endorsement of AGW and found that 7,930 (66%) held no position on AGW, while only 64 papers (0.5%) explicitly endorsed and quantified AGW as +50% (humans are the primary cause). A later analysis by Legates et al. (2013) found there to be only 41 papers (0.3%) that supported such definition. Cook et al.'s methodology was so fatally flawed that they falsely classified skeptic papers as endorsing the 97% consensus, apparently believing to know more about the papers than their authors. The second part of Cook et al. (2013), the author self-ratings simply confirmed the worthlessness of their methodology, as they were not representative of the sample since only 4% of the authors (1,189 of 29,083) rated their own papers and, out of these, 63% disagreed with the abstract ratings. All the other ""97% consensus"" studies - e.g. Doran & Zimmerman (2009), Anderegg et al. (2010) and Oreskes (2004) - have been refuted by peer-reviews."

"Yuri Sucupira","2020-01-21T00:23:49Z","@Micheal Carney As the paper states:
_""The artificial decoupling between radiative and convective heat-transfer processes adopted in climate models leads to mathematically and physically incorrect solutions with regard to surface temperature""_
_""(...) convection (and especially the moist one) is orders of magnitude more efficient in transferring energy than LW radiation""_
_""(...) heat preferentially travels along the path of least resistance""_
The Nikolov-Zeller PTE Effect theory completely accounts for why the Earth and other celestial bodies with an atmosphere are warmer than they would be without their atmospheres. It replaces the current ""Greenhouse Gas Effect"" (radiation decoupled from the quantum physics of elastic shock) hypothesis that *has never been empirically proven in the last 190 years since it was first postulated.*
Similar to the way a diesel engine's piston compresses gases creating pressure that enhances the existing heat in each cylinder to reach the temperature needed to ignite the fuel, the huge mass of the Earth's atmosphere's gas molecules being compressed by the natural pull of gravity provides the constant Pressure-induced Thermal Enhancement (PTE) of the available Solar Heat-Energy, which results in the _PTE Greenhouse Effect_ that keeps our planet habitably warmer than it would be without an atmosphere (i.e. a global mean surface temperature of approximately 58¬∞F or 14¬∞C with our atmosphere, versus a global mean surface temperature below 0¬∞F or -17¬∞C without an atmosphere).
This study is orders of magnitude more precise than any IPCC study and report."

"kok fah chong","2019-10-25T04:43:41Z","No doubt that emission of carbon dioxide has increased¬†since industrialization. It is true that summer is scorching hot, but winter is freezing cold. At least this tells us that the drastic climate change is not solely due to carbon dioxide emission. Due to the fact that the solar system is constantly shifting outwardly away from the center of the universe that subsequently leading to global cooling effect on earth where atoms have better appetite for photons. Therefore during a¬†moonless night, the surroundings will be enveloped with complete darkness as atoms are now hungry for more photons. Air molecules that now able to stockpile more stationary photons will cause wind speeds to increase further that super hurricanes are common¬† occurrences. Rainfall is erratic due to the capability of stronger wind speeds to snowball clouds that some places will be inundated with excess rainfall while other places have drought. In conclusion, global cooling is already at our doorstep and we need to deal with it by planting more trees to moderate its severe effects. If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries. In God I trust. ."

You will see we are at the limit of sustainability as far as food production is concerned. That is without including billions of hectares used to farm cattle and the biggest waste of land, grape and grain for alcohol production! (I love wine and beer, but if we really are pushed, it must be better to grow food than grapes?)
This means that over population is the problem. In the last 40 years the world population has doubled. So we need to DOUBLE the production of EVERYTHING, Literally! In the supermarket that means the manager orders 2 tonnes of potatoes instead of one tonne! 50,000 litres of milk instead of 25000, 100,000 eggs instead of 50,000, 20,000 loaves of bread instead of 10,000. The electric company had to make another power station for everyone already running, don't bore me with wind etc. They only account for 15% now after spending massively disproportionate amounts on the stupid things! Do you not think this DOUBLED PRODUCTION AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION may have a little bit to do with the increased co2 emissions? Not that I agree they are the cause of the EVER SO SLIGHT warming anyway!

We‚Äôd never heard of the greenhouse effect at that time, but we knew that a blanket of clouds (water vapor) would slow down the escape of Earth‚Äôs heat.

My dad had already flooded the ground around the trees and prepped his smudge pots to be lit at the appropriate moment (for the blanketing effect of carbon laden air).

As the thermometer continued to slowly but surely drop, we nervously sat listening to the reports on the radio. Then, just as temperatures neared freezing, a bank of clouds moved in over the region and the rate of temperature decrease slowed and stopped at 30 degrees (F.). An hour later, the sun peeked over the horizon and very slowly the temperature began to rise. Damage to the fruit and trees was avoided without having lit the smudge pots.

My point is that even though some people may not believe in the greenhouse effect, they‚Äôre almost certainly not citrus growers.

BBC - Naval College CAL representative ""ice-free by 2013""
National Sonai Status Center- David Barber/Mark Serise and Sweden's expert on CC U. Manatova in 2007 ""north pole ice-free by 2008""

In 72 there was a lot less ice than 79.
In 45 there was a lot of warming. 
In 58 arctic temp plunged and there was cooling till 1970

"Frey Faust","2019-07-23T06:15:59Z","The climate catastrophists make several fatal errors when they argue for their POV. 1. They are completely unskeptical about a subject which is very obviously controversial among climate scientists and earth scientists in general. There is no such thing as a partial consensus. Consensus is total or it is not consensus. Consensus is a matter of opinion, not scientific protocol for proof. Absolute conviction in a scientist is already suspicious, but when its about a controversial subject, that discredits them utterly. 2. They want to have us all believe that the trace of a trace gas that humans contribute to is the driver for a gigantic, chaotic system with enormous forces and thousands of contributing elements. They look at the entire past and present dynamics and imagine co2 everywhere. This is not science. 3. The scientists at the IPCC were caught red handed in the early 2000s cooking the graphs to make the past temperature record colder and steady. They should all have been fired, but were never punished. When Catastrophic AGW people make claims and use materials from the IPCC, they cannot be taken seriously. 4. The Catastrophists attempt to make co2 seem toxic. Co2 is not a toxin, any more than oxygen. Co2 is as vital to life on the planet as oxygen and water. 400 ppm is already homeopathic compared to periods in the past when it was 1000s of ppm and life was flourishing. 150 ppm is the level at which all life would and has died. At 400 ppm, the current global level is LOW. 600 is common under a forest canopy. 2k to 3k on a submarine or in the space station. Co2 is pumped into actual greenhouses at 1000s of ppm because it helps with photosynth and water uptake. Without Co2 we would not be able to digest or breathe. 5. They claim that the oil companies are holding back research and are buying off their opposition. Actually, the oil industry has its head down and is funding alternative energy research and giving a lot to the IPCC. The real catastrophy is the one these snake oil salesmen would instigate if they were successful at making everyone hysterical enough to panic. Not to mention the billions they are siphoning up in tax dollars for their phony models and ridiculous prognostications, not one of which has come true. And this is the last and most damning evidence of the lie, the absolutely stunning record of failed predictions over the last 30 years. A very important aspect of any scientific theory is that it must predict effects. When the predictions fail, the theory has been disproven."

"Niranjan Sankar","2019-07-10T06:54:35Z","The only practical, easy and best solution is planting trees on a regular basis. Practically, u can't shut down the usage of vehicles, u can just control it's usage. And when it comes to aeroplanes, u can't control their usage as, if u need to take very long routes, practically the best option is aeroplane only..No one will be willing to take car or train and travel for long hours if u had money or if u had to switch nations.. Here's a point to note.. Pollution can be called pollution ONLY IF THE LEVEL OF EMISSIONS ""EXCEED"" A LIMIT..  So  the negative effect of excess CO2 emission can be compensated only by planting trees ""regularly"", which is not a difficult task.. Co2 Gas emission is not the real problem, only it's ""amount"" is the problem"

The story was about the nearly 100 years of falling global temperatures and how the rate of the fall was increasing. A graduate student told me a few years ago that that Earth is the hottest it has been in 396 years! I replied great! That means the Earth is now cooler than it was the year before the Mayflower landed with the Pilgrims in 1620. She said, it sounds crazy when I say it that way.

The assertion that the Earth would be 33¬∞K colder without Greenhouse Gases by IPCC reports seems to ignore atmospheric autocompression which accounts for nearly all of the 33¬∞K warming. This phenomenon explains the temperature of planets in the solar system (the ones with enough atmospheric pressure), including Venus where the temperature has been reported to be caused by a runaway greenhouse effect by many news organizations.

The greenhouse effect exists, but it has a very minor impact on surface temperature. Much smaller than what the IPCC reports claim. Temperature forcing by doubling CO2 concentrations is much lower than the range of 3-4.5¬∞K."

""When meteorologists take an average of temperatures around the globe, they find that the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades. The trend shows no indication of reversing. Climatological Cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive, for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age.""

"mattio79","2019-03-07T09:15:04Z","100% of the temperature ""readings"" that are in the ""Climate change"" charts are from models that are parameterized around an assumption of a 3x multiplier of CO2 concentration to temperature change. There's one major, glaring issue with this. Clouds.  When temperature rises, water vaporizes. Those vapors climb up to the top of the troposphere and cool down due to the rapidly dissipating atmospheric pressure and condense into clouds. 40-60% of the radiation that they block is reflected back into space, providing a damping effect on the temperature. the ACTUAL amplifier of CO2 concentration to temperature increase, therefore, is 0.5x.  2019's global temperature is EXACTLY the same as it was in 1978 when they started measuring the temperature the most accurate way that we have devised thus far, via Satellite.  prior to 1978, there were FAR warmer periods, and many other colder periods.  36 of the 37 models produced by the ""scientists"" use the parameterized inputs with the assumptions that were disproved by recent measurements taken by weather balloons in 2018.  Arctic Sea Ice is increasing in thickness, but reducing in area. Antarctic sea ice is increasing in thickness AND area. the total net change in ice volume is 80 million tons/year increase. it has been steadily rising since 1931, where it was at a far lower volume than it is right now.  The other hypothesis of the ""pause"" in ""Global Warming"" (hence the name change that same year) is that the ocean was ""consuming the heat"". that was also disproven when they sent sensors from buoys into the depths. there was observed a linear decrease in temperature relative to depth, as it was with the weather balloons' measurements when they hypothesized that there were ""hot-spots""  in the upper atmosphere, which were also disproven.  The Earth's Atmosphere is a self-balancing system and bucks the universal truth of increased entropy because of the SUN injecting 15,000X the necessary energy to maintain a constant system."

Since then the earth is getting warmer, in fact, every year is getting warmer, slowly, but steady, and just as we know from our own body, 2¬∞C (or 5¬∞F) can make a living person with fever, make a dying person with fever.

We do not have all the answers yet, for example storaging energy is a problem without a solution right now. But we need to act now. The example you gave with oxygen slowly killing us is not really comperable, since we still need oxygen to survive, while the effects of CO2 and other Greenhouse gases are killing us without being crutial for our life (except of course a certian level of Greenhouse gases we need to keep our atmosphere going, but thats not what we have to worry about now)"

CO2 can't affect the climate because it already holds back 100% of the thermal radiation in its frequency range together with H2O.
So the energetic balance can not be affected by an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
We know this since in 1900 Knut √Öngstr√∂m (son of Anders √Öngstr√∂m) made his measurements on this topic!
Look at the Atmospheric Transmission Curve of the earth and you can recognize yourself that the effect is saturated."

At 0:56 you show a graph presenting the increase of temperature over the years while saying that the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have increased by more than a third. While that seems to indicate we are affecting it, you later say ""While Earth's climate has fluctuated in the past, atmospheric carbon dioxide hasn't reached today's levels in hundreds of thousands of years."" To me, who again knows nothing of the subject, you are saying that there's no connection between carbon dioxide levels and climate change. If the Earth's climate has been changing before we were even here, then how do we know that the levels of carbon dioxide are affecting the climate at all? Also, you say the levels have increased by more than a third, but more than a third doesn't tell me anything. How much was there to begin with? 1.33 multiplied by a small number still is a pretty small number. Was the level high enough to make ""more than a third"" have that much of an impact? As an innocent bystander, your argument for climate change being affected by the increase of carbon dioxide levels could have been done better."

So, the demand is increasing day by day. With increasing population and increased per capita meat consumption, the rate of deforestation is increasing every day as well. It is expected that by 2018, the beef export will increase 93 percent, thereby increasing Brazil‚Äôs beef market share of world exports to 61 percent. Beef is the most carbon-intensive form of meat production on the planet. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization finds that beef production gives rise to more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry)"

If thermometers are computer models sure? The only temperature reconstruction that didn't show warming was RSS which virtually every skeptic referred to and some still to this day. The only problem is that they'll refer to a 2015 version of RSS since it was discovered and verified by a skeptic that RSS which is based on satellite models for temperature had wrong values for the diurnal shift and since mid 2016 it has shown warming like every other reconstruction which uses thermometers. The great irony being that if you rely on RSS you rely on satellite models to estimate temperature and hope it's somehow more accurate than a thermometer.

I also find it interesting that people still use 1998 as the start point for this claim. It was near the highest solar maximum in recent history with the strongest El Nino on record meaning that no following year should even be close to it considering the sun has been less active since then if CO2 has such a little affect on the atmosphere, yet we're still beating 1998 for record global surface temperatures with a weaker sun."

For makes over 26,000 different things. we will just talk about hemp bio fossil fuel right now. 1 acre of hemp can produce, enough bile fossil fuel to fuel 10,000 vehicles for a year at about a dollar a gallon.  Hemp bio fossil fuel releases the same amount of carbon dioxide un oxygenated air) per mile as a person does when the exhale.  Versus coal oil and gas sand oil ethanol which released tens of millions of years worth of petrified death per mile.   A couple more examples! Hemp has been proven, to be 10 times stronger and 30% lighter than steel stronger and lighter than concrete stronger and lighter than brick.  Easier to work with on-site far more versatile, not to mention you could use it as much as you would like or need. Without leaving any excess toxic waste behind.  So we could rebuild America stronger later cheaper faster than any people have ever built a city town or country.  The real sales pitch.  That sold me by using Hamp!! For everything we can we will be improving and maintaining the quality of our air water food and landscapes( to groundbreaking high standards of quality)  for 1 acre of hemp! Produces 3 to 4 times the amount of oxygen as 1 acre of trees, at the same time it sucks in 3 to 4 times the amount of carbon dioxide as a acre of trees plus it rejuvenates and replenishes the soil back to Garden of paradise type quality after every harvest.  Even, if the land has been previously, stripped robbed and depleted of all its value from overharvesting things like cotton and corn.  Hemp has even been successfully grown on radiated soil.  Hemp has  the same nutritional value, as rice corn and beans wheat barley and milk.

"Vamshidhar O","2017-09-02T23:51:17Z","Most powerful greenhouse gas is water vapour,  is there any additional water vapor adding to earth's amosphere..even adds up, they condense and fall back to earth by seasonal cycles.... so the next most greenhouse gases to consider are co2 and CH4.... which are adding up in huge amounts in earth atmosphere due to burning fossil fuels and meat eaters... and climate scientists think the cause of global warming....because they stay in gaseous state all the time and trap reflected sun energy.

Also even Co2 is not causing global warming.... burning fossils fuels is not just about Co2...I agree Co2 is not pollutant...but they produce lot of harmful substances....

Coal combustion releases nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM), mercury, and dozens of other substances known to be hazardous to human health.

Diesel common pollutants include unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) or particulate matter (PM)

Petrol pollutants carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, un-burnt hydrocarbons and particulate matter.

The problem is they all are air pollutants, not solid ones like coming out of batteries which can be stored and recycled efficiently...they all cause serious air pollution which we inhale daily...

Even CO2 is not causing global warming..we need to get away from fossil fuels and find alternative sources of energy..

 Pollution from fossil tech is at all levels i.e. extraction, tech manufacturing, transportation and while usage....Also it cannot be recycled easily...

Pollution from renewable tech is only at tech manufacturing level... we do not need to extract fuel and transport to run them (except batteries, which pollution is no comparison to fossil fuels)...it is readily available in earth's atmosphere...

EV's + Solar + wind and fusion power = clean energy future.. we all need to drive this....."

"PrairleDoggedRez","2018-02-25T00:12:34Z","''There is much debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period was global in extent or not. The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America, the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia. For it to be global in extent the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions.
Of course, if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today (based on an equivalent coverage over the NH and SH) then obviously the late-20th century warmth would not be unprecedented. On the other hand, if the MWP was global, but was less warm that today, then current warmth would be unprecedented.
We know from the instrumental temperature record that the two hemispheres do not always follow one another. We cannot, therefore, make the assumption that temperatures in the global average will be similar to those in the northern hemisphere.''

Phil Jones PhD CRU in response to a BBC question.

Who said CO2 was a pollutant? It's the presence of CO2 in the atmosphere that affects global temperatures, it doesn't matter if its natural or poisonous. 
""The total number of CO2 molecules above our heads in the atmosphere is more important than their percentage in the atmosphere. If the amount of inert nitrogen gas (N2) in the atmosphere were to be cut in half then the percentage of CO2 would jump (to about 600 ppm; 0.06%) without a change in the absolute amount of CO2 and no substantial change in the energy balance of the Earth. Adding a huge number of energy-absorbing CO2 molecules to the atmosphere doesn‚Äôt change its percent number very much, only because it's being added to a vast inert N2 background.""

The Natural changes in the Climate cannot be stopped by anything mankind can do, but if we all cut back a bit and used less and lived more aware of the cost and impact of modern life then it would be a step in the right direction.  For instance do people know that if you have a condensing boiler the boiler temperature should be set to between 50 - 60 deg C.  That creates the best efficiency for your heating system and saves gas.  Most people I know have their boilers set at 75 - 80 deg C and that degrades the efficiency of the boiler.

You are aware most of Africa was ""colonised"" by Europeans and that still today the main multinationals companies are financing and strategically supporting  dictatorship and pseudo democracy to keep their assets and their hegemony all over the world. 
You should also be aware that a race with China, the western world and Russia is engaged. That if politicians keep on playing big oil games our planet will turn into a gigantic junkyard with or without the Africans sooner than expected"

"Galo Aguirre","2017-08-31T01:06:21Z","The cited study was based on data from the US mainland:

 'Dr. Hanson said that global warming caused by the greenhouse effect might have been countered by some cooling phenomenon that has not yet been identified and that the readings in his study recorded the net effect.'

https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1980/06/15/ash-in-our-global-greenhouse/209c0b85-1389-41cf-88a1-560650b1b2d7/?utm_term=.e30d2f0b6708

9 years earlier this same scientist said Mt. St. Hellen's explosion would alter the data. Unless his team took this into account. 

But from the NASA website:

 It is almost 30 years later. Maybe more data was needed to declare a statistical trend?"

"Max Maxwell","2018-02-24T11:39:42Z","The oceans are part of what is referred to as the CO2 sink. Humans add vast amounts of CO2 to this sink through burning fossil fuels, deforestation, etc, whilst not removing CO2 from the sink. Therefore the sink becomes out of balance and excess CO2 collects in the atmosphere, causing warming which further exacerbates the imbalance in the CO2 sink.
There are indeed many factors that affect Earth's climate. Scientists are smart people, and they've studied their area of expertise, that's why they can account for these factors in their modelling and research and determine that the current upward trend of global temperatures is caused predominantly by... human CO2 emissions.
Can you provide a source to show that none of predictions made by climate scientists in the 70s and 80s came true, or are you simply making a baseless assertion?"

So do not say humans are a cancer that do not deserve the Earth, but the problem is how we are living the modern life.

Human society is living with the highest standards in history, but the modern life comes with costs. Consumerism with one use products such as wrappers and boxes for the products some people take granted for creates a lot of trash. The electricity we use for all our mechanical processes are mostly created by burning fossil fuels (Renewable Energy such as solar can only do so much. . .). The Cars and computer that you use to live your modern life were created by factories that emit greenhouse gases and require the mining of resources that shift the surface.

Here is the hard truth. Consumerism and the modern life is a great life, but that comes with clear costs. If you truly want to save the Earth, then understand that the human race as a whole must sacrifice many of its wants and desires and basically live with *less* in order to leave a smaller environmental impact. Until people figure out a way to somehow collect and recycle all the waste created by constant buying, spending, and throwing away of our trash, this is the only realistic option if we want to protect the planet in the long run."

The Earth is here for mankind not the other way round.  Yes, we should be responsible for it and care for it as we are starting to realise now, but all this doom laden hysteria is over the top.  8+ billion people must be having some effect, but there are larger natural effects that we can do nothing about.  But that does not stop us doing what we can, in reason.  We cannot reverse the modern world and go back to what life was like centuries ago.  The productivity of the Earth would not feed and sustain all the people who are around now.  It is the modern world and its technology that allows this.  Some of the ideas that the Eco- maniacs propose would condemn hundreds of millions of poor people in other countries to death.

""The last 3 years being all-time records on top of a century of steady increases"" You could have said the same thing in 1937.
No, 1998 was not ""cherry picked."" The length of the pause was calculated by going from the present backward until there was a positive trend. Before the most recent El Nino, that period was 18 years - not predicted by the models. Until Karl ""fixed"" the surface temperature history, the pause was also reflected in the Hadley and GISS datasets (which use the same weather station data). The IPCC acknowledged this.

The ""the heat went into the deep ocean"" is not plausible. The greenhouse effect operates through infrared back radiation, which will be absorbed in the first few millimeters of the ocean surface, so cannot heat the deep ocean. Greenhouse warming warms the atmosphere and then the surface. That didn't happen.

Did you not read what I said? ALL the century-long tide gauges show the same thing. You're citing the same ""sea level rise doubled in 1993"" nonsense that has been debunked, even by the authors of that study. The supposed ""acceleration"" (Church & White) was a comparison between the historic rate (to the present) of _coastal_ sea level rise from tide gauges at 1.7mm/yr, and the satellite altimeter (launched in 1993) measured _global_  rate of SLR at 3mm/yr. They measure two different things, not that the rate magically doubled when satellites were launched. Church and White have since walked that back, but the alarmists won't let it go. Tide gauges are both more accurate and show century-long trends, which satellites cannot do. Look for yourself:

"alcom","2017-08-28T22:13:13Z","The last 3 years being all-time records on top of a century of steady increases only reinforces the predicted pattern. The satellite record does not show there was ""no warming for 18 years"", it shows a record-breaking high in 1998 and steady moderate increases thereafter. If you remove the 1998 high as an anomaly, the whole ""pause"" is erased. Shame on you for repeating this denier garbage, you can't just cherry pick one favorite record high and ignore the rest of the trend.

The Hadley dataset is only made from surface-temperature readings. 95% of the sun's energy goes into the ocean, and the positive feedback from the blue Arctic as summer sea ice extent diminishes shows that the Arctic region is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet. Yet again you again attempt to obscure the bigger picture by presenting cherry-picked stats.

Tide gauge measurements are not as accurate as satellite readings. In addition, sea level rise is not uniform around the world. Again you cherry pick just 3 tiny anomalies to support your false narrative.

The focus on ""hottest year ever"" speaks volumes. They _should_ be saying that temperatures are rising as predicted, but instead focus on tiny warming as if that was all that was predicted. Was 1937 the warmest year on record at the time? Was 1947? 1917? This is how gradual warming works: every year is, on average, the warmest on record. Means nothing other than that the climate is warming, as it has for centuries. There is no evidence of an _unprecedented_ rate, in fact the satellite record showed 18 years of no warming at all.

If the warming had ""the fingerprints of greenhouse gases all over it,"" then the warming would have only begun in the latter half of the 20th century when atmospheric CO2 increased. It didn't. To quote Phil Jones in a 2010 BBC interview, ""This recent warming trend was no different from others we have measured. The world warmed at the same rate in 1860-1880, 1919-1940, and 1975-1998."" https://archive.fo/mlnuG/ed2f063ff371ff1dbf993c07d393dded8bb7fce2.jpg

Sea level rise remains unchanged:

These are just of few of the 60+ century-long tide gauges that show no increase due to CO2."
"alcom","2017-08-28T20:24:21Z","Yes, the climate always changes but you are oversimplifying the significance of the recent warming trend. The rate is unprecedented, the last 3 years have seen record highs in global average temperature and the overall upward trend since 1880 has the fingerprints of greenhouse gases all over it. CO2 has been steady since the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago and is the primary greenhouse gas, even though methane is technically more potent.

""""It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.""

Sea level will probably rise 3 feet by 2100 (best case scenario), after it level rose by only 6cm during the 19th century and 19cm in the 20th century. You are grasping at straws and spreading a lot of fake talking points.

You're talking about climate changing. That's not the issue. Climate has been warming for centuries - since the Little Ice Age.  In 1801 Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""A change in our climate however is taking place very sensibly."" Sea level has been rising at the same rate since before the Lincoln administration. Glaciers have been receding for centuries. Greenland once was farmed. The Fertile Crescent was once fertile. 

Only science deniers claim that climate change is a new phenomenon. The _anthropogenic_ climate change predictions said that the warming and sea level rise should have increased above the natural warming. Didn't happen."

Safe, minimal waste and short half-life for waste with the added benefit of being  proliferation  resistance for WMD's. Most people only see the standard pressurized water reactors using highly enriched uranium as the fissionable material, but thorium is a much safer technology and the fuel is more readily available. While I like other technologies better, having worked with nuclear reactors, I know most of the issues people have are from lacking knowledge about them.

The real threat comes from the consumption of animal products. The destruction of the rainforest to grow soy to feed to livestock, the trasportation of the feed and animals, and the waste is the biggest threat by far, exceeding all other contributers to global warming. Then there are the people who complain about government handouts like food stamps, but they buy milk that is 73% subsidised and meat where the feed and industry are subsidised and mooch off from everyone else while increasing health care costs."

"Akajimbo","2018-06-19T08:00:00Z","First of all, climate change does not lead to more catastrophic weathers. Historically, the total amount of wildfires worldwide have decreased by 15% since 1950. And the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America said that ‚ÄúEstimates show that even with global warming, The level of wildfires will continue to decline until mid century.‚Äù (Bjorn Lomborg, The Wall Street Journal) Also the claim that droughts have increased from global warming, is also wrong. Yes, there are places in the world where droughts became more extreme, but there are also places where droughts have become weaker. A quote from the U.N. Climate Panel 2012: ‚ÄúSome regions of the world have experienced more intense and longer drought, in particular in Southern Europe and West Africa, but in some regions, droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example in central North America and Northwestern Australia.‚Äù Furthermore, a study published by Nature in March 2014 found that globally, droughts severity has not changed thru the years. Finally, a bar graph sourced by NOAA shows that although there has been a slight increase in major Atlantic hurricanes making landfall hitting in the US, the total number of hurricanes hitting Atlantic hurricanes making landfall hitting in the US have dropped a little less than 25% of what it was in the 1950s. The sea levels are rising, but the rise is not accelerating. A paper from Global and Planetary Change found that the rate of rise has slowed down: ‚ÄúIt is found that the GMSL rises with the rate of 3.2 ¬± 0.4 mm/yr during 1993‚Äì2003 and started decelerating since 2004 to a rate of 1.8 ¬± 0.9 mm/yr in 2012.‚Äù This shows that even with CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are accelerating, the sea levels from the oceans are not. We told that the effects of climate change is catastrophic, but that‚Äôs simply not true! We are told by people like Bill Nye that if we don't stop spewing carbon, the polar ice caps are going to completely melt and destroy numerous major cities would be flooded, but we not that this process is going to take 5000 years. ""There are more than five million cubic miles of ice on Earth, and some scientists say it would take more than 5,000 years to melt it all."" National Geographic. Policies are being pushed like the end of the world is coming in 100 years. All this shows that we shouldn't be freaking out because it‚Äôs simply not necessary."
