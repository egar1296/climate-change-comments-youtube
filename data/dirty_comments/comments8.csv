"WarmWoolSox Good","2023-01-19T08:37:32Z","Fresh air blowing here! The man just speaks. Says what‚Äôs on his mind. The audience didn‚Äôt collapse in shrieking tears. 
He‚Äôs correct, of course.  It‚Äôs the biggest $$$$$$$$ scam ever played. That‚Äôs how dumbed they consider us to be. Seriously weird weather issues? CO2 is 2% of our atmosphere. ALL LIFE ON EARTH, our only lovely planet, REQUIRES CO2, including ourselves, to life. Cherry picked graphs snd charts are a con job. Look at longer term charts to see that and they‚Äôre online too. You‚Äôll see it‚Äôs truth. We could use more. Talk about a green planet. And‚Ä¶ honestly??
We exist right now in a 
Carbon Deficit. Yes. Deficit. We could use MORE, and REAL and HONEST Weather Scientists will tell you that.
Your government also has an interest in this theme, the USAF says by 2030 they‚Äôll have nanobots in all of us and in our atmosphere. Working away. Do you look up much? Just look up. You‚Äôll see some extraordinary sights today. Government (military) has pages snd pages in Weather Modification. Look for one titled ‚ÄúOperational Defense Through Weather Control in 2030 -  by the US Air Force Air Command.  
Read. Learn. Books, not an @Nooz TV show. You‚Äôll find much info about who and \WHY our weather has been for years and years now manipulated, and how nanobots, not joking, are used to move systems, create systems, hold them in place, destroy them, or themselves, after the work‚Äôs done. Self created/self destroyed and wreaking havoc. Flight apps are used too to see how NEXRAD sites cause many various storms, and yep, wildfires. Documents written by gov itself. 
It‚Äôs a very dire predicament to be in.  Please just read that one. Check out MikezDexker channel on YouTube. 
Be well. We must stay healthy as we ain‚Äôt know on each day exact what it is they‚Äôre applying, so y ah. Stay safe as you can.

He talks all about leadership and believes he has authority on all things because he has had financial success. Money does not make you an expert on anything beyond money. The only other thing money can bring you is power and influence. This is how people like this man has a platform.

 If you're skeptical of Human-caused Climate Change, I encourage you to at least look at NASA's webpage on Climate Change and from there study the scholarly journals. 

Please stop listening to talking heads on the News and actually look at the overall supported data. You can't just look at the few percent of scientists who have alternate perceptions than the 95+ percent. That's not how research works. You can't cherry pick with this stuff. I'm sorry if the political side you are not on has some plan to address what the data shows. Just because the political party you're apart of acts like the science isn't there for the sake of their agendas and wallets doesn't mean that you have to support it if the science says otherwise. The other side has agendas and isn't without sin either but that's besides the point. 

Human-enduced Climate Change should not be a politically divisive issue. The science is there and the data is becoming increasingly clear as each year passes.

Banks are an even bigger scam than global warming. What did the banks do during last recession? They wrote it all off and printed more money to land to people. Just because a bank lands someone a 30-40 year loan does not mean catastrophe is not expected. Also it is better to have riches in heaven with God where it can not be taken away than to be rich in the world. Jesus said it like this.

The reason they sell those lots is that at the end of the day it's about the all-mighty dollar. He's a well-spoken man and he was right to bring up the cyclic nature of climatic patterns, but from an ecological education, I can tell that he is viewing the conversation from his communities own theme of thought. He's looking at it from a strictly monetary perspective, not a biocentric point of view. CASE & POINT: He referenced that we have been on this earth for 13.8 billion years.

We've had several ice-ages that are known to have occurred in the history of earth's evolution. How did all these ice-ages come and go? What made the ice melt and retreat? You can't blame it on industry because there was no industry in these periods. 

There are far more powerful forces at work is determining climate variability, chiefly the sun (the power source), the oceans (which comprise 70% of the earth's surface), and many thousands of other factors - all playing a part in determining climate variability.

Human beings are all irrelevance and time will bear this out."

Secondly he also demonstrates that he has no clue about the global warming, about its causes and effects. He conveniently disregards the fact that humans caused a warming tendency in a few hundred years which naturally would take hundreds of thousands of years. He also disregards that the predictions of sea-level rise are counted in hundred years, while bank investments usually have a much smaller time frame. At the same time, it would be quite disingenuous to say that he is privy to all banking investments, and their strategic purposes. He speaks exactly the way you`d expect from a sociopath lobbyist. Obviously it wasn`t his intellect that earned him his money. As last word, it`s not the suit and the tie which makes a gentleman, but how he conducts himself."

Most of the people that want to save the environment are killing whales and dolphins, I am not talking about activists who are just deluded individuals, I am talking about Lord Rothschild, his son, who is a major in philosophy. Why are you studying philosophy when knowledge needs no focus and why do you present existence as something that is attained?

Love it! How he starts out as if he had some superior knowledge because he spent a lot of money to travel to Antarctica, and now he ""knows"" that it's on a mountain top. My, oh, my.


Maybe basic knowledge of geography would have been more helpful when it comes to understanding the difference between Antarctica and the South Pole and maybe basic knowledge of physics would have been more helpful when it comes to understanding climate change. Traveling to Antarctica clearly didn't help him with either.
He thinks the lack of disclaimers is proof that climate change doesn't exist? What? When did anyone ever give disclaimers when they were not legally obligated to do so? Why would banks care if the properties they financed are underwater at some point in the future? They'll have made a lot of money from the loan already, plus still keep all remaining claims against the debtor ready to execute and seize other funds. Maybe ask insurance companies if they will insure your beach house in Miami against flooding. Now, that's a different story. Interestingly, they do believe that sea levels are rising and will continue to rise. In fact, Miami already experiences regular flooding. So, no. Nobody's particularly interested in providing insurance for that unless they charge enough that it may still be worth it."

No one is suggesting that the climate on this planet isn't cyclical, and saying that the planet was warmer 50k  years ago doesn't in any way discredit the current models of climate change, in fact It supports them. The crux of the climate change issue isn't that things are getting way too warm right now, its that we are currently in a natural warming phase of the planet and our emissions may be (most likely are) contributing to the projected peak temperature of the period, as well as the rate at which the temperature is climbing. Dan Pena tells this same story on his Joe Rogan podcast and in much greater detail and when you listen to it, anyone with even a basic understanding of the concepts of climate change, Like I have outlined here, would understand that the scientists were making fun of Dan Pena and he just didn't understand."

There are maybe some alternatives but understand there is no such thing as a carbon free economy with human beings never has been never will be. Don't forget we're the species that discovered fire."
"Alex Wright","2020-02-27T19:55:02Z","@Kent Christiansen  Nuclear energy works on fundamentally the same principal as  as any of the fossil fuel power plants, create heat, boil water, pressurized steam spins a turbine. Hydro-electric dams work by using falling water to spin a turbine, Wind power uses wind to spin a turbine. It's all just using a given energy source to spin wires through a magnetic field. Solar is the odd one out which (don't quote me on this, I'm not an expert on how solar works) excite the electrons surrounding atoms causing them to break off from the nucleus, thus creating charge. What do all of these power sources have in common (including fossil fuel)? They all ultimately create electric charge. We have the technology, we just need to implement it. We don't need to find a cow, we already have one, we just need to bother to go and get it otherwise this ""goat"" will kill us. Don't believe me? There have already been deaths caused by the results of global warming (technically it's more correct to say climate change but that's not the point), it's primarily affecting 3rd world countries but it's just a matter of time before it affects 1st world countries. It may not be in my life time or your life time but if we don't do anything, it will wipe out all of humanity (the good news is that life on earth will survive either way, it'd take a lot more than even the most severe climate damage that we could do to wipe out life on earth.)"
"Kent Christiansen","2020-02-27T13:05:16Z","@Alex Wright  yes,yes,yes the point I'm trying to get across is this, we can not expect or hope to improve our situation by radically killing the economic matrix that supports all of us. New and sustainable energy sources must be developed to replace what we are currently using. Remember whale oil then kerosene was in use as lighting and cooking fuel for many years before the emergence of electricity and all of it's potential, however I do agree that the greenhouse gasses that we have produced is partly but not solely to blame . Without a viable replacement we are stuck with dead dino squeeze. until we find somthing better. Wind, solar, nuclear  are all useful but they do not replace what currently we use.  Radicalism produces poverty, war and unrest. There is however hope but it will require the cooperation of the energy producers to implement the technology. We should take a long hard look at quantum energy as one possible solution. By all accounts it's cheap does not pollute and it's limitless. 
But again if you kill the goat before you can find or buy a cow, you'll starve."

Also, since houses are an investment, if the risk was actually as high as some climate change nay-sayers say it is (the 10-100 feet), there would be a massive case against them with 10-30 separate charges to sue them for all the money for (e.g. false advertising).

"Chris Hollier","2019-12-22T06:37:54Z","Just a few corrections.

1.) We've been on this planet ~4.5 billion years, the 13-15 figure he was likely referencing was the best guess age of the Universe, at least in its current state of expansion post Big Bang.
2.) Most guesses I see place sea level rises between 10-30 inches by 2100, so about 20 inches in 80 years.
3.) I don't know about South America and England, but most of the south wouldn't be gone if the waters rose 10 feet.  I live south of Baton Rouge and my property is 18 feet above sea level.  Sure, it'd make it uncomfortably close, but few parts of the south would be ""gone"".  Condos for sure, but that's assuming a 10 foot rise.  Again estimates place it at around 20 inches in 80 years.

I don't buy man made global warming for the record.  It's just good to be accurate about your critiques otherwise you give big tech excuses to put wiki articles beneath your video."

"WOT Arty Noobs","2019-12-19T03:52:21Z","Climate is cyclical. The Milankovitch cycles have a lot of influence on the Climate. Some suggest that the cycles induce the Ice Ages when the amount of energy reaching the poles diminishes to such an extent, that the winter ice does not thaw in the summer and builds on top of the previous year's deposits. This then causes a feedback whereby more sunlight is reflected to space, increasing the build up of Ice.

Feedback systems do exist on this planet. There is a feedback from CO2, but what the Climate Alarmists forget (but the real scientists such as William Happer and Richard Lindzen would tell them) that water is the far more important greenhouse gas, sharing many of the same absorption spectra as CO2 and that water cool's the atmosphere by producing clouds that also reflect sunlight, thereby cooling the planet again.

There are feedback systems within feedback systems and most of the Climate Alarmists are fixated on CO2 and forget that Water vapor is by far the more important greenhouse gas and there is NOTHING that they can do to prevent water entering the atmosphere.

As for the tides, this is one of the bigger misconceptions that the Climate Alarmists make. They believe that added heat will melt the ice and that the sea level will rise ever higher, flooding low lying land. Again this is untrue. The majority of the Ice melt occurred over the past 10,000 years of the Holocene. The sea level is barely rising at all.

One of the more obvious deceptions by the IPCC, NASA and NOAA is that the tide is rising faster. It isn't. The IPCC predicted that it will be 600mm higher by the year 2100 (6mm per year). NASA on the other hand says it is rising by 3.3mm per year and used (fiddled/adjusted) Satellite data to try and prove this. The actual tidal measurements, made by observing the actual rise shows that it is going up between 1.1mm and 1.2mm per year. 

That's a big discrepancy between the wild predictions of the IPCC and the actual measured result and shows that even NASA has traded their reputation for integrity to claim funding from the green lobby. Indeed Democratic Governments deliberately de-funded anyone who did not agree with Climate Change Alarmism. So naturally NASA joined their group to keep the funding coming in.

In the first IPCC reports, they claimed that there would be hundreds of millions of refugees from Climate Change due to rising sea water. In fact - the opposite has been seen 30 years on. The nations that the IPCC named as being most at risk have increased their populations massively and are using fossil fuels to develop their land and even prevent any flooding. 

The sea level will keep rising, but it will be very slow and we can adapt to it. One of the biggest tells of the deception over Sea-Level rises is that both Obama and Al Gore have bought multi-million dollar homes by beaches. If they were so worried about sea-level rises - why would they buy mansions by the sea?!"

phenomenon - the problem we as humans are contributing to is overpopulation! In
our science classes back in the 1960s, we were taught that the carbon monoxide
given off by industries and humans is absorbed into the natural bushland
environment and converted back into oxygen. With the population growing at an
alarming rate, this means we are clearing more forests, jungles etc to
accommodate cities, villagers, shopping centres, recreation areas, stadiums,
schools etc. So what does that tell you? We are cutting down the main sources
of carbon absorption and the main areas of oxygen replenishment. We are pushing
climate change along as a species that in the end will destoy itself by
overpopulation. There will not be enough water or food to feed the population
as nothing will grow without oxygen, the seas will become acidic, so no fish.
No precipitation so no water and if there is it will be acidic. The world will
be a dust bowl. This is the issue we should be talking about, not this stupid
moronic girl who, as someone said, should get the school skipping award."

What we're arguing is that it's not driven by man- that it's a natural cycle and that our contribution is very small and of little relevance in the grand scheme of things. Also if you study the vostok ice records they clearly show that C02 lags behind temperature by 200 years meaning that C02 doesn't drive temperature, temperatures changes first and C02 follows. This is because over half the worlds C02 is stored in the ocean and when temperatures increase due to solar activity the sun heats up the oceans causing a thermal expansion of the ocean which causes the ocean to release excess C02 back in to the atmosphere. This means that we're not effecting temperature with our small contributions of C02. In fact C02 only makes up 1% of the greenhouse effect, water vapour has a lot more influence on the greenhouse effect than C02 does."
"Robert C. Christian","2019-12-13T04:43:38Z","@Tayo said _""United states has been recorded to be the lowest producer of emission""_

Google
List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions

USA is #2 right after China.  Yes I am the one who is falling for things.  The difference between you and I is, I am open to data and actually looking at the data.  I don't see how people like you can say with confidence what you're saying, when there is direct evidence you are wrong.  People like you amaze me... and you will sit there and ignore what I'm saying, you won't bother to look it up.. and you will keep repeating the lies... I just don't get why you'd do that... lol

While I don't believe the alarmists who are saying the world is ending, and we have 12 years left... I am only interested in the data.  And the data is clear.  Humans are causing a massive effect in c02 emissions.  The carbon cycle is well known, but we actually don't know the effects of releasing so much c02 in the atmosphere and what it will do or how long it will take.  The Vostok ice cores (which I assume you didn't bother to look up either) clearly show an alarming trend that everyone on earth should be looking at.  I am not telling you to be an alarmist or believe anything that the climate change alarmists are saying, I'm only telling you to look at the data.  And I'm not going to sit here, while you lie about things, without calling you out on your bullshit."

"Robert C. Christian","2019-12-12T17:19:39Z","@Semblance Of Disorder There is no doubt what the cause of it is... there are natural trends that science can see, if you examine the data.  Above these trends you can see the human effect right at the time of the 1800s when we moved in to the technological age and started to consume fossil fuels.  There is no doubt that humans are making an effect and the cause of this massive spike in the last 200 years.  We cannot stop the natural cycles of the warming trend we are in... but we can stop our own emissions which is pushing c02 emissions literally off the chart.

I challenge you.  Highlight this text below and right click and choose: Search for this on google, or just copy and search for this.

From the eMail Bag: A Deep Dive Into Polar Ice Cores

Check the second chart from skeptical science.  We have not seen an increase in c02 levels at this rate, for far longer than 800,000 years.  Climate change is a real thing.

What we can do to help is simply reduce our own c02 emissions.  There is a temperature lag ... as temperature eventually follows c02 emissions.  So what we are doing now, will not take effect for awhile and we have no real idea of what it will do."
"Semblance Of Disorder","2019-12-12T16:49:54Z","@Robert C. Christian Maybe so. Again, I'm not arguing that there is climate change occurring. I'm arguing the cause of it as well as the plan to ""fix"" it."

Nasa:
Venus may have had a shallow liquid-water ocean and habitable surface temperatures for up to 2 billion years of its early history, according to computer modeling of the planet‚Äôs ancient climate by scientists at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York.

The findings, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, were obtained with a model similar to the type used to predict future climate change on Earth.

*Scientists long have theorized that Venus formed out of ingredients similar to Earth‚Äôs, but followed a different evolutionary path. Measurements by NASA‚Äôs Pioneer mission to Venus in the 1980s first suggested Venus originally may have had an ocean. However, Venus is closer to the sun than Earth and receives far more sunlight. As a result, the planet‚Äôs early ocean evaporated, water-vapor molecules were broken apart by ultraviolet radiation, and hydrogen escaped to space. With no water left on the surface, carbon dioxide built up in the atmosphere, leading to a so-called runaway greenhouse effect that created present conditions.*

Should this number be constant every minute, day, year, century, millenium, age(s)? Does it change depending upon other celestial phenomenon e.g. earth cycle(s), moon cycle(s), sun cycle(s), galaxy cycle(s), comet cycle(s), dark energy cycles(s), dark matter cycles(s), ""things we don't know"" cycle(s)  etc...

Look into what I.R.A.S. first found. It discovered that stars are commonly binary. This means stars orbit each other in groups.
I.R.A.S. discovered our star is in a group of five.
It also had a breakthrough in classification of stars. Gas planets are being reclassified as brown dwarf stars. 
What is causing this secondary solar wind?  The Summerians wrote about it. Nobel Constantine brought in monotheism with this too. Now two objects have been spotted traversing the sun in a retrograde polar orbit of 28days. The energy in the solar wind is getting stronger. 
All of this information can be found. I only repeat information I have verified with several sources.

Climate is indeed cyclical.  They claim polar vortex is caused by the warming of polar regions.  They have the audacity to tell you that warm air that is melting the polar ice is causing frigid air to move South.  Complete bullshit.  In the 1970s they said the polar vortex phenomenon was caused by global cooling.  They said there would be global famine and mass starvation because the cooling climate would cause crop failure.  They said the global population had to be reduced.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  It's mass hysteria driven by a political power grab agenda to control people and economies.  They want you to be poor, hungry, and sick, which is exactly what you will be when they remove cost effective energy that is required to grow and transport food and heat your home in the winter."

Total bullshit. Did tobacco companies warn you of lung cancer before they got forced to by the EU? Is there any other comparable, new type of risk that contract partners have to warn you about with your OWN idea of investment?
* ""If it were real, banks in London wouldn't give out 30-40 year loans anymore, because they would know about it""
This is stupid on two levels. First, the people working in banks think short term. If the economy collapses, they might even get bailed out. So why care about what happens in 30 years? For a guy who supposedly knows about money, this is just very ignorant.
Secondly, even if we were to assume this makes sense somehow, he's implying that climate change is a wide spread conspiracy BUT banks are all insiders. This is such a stupid conspiracy theory. All the people working in banks giving out loans know about how climate change is not a risk, but the common folk don't. How does that make sense?"

I again am no climate scientist but   it would suggest watching financing rates in low lying areas over the next 10 to fifteen years will tell you exactly what the various banks really think as significant sea level rise isn't being predicted for another couple of decades it will be a very good indicator of how accurate those predictions are. Either way their is opportunity there if you think there's no climate change then short some cdfs cause they are likely to be overpriced. As for people buying seafront property there are charts available to show where various levels of sea rise will effect if you're 60 or 70 years old I wouldn't worry much regardless if you're 25 it may be prudent to exercise more caution."

"Censored Account","2019-11-04T01:19:56Z","Based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions, modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded. Like spoiled, angry children, they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave.

A social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice, voluntary cooperation and moral integrity ‚Äî as liberals do. A political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent, drive, personal appeal and work ethic, and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population ‚Äî as liberals do. And a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over-regulates and over-taxes the nation's citizens, corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state ‚Äî as liberals do.

The roots of liberalism ‚Äî and its associated madness ‚Äî can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind. When the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims, rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives, the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious.

Basically liberalism is a willful failure to mature beyond adolescence that can have catastrophic consequences for society. With luck, the official diagnosis of this disease by a mental health professional will facilitate the search for a cure.


The cure: 

A good famine or plague would solve the problem. Liberals can only survive because our society is prosperous enough to permit them to survive. If liberals had to work for a living, they wouldn't have time to protest. If our society was reduced to the basic necessities, we wouldn't have the money to employ gender studies professors or transgender awareness facilitators.

Liberals aren't equipped to survive any kind of harsh environments. One of the few benefits of a total societal collapse would be the rapid extermination of liberals."

What's the difference between a well renoun group of science reseachers making up false data and information to lead people to think and act one way and a group of well renown religious nut jobs also making things up to get people to think and act one way?
Baaa, baaa science.

Well here's  my 5 cents...
I've got a feeling that the climate change agenda will eventually lead  to a carbon foot print tax impose on those who wishes to have a baby.  The tax would have to be paid upfront and those who can't afford to pay  the baby carbon foot print up front won't legally be allowed to  reproduce.
Future hash tag # I've been bought into existence.
I would imagine there being mortgages and loans available to help pay that tax just as long as you can paid the initial 25%.
# we just got a mortgage out on a child!!! We are going to be parents!!!
# my parents died before paying off my existence debt, so now I am in the mercy of the banks.
I would also imaging that just like unnatural fruits, humans too will  become seedless (Thank you GMOs, vaccines, tap water, unnatural foods,  pharmaceuticals). So it would be one of those things where you would  have to buy fertility. # invest-in-sperm-banks
Better start saving now.

We have to pay to live in this earth (RAT RACE). No money in this Rat  Race = bad living standards, possibly homelessness depending which part  of the world you are in (the trouble is that not even so-called spiritual people  know how to function without money). Climate Change is driven  up by peoples needs to acquire money in order to survive. That means  people producing and selling things that are both pointless and  unnecessary just to make a wage.
Whats so difficult to understand? 
The Rat Race needs to STOP. 
Paying to live in this Earth needs to STOP. 
The controlled Greta mascot won't help to resolve the root cause, she  will only divert attention to the symptoms for tighter laws and  regulations that will just take more and more freedom away from the  individual.
Summery:
Rat Race = Having to pay to Live in this Earth 
Rat Race = Climate Change
Being Happy is bad for the economy. Happy healthy people don't go out  of their way to buy temporary happiness. The system is based on  consumerism and fear. The Rat Race (paying to live on this planet) is  making the majority depressed, hence why so many are on antidepressants.  There's a lot of organize psychology that goes with this, though  however that's for another time.

But anyone that looks at the data would see that starting around the industrial revolution co2 levels have raised faster than scientists have ever recorded. Looking at historical data there has never been a period of time that it has increased this much. When you look what is causing it you see that the US, China, and other large countries pump billions of co2 into the air each year. We are the problem. We can change it. It isn‚Äôt a means of control. You republicans say you can‚Äôt less government yet support the subsidies from the federal government to help oil. That is government regulation and controlling industry. Why? So it stays cheap. Moving to renewable energy will open so many jobs and create whole new industries. Moving to electric transportation will help new companies startup and develop more technology. Obviously republicans and conservatives wouldn‚Äôt want that because new industry is bad and big Fortune 500 countries should stay at the top."

Its less noticeable the further away you are from the equator. Basically the equator receives most sunlight and radiated heat energy so the water there expands and is currently swallowing up islands like Kiribati, Maldives and Tuvalu. Cities located on Delta lands are also CURRENTLY being swallowed up like Dhaka in Bangladesh which is in the Ganges delta. Even if the city still functions, it faces huge floods and people are on the move. I guess it doesn't matter to people if it's not happening in the first world and the media don't talk about the third world so I bet Americans would have never even heard of Tuvalu or Kiribati üôÑ obviously none of these Americans know about this bc they are the most ignorant people statistically in the context of foreign affairs.

Florida also, 30 yrs ago I never once saw downtown Miami flooding, algae, and sand all over the roads near downtown. These are not ideal changes in climate. The reason we have had a robust farming industry is because the weather has until now been very predictable, with the proper 4 seasons in a cycle, crops don't like overnight temperature swings of 68 degrees. Sure earths climate is dynamic and has its cycles but that's the issue, we are losing those well-defined cycles and entering an era of rapid weather changes with extreme swings in temperature and climate. We as humans might not care, we can adapt, plant life and animals do not adapt so rapidly. Dead sea life &  dead crops are nothing to dismiss, I can guarantee anyone on earth that fumes from an internal combustion engine will not help plants grow, or rainwater to be cleaner, nor make the air better to breathe, if you don't believe me run your cars exhaust into your home and test it for yourself. The corner will document otherwise on your death certificate, now multiply that engine times a few billion, .....by the way I love the smell of exhaust, I drive a modified 7.5 V8 and it's fumes will bring tears to your eyes, not of joy. Yet I would gladly give it up if I saw our government taking this issue seriously and bringing about change,  but it isn't and it won't.

His knowledge of science is inversely proportional to his business acumen and Pena just doesn't have enough sense to realize this.  He's wrong.  End of story.  We can measure global warming directly using thermal satellite imagery.  Somehow Pena believes scientists can't be trusted to measure changes in global temperature when we live in the age of gravity wave detectors.  We can measure the climate of distant worlds but not our own.  We can see the earliest moments of the Big Bang and map our own DNA but can't measure global temperature.   Height of arrogance.  Height of foolishness.     John Stossel is similarly arrogant and misguided."

Both examples of ad hominem attacks and name calling. 
People only resort to these tactics when they know they're wrong...like yourself. Why do I need to explain that to you? You pose as an intelligent entity when you're intellect is actually pseudo.
More proof that your intellect is faux = this is the 4th time I've had to explain to you that when co2 levels rose after WW2, the earth simultaneously experienced a cooling period...if co2 increases directly resulted in warming, then the earth wouldn't have experienced a cooling period as the co2 levels rose...that's what's called a real life example, also a direct conflict in your assertion.
We don't need to look at ice samples to record the earth's temperature, we have these things called thermometers and pens and paper. We can calculate the temperatures with thermometers and then we can write them down on paper so to record what the temperature was in a given year...What don't you understand about that?
And since you seem to be obsessed with ice, it's nice to know that the Antarctic and Arctic actually have more ice sheets and ice mass now than they have in years. Al gore's aptly named boat called the Inconvinient Truth was recently stuck in an ice sheet when researching ice levels during the summer months, and even the rescue boat equipped with ice cutting machinery became stuck and helicopters had to be sent to rescue both boats. More ice than ever.
And as a personal note, my town has had record snow fall the last 4 years. More snow than ever."

In 2008 we saw how these people don't care for their customers or even the same companies they represent as long as they individually can enrich themselves by misrepresenting reality. Moreover, insurance companies are just required to have from 8 to 10 % of what they gamble so in an eventually like the subprime mortgage crisis they don't have enough money to pay their customers.

I know Megan and Harry were called out for using 4 private jets in a single week, while they were telling people the world was going to end because of climate change.

There is evidence sea level is actually dropping, but these people are ignoring it. They like to use the tiny little island nation of Kiribati as an ""example"" of global warming, when the damn island is like 2 meters above sea level and the people there have over populated the island and turned it into a rubbish dump, and now demand the UN gives them billions of dollars because of ""sea level rise"" when the island has never really been habitable and floods the minute the winds rise or they get heavy rain.

"Local_Brain_Error // Synaptic_Misfire_Detected","2019-11-28T09:09:16Z","Steve Minor Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.  The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.

Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.

The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.  Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.

Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth‚Äôs climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming."

Children in high schools were scared shitless by doomsday documentaries and encouraged to join the Nuclear disarmament movement. But when the Soviet Union collapsed that got put on the back burner.
Coincidentally around this time Climate change started to emerge in mainstream media. I was listening to some young activists testifying to US congress about climate change and they were talking about colonialism and slavery. So I have no doubt about who is behind the climate change movement. Young minds are the easiest to work on. Science has become highly politicised. When you cannot question the science it is not anymore science but religion."

Before publication is even considered, they are thoroughly challenged and scrutinized by other experts within the same field to determine legitimacy. Obviously why professors in Universities generally won't even permit the use of other sources. Credibility is imperative to support any argument when analyzing a given subject. But if you intend to suggest the vast majority of the science is funded by fraudulent political powers to mislead the public, you may consider who's funding the underwhelming percentage of research denying human imposed climate change. I believe therein you'll discover the simple truth of the matter and why that argument is utterly nullified."

"Eric Carmichael","2019-09-17T03:30:15Z","Global warming is satan's way of trying to discredit God. After the flood in the days of Noah. God put a bow (rainbow) in the sky to represent his promise to never destroy earth with water. This same rainbow still appears to remind us of that promise. So if satan can some how discredit that and install fear to expand his own kingdom on earth he will. Same goes for the pride flag that they use. Satan dosent want anyone to believe or remember what God has shown us and promised us. Pretty messed up and sick but knowing the enemy and his strategies is a large part of the battle. Hopefully people like this women in this video wake up soon. I pray in Jesus name they wake up to satans scams. 
Satan uses the love of money to get big corporations, politicians, actors, musicians, athletes and leaders to do what he wants them to do. Money isn't the root of all evil. It's the love of money that's the root of all evil. Then he works through them, using fear and money to get to the masses. He'll never give up no matter how derailed his plans get. Satans pride allown will only cause him to try harder and to figure out a way to come back twice as strong, but he's always only given so much control. Job was a prime example of that. Job and Satan learned major lessons. Job ended up truly closer to God than ever before. However, satan learned that when it comes to one of  Gods people he'll never be allowed to harm them or win them over. That's the very moment satan learned he has to use others and destroy things around them just to mess with them or get them to slip. Jesus was born to show us what being godly truly is and to free us from our sins. Satan then had to start all that progress he made all over again. All I'm saying is know your enemy and keep your faith. Don't fall for his propaganda. If you're still reading this comment and you aren't saved through Jesus, Gods only begotten son that died on the cross and concurred the grave by raising three days later. Your closer to believing and being saved than you may realize. Something kept your interest. Just take that final breath of flesh air and become born again spirit filled and make that next breath be a breath of eternal salvation and forgiveness. If you're already saved through Jesus and are still reading please spread the word any and everywhere. That's what all believers are called to do. Hope I've inspired and most importantly God inspires you. Love y'all God Bless. Please leave comments or any type of fellowship."

Not a tv Bill Nye type and he explains that there are 33 models used for climate predictions.  All of them but one are way off the global heat index predictions. The Russian model is the only one that has correctly predicted the temps over the last 20 years and doesn't have man made warming calculations added.  All the others do and are off, not by a little, by a ton.  The main problem with 97% of our scientists is that they are still using prediction from the other models that have already proven false. 

We are about to enter a cooling period as the sun goes into a less active phase.  Over the next decade or so temps will be heading down.  Don't be surprised if these same scientist tell you were having a crisis of cooling.  They did it in 1990.   God bless All and please look at the stuff yourself.

Thousands of emails were hacked but did thousands of emails show evidence of a hoax? No.
Like Piltdown man, there are some simple explanations as to why people ""seem"" to have forgotten climategate.
Human activity has contributed significantly to recent warming. The climate statements from the world's leading scientific organisations say much the same. Such a huge hoax and little more than a handful of emails from more than 10 years ago. A conspiracy beyond your wildest imagination(literally)."

Why did they change the language from ""Global Warming"" to ""Climate Change""? It made it more palatable since every winter record cold temperatures are being recorded around the world. ""Climate Change"" is a more defendable name since climate change has been occurring since the creation of the planet and will continue to do so.

"Stan Shumer","2019-09-24T16:46:23Z","@Luke Sullivan Here's a copy and paste from another thread where I used REAL facts and supported them. 

we've been measuring the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere since the 1950's? So today scientists have actually drilled into the Arctic ice sheets to obtain samples or ice cores from many years ago containing gas bubbles which are used to measure the carbon concentration in the atmosphere from those periods. If you're familiar with the keeling curve, the evidence produced from the ice sheets actually align perfectly with the keeling curves pattern, which demonstrates an increasingly warmer climate. We have also obtained samples of sediment from the sea floor dating back to the same periods of the carbon samples extracted from the ice sheets. This sediment contains clam shells used to actually determine the temperatures from these same periods. Much like tree rings are used to indicate the age of a tree, clam shells too have layers that increase with age. Using these clam shells, they can actually measure the chemical composition, as shells incorporate oxygen from the sea water when they grow. The composition of that oxygen is determined by the temperature of the sea water, indicating the temperature during these periods. Well to put the last key data set into this puzzle to see if it correlates with the other two curves, we discover that it does! So therefore the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere is directly linked to the rising temperatures measured in the same periods that fit identically into the pattern demonstrated by the keeling curve. This is just a crash course on much of the research being done, but there's so much more. And 97% of climate scientists from all around the world have come to the same conclusions."

I again am no climate scientist but   it would suggest watching financing rates in low lying areas over the next 10 to fifteen years will tell you exactly what the various banks really think as significant sea level rise isn't being predicted for another couple of decades it will be a very good indicator of how accurate those predictions are.

"Stan Shumer","2019-10-27T15:37:18Z","@mike yaeger there is so much wrong with your comment. You talk of ice cores, yet misrepresent their data claiming they somehow prove the case against AGW. I've read the literature and the data says just the opposite. They tell us of carbon concentrations dating back to 800,000 years ago. They also align with the temperatures produced in these periods with respect of the Suns activity and role in warming at the time. I never claimed the Earth hasn't been warmer. In the Cambrian, we had a sun 6 percent weaker, yet with average temperatures 18¬∞ higher, melting all the ice at both poles, sustaining terrestrial life only along the belt of the equator. Why was it warmer? Because we had concentrations of 7,000ppm at the time, warming the Earth in spite of a weaker sun that would have otherwise cooled the Earth. It is not enough to conclude climate science with silly remarks like ""the climate is continueously changing, it always has,"" because we're aware, and that doesn't address the question as to WHY it has. And climate models have actually quite successfully reproduced temperatures dating from 1900 to present. But to your comment on the predicted ice age in the 70's, that is incorrect. A paper was published stating how we should in fact begin to cool based on orbital cycles and axial rotation resulting in a weaker sun, but the overwhelming concensus was that we were warming and would continue to do so. The ice age story was just a better headline and the media ate it up. This is now propagandas information used far too often in hopes to discredit scientific projections. Fortunately, it is easily debunked."

"janets9179","2019-10-21T00:28:33Z","@Steve Gracy ice in water floats and a small percentage sticks up above the water level, like an iceberg. If you pushed the ice cube completely under water and measured the water level then, and compared that to the water level after the ice melts, I predict the water level with the melted ice would be lower than the level with the submerged ice cube. It might not be a significant change depending on how much ice you are talking about. Water expands by 9 percent when frozen, so liquid water occupies less volume than ice."

Both terms are understood and discernable, and they are each still often used today. You're clearly out of the loop if you don't even know that. 

And texts were just one example, which can't be discredited as your authority remark would assume. The published climate science literature is where you find the studies that have led to theory.

A hurricane hits, the government comes in to relocate people and rebuild houses, paying for it with taxes. You people are arguing for us to do nothing because it means more money out of your paycheck, because apparently science is only real when it doesn't cost you money. You don't care that the gov't is stealing from you (and has been stealing from you) to provide corporate welfare to the owners of the beachfront properties when disasters happen. 
Meanwhile, we're destroying and building over all our carbon buffers (forests, grasslands), little by little and people like you are defending the people who have nothing to lose from it. and receive the biggest corporate welfare when disasters actually happen."

Even if any of it is actually true, and WE can actually do something about it, you realize the US would have to destroy it's entire economy just to make a 0.0002% difference in temperature? CHINA and AFRICA are the main areas where there is nothing being done to combat ""climate change"". 90% of the worlds plastics in the ocean comes from 8 rivers in the world, I'll give you a hint, It's not in the US!

Meanwhile, millions would die because of lack of cooling or no heat for their homes. There aren't any actual useful solutions that can combat these problems for millions and millions if not billions of people. You think people would survive long in 100 degree weather every day? Or -30 degrees in winter on a daily basis without the heating they need? Crazy talk. No one is even paying attention to what would have to be done to make even an iota of a difference in the earths temperature. 
What about the emissions needed just to make the parts for renewable energy? I'll give you a hint, it uses fossil fuels! Oh, and all the batteries and such for it? Yeah, they aren't recyclable. They aren't degradable. There is no ""safe"" way to get rid of them. 
Those electric cars you want to run? Yeah, the carbon footprint just to make them is almost twice the amount of a regular car. 
Oh, and the electricity to actually charge that car? Yeah, that comes from power plants that use fossil fuels and coal and what not. That is NEVER going to go away because there is no other surefire way to power us. Unless you want nuclear energy, which is technically the cleanest energy on earth, but for some reason we don't talk about that right liberals? LOL. 


What we do know is, there is no guarantee anything bad is even going to happen because of climate change. And certainly not because of anything the human population is doing to it."

Pe√±a's argument about investments in coastal property is flawed since he looks to the market as an accurate indicator of environmental phenomenon. MARKET FORCES AREN'T ALWAYS LOGICAL AND NEVER HAVE BEEN. Look to any goddam bubble, look to the '08 crisis! The rational approach to figuring out if human activity will cause a climate crisis is by analyzing HUMAN ACTIVITY and the CLIMATE. 

Yes climate cycles have happened due to natural carbon cycle, but when carbon sinks like coal and gas which have been accumulating for millennia are burned in a period of 150 years, THE RULES CHANGE. The concern is about the RATE of carbon emission increases. Any belief that humans have nothing to do with recent carbon spikes is completely fucking wrong, its been proven countless times over decades.

Predictions have been wrong in the past but thats because the climate is one of the most complicated dynamic systems that humans can study, hence its extremely hard to predict the temperature decades down the line, let alone the effects of that increase. However, given that the rate of carbon emissions has skyrocketed so dramatically in a time period of blink of an eye in geological timescales, it stands to reason that there will be a severe ecological imbalance that could either fuck things up a little bit, or fuck things up immensely. In any case we will run out of oil eventually, why not make the switch to low-emission energy now?"

"William William","2019-08-22T22:24:29Z","Being a successful businessman and having seen a few geologic cores does not make for a reliable source of information regarding climate change. As a Geoscientist it is clearly understood that the climate changes over time. The issue is not change but the rate of change. Too fast and the global ecosystem and human society cannot adapt accordingly. Anthropocentric influences have increased this rate of change; this is a scientific fact of high confidence. Thousands of scientists worldwide agree using logic not opinions. As the climate changes, there will be increased weather and ecosystem impacts to individual humans and the global economy and political systems. With regards to bankers and insurance, Dan's claims are false. Many banks and insurance companies are already changing their policies and preparing for climate change by investing millions in climate change risk analysis. Get an education in science, complex systems analysis, and critical thinking before you jump on the fallacious bandwagon of believing climate change is a hoax. For those who will dismiss this info because it doesn't align with their beliefs, lets imagine for a second climate change is a global conspiracy. First of all, lying about it is too difficult. There are too many intelligent people who can independently verify that it is changing. If anything a globalist agenda would want real climate change to decrease the population and make it easier to take over failing political and economic systems. By saying climate change is a hoax you are probably helping your conspirators take over the world and you are destroying the planet at the same time. The systems of this planet are vastly complicated even for the educated to understand. Don't assume you know the truth to anything unless you have investigated it yourself from an unbiased lens that looks at both sides critically."

My guess is we are going to be driving electric cars sooner than you think, coal is already dead except India and some place Trump adored. We are going to look at agriculture for the animal protein and antibiotic nightmare contributing to 30% to 70% of the problem. We need a different optimistic voice to lead the way. We can make progress and store energy with wind and solar hydroelectricity and nuclear energy. We can measure the Ph in the oceans and work on that. It‚Äôs 2019 as I write this.

Look fella, CO2 levels did used to be higher - mass volcanic activity elevated them, we had more land and marine photosynthesis and more cyclical transfer then, what we had then too was masses of vocanic ash causing global dimming, ontop of that we had decreased solar intensity and ontop of that what we had was less nitric oxide excretion from the soil. The issue is not about CO2 alone, the whole mechanism of the greenhouse effect is part of acidifaction of the oceans etc. If the top scientists all agree that global warming is happening, if the top universities are working on solutions and if fucking NASA are trying to calculate greenhouse emissions' impact on it, surely you should listen?! There has been a global trend between net atmospheric CO2 and methane (combined) and sea surface temp. The correlation is staggering and that is even with the exacerbated cooling during prior periods when co2 accumulation was resultant of volcanic activity which created global dimming via clouds preventing surface warming, even despite that, the profound nature of the greenhouse gases still had a perfect synchronicity with sea surface temperatures. We have struck the system off balance in terms of co2 capture and now with methane, nitric oxide etc in the mix resultant of the idiotic mass animal agriculture industry, the planet cannot reduce the greenhouse effect as quickly as it could before when the volcanic ash was abundant and plant life could thrive without human destruction. If you open by saying that you are a supporter of Trump and then shout at a woman for asking a question and swearing, you have shown your colours. He has assaulted the environment beyond carbon emissions and has allowed not just pollution of water but also pollution of food and land through derestrictions on industry for monetary stimulus. He is scum. Ontop of that, Trump appointed a climate change denier who is a coal industry lobbyist and lawyer to head the environmental protection agency (EPA), that in itself says it all. Dan Pena, you are a dick."

So in the long run, if global warming does happen in these properties do sink, the folks that gave out the loans would have been long dead"

You think it is going to get too hot, when really, no has heard of the Frozen Age. I heard from a spirit that follows me and told me that THAT was one of the Natural Environments Promised Ends it has for punishment. Our own imagination tells of what the apocalypse and what the end is like and just a bunch of other trash, when they have not understood one thing: we created our own Promised End. We keep fueling and raging a storm of our own. We keep attracting it day-to-day without even considering of thinking about it. When our storm we brewed comes forth, it causes the very destruction itself. After, comes the Frozen Age basically. Do not think the Arctic is gonna be dead of ice. It is colder than you think.

"mattfreedom2002","2019-06-06T18:52:54Z","This ridicule of certain ideas like this man is doing is the way that governments win over even the ""smarter, more liberal"" thinkers, as it makes them re-rationalise the topic with this new ""knowledge"" but also with a subconscious fear of being an idiot (like this man portrayed supporters of global warming) if they think what they used to think. This forces them to sway more towards the new viewpoint, as to maintain the intelligence on the topic. It's repeated over and over again whenever humans try and make some kind of positive effort, but effort that clashes against the objectives of those in power. Be it living more consciously of ones actions for the benefit of the world's ecosystems, global warming, reducing material consumption, eating a more plant-based diet (I'm not saying go vegan, but incorporating a primarily plant based diet is unarguably healthier than what most people eat), it's the same story every time: an anti-movement gets some momentum and along come those that ridicule the movement (always people unqualified to talk on the topics, like news reporters or this man Dan Pena) which causes people to pause and reevaluate, which slows and eventually stops the momentum. And on top of this adopting this new way of thinking lets us all continue with our ways, which regardless of whether or not globabl warming is real is destroying the ecosystems of our planet."

"Citizen 337","2019-06-04T16:57:16Z","Solar and galactic, and yes there has been weather upheaval, and guess what? It's going to get worse - much worse. But it isn't warming. It's an electromagnetic disruption that is causing the total system to be top-loaded with charge, and that is going to cause massive precipitation in all seasons (heavy rain, flooding, snow in the winter), there will be some overall cooling as well as heat flashes in regions, and if the frequency of rays gets low enough and concentrated enough, we'll see some serious vulcanization and earthquakes. Right now, the major band of activity is cosmic rays, which give us the precipitation and the more volatile storms and wind. The quakes and vulcanization are driven by lower energy waves - gamma rays, which typically come from an active sun. Right now, the problem is that the sun is very inactive, electromagnetically speaking. This is lowering the strength of protection from its magnetic field. Also the earth's field is lowering for some unknown reason, and there are possible galactic cycles involved, as well as factors related to long term gravity cycles within the solar system, and finally the solar system itself is moving out of a protective stellar gas cloud. Lots of factors, all of which have nothing to do with human activity. CO2 is a small, small factor in greenhouse gases anyway."

CO2 levels increase after warming periods and do NOT cause warming. The reason is that carbon dioxide (Co2) is more soluble  in cold water, and as the ocean temperatures increase then the oceans start to release the Co2 because it can not stay dissolved!

Most all social media is controlled by the Deep State that are lying about global warming. BTW every prediction the global warming crowd has made since the farce began has failed to come about. Now let me shut this shit down completely. The oceans put out up to 60 times more carbon than our dirty little civilization every year & has no effect on climate. Mt Etna burped a while back & put out 10,000 times more carbon than our entire civilization has in it's ENTIRE HISTORY! (no effect)
 It's the sun that controls the climates of all the planets in our solar system. We just entered into a Grand Solar Minimum in 2017. It has & will get colder planet wide every year until at least 2031.  There still will be summers & heat during summer but some places will barely have a summer & winters will be longer & colder. Floods & wild weather are common during  a GSM. A GSM only happens once every 200-400 years or longer. During the first part of a GSM are when the worst quakes & volcanic activity happen. So watch the entire West Coast of the USA become a disaster area, & New Madrid fault or midsection, S. Carolina, Alaska, & Puerto Rico. According to the best research there's an 82-100% chance of this happening. (read ""Upheaval"" by John Casey---the entire last half of this book are all references to other reputable scientists  that have overlapping research). It's so easy to lie to the public & get them to believe anything. Find a subject everyone is concerned about (pollution) & blame future bs events on it. Say we can change it if countries pay taxes (carbon credits-legal theft). Fukin suckers are everywhere......................................."

Banks, as we all know, never have enough cash on hand to cover the entire amount on their books. This is why a run on the bank is always such a crisis. At closing, banks must have a certain percentage of funds in cash. If for any reason they come up short, they borrow from the Fed to cover the difference. And who is the Fed? It is a private bank owned by...well, we¬†don't exactly know. There are board members, yes, but they are not the owners. Another interesting tidbit: They have never been audited. Not once. The organization that controls our interest rates and our money supply has never been audited. They also have socialist ties and guess who is trying to push the climate change, democrats, and what have them become, socialists. I can assure you that there is no need to worry about climate change. If you look at temps starting at 1926, it has actually gotten colder. And, my gosh, if they can't accurately predict the temperature two weeks in the future, how can I trust their forecast 30 years in the future? And, if you call climate, ""overall temp,"" how in the world can they get that right if they can't get temperatures right? You need temps to get climate. Any who, sorry for the rant!"

The American people and their own government have zero control over our own currency. Since its inception, no one has ever been able to audit them. And, if all us crazy deniers are right, climate change is an attempt to enact policies as a means to force socialism onto people. Once example is the climate peace accords and their so called carbon credits. Just food for thought :)"

"evolution rhythm","2019-05-26T16:35:19Z","Sure! ;-) And humans love planting tree's and looking after the natural world!.


Humans, in general,  make decisions due to the evolved cost/benefit analysis psychology and the more immediate  (though less far less accurate overall) & more emotive response behavioural psychology (i.e. instinct). Mitigating climate change and environmental degradation in general will require a significant change to the typical (a statistical average) human behaviour (including the emotively driven psychological response) of the average human (see evolutionary psychology topics regrading ""The stone age mind""). Therefore it will (is proving)  be difficult for humanity (on average) to make the necessary changes to any particular civilisation in time to prevent some of the most dire consequences of ecosystem failures (i.e. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù (an average) won‚Äôt see it coming until it‚Äôs too late to prevent the ‚Äúworst case‚Äù scenario of climate change and ecosystem dysfunction). 
Thus, in order to try & best circumnavigate severe ecosystem dysfunction (e.g. to the food web) ,human populations must understand, A.S.A.P ,themselves more accurately (on average) and what drives their behaviours. Also why these behaviours have evolved to be the way they are (e.g. Emotions that fit within the Esteem dynamics like Envy, Pride, Guilt, Hate, Love etc.). Ideally these current environmental destructive behaviours can be mitigated through a democratic & cooperative route. Alternatively, over time (worst case scenario), humanities behaviours that positively correlate with causing environmental degradation will be reduced (by severe population reduction) by the ecosystem limiting factors they have caused (cause and effect). Natural laws that all species are ultimately governed by."

We have no private banks to which we can accumulate our wealth without the United States being able to get its hands on us when we refuse to pay for endless wars through the Internal Revenue Service.

In fact they'd rather ignore the fact that all the industries engaged in those processes have a colossal (but woefully short-term) vested interest in keeping people using plastic, filling their fuel tanks, eating mass-produced low-quality food - to keep the money flooding in - but no, they'd rather create some fanciful horseshit about how (instead of endless economic growth and relentless domination of nature being an outright scam), radically adjusting our lifestyle to living peaceably and with minimal impact on the natural world is the moneymaking scam.

As a British person I hope you're enjoying the vast waves of migrants that have arrived in your country, because climate change will send you millions more.
First off his single anecdote of some dude he spoke to in the Antarctic is fucking worthless next to the decades worth of heavily researched, peer reviewed articles published by scientists.
Second, he completely lies about the sea level rise estimates. WORST CASE SENARIO estimates are around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet for you American tards out there) of rise by the end of the century. That leaves plenty of locations in low lying places, like Florida, for homes to escape scott free. And besides, notice how I said ""by the end of the CENTURY""? Mortgage and housing companies don't plan on those long of timelines you fucking pillocks.
Third. Al Gore is a fucking tard alarmist and is neither a scientist nor representative of the climate science community. Stop trotting his strawman-ass out and act as if a rubuttle of his retardation is a refutation of decades of research.
Fourth and last of all. I WISH the worst we had to fear from climate change is sea level rise, because we can engineer around it (sea walls, levees, what have you). But the greatest danger it poses to us is ecosystem loss. We are looking a the tens of millions of people who depend on fish for their diet going hungry.

Thirdly, he just proves himself a stupid of a special kind that thinks that just because the world was warmer by 2 degrees 75000 years ago, it's OK this time too. Foolish guy doesn't want to consider that if that really happened, humans weren't the cause of it, nor was human existence this complex and therefore so fragile that when we take into account the tremendous rise in mankind's ability to destroy not just the planet, but himself too, it becomes a no-brainer to err on the side of caution.

2: when warming happend in the past it was way slower then right now. Slow enough for species to adapt. Right now millions of species go extinct in an alarming rate (6th mass extinction rate).
When it was to fast (because of meteor strike etc.) huge mass extinctions happend like it is now.

Alot of tropical mountains got more unstable climate which gave harmfull fungi (chytrid) an adventage and killed almost 100 species of frogs.

This is all because of us.
We're the cause of the 6th mass exinction through deforistation and climate change.
To deny this is like saying an 10x10x10cm box has unlimited space. The earth is limited and we're breaking it.

Read a book: Climate Change Biology if you want 1000s of scientific backup up evidence and examples."

There's a natural cycling of temperature. Sometimes it's globally warmer, sometimes it's cooler. The difference now is that the global temperature is rising 10-100 times quickly than it ever has in the past. Also, right now the earth should actually be cooling instead of warming up, when considering natural influences on global temperature.

Your argument is akin to telling a fire investigator that fires have always happened naturally in the past. That would doubtless earn you a puzzled look from the investigator. Is the implication that because they have occurred naturally in the past, humans can‚Äôt cause fires?"

"Rocknrolladube","2019-05-20T00:58:29Z","Global warming is definitely overblown...especially the proposed solutions (which are all scams or badly misdirected)...but, Dan's reasoning is very flawed.  All banks are notorious for making loans that threaten their own future solvency and future ROE.  All the biggest banks have implicit guarantees from their sponsor governments (and in some cases governments from other countries).  All their CEOs, other chiefs and directors are also insulated, because they are compensated for short-term goals and are often long gone when the rotten fruits of their labour manifest.  And even when they are around to see their house of cards crumble, it is actually quite normal for them to receive a golden parachute.  So Dan is a fucking wrong on this one...but he is 100% that the business of global warming is a scam...

Let's assume that man-made global warming is real...might as well be safer rather than sorry.  So, if real, we need to choose from the 2 possible ways we have to attempt to solve the issue.  1) change your behaviour to be as green as possible...that means asking yourself, are you willing to give up things you love like most of our technology, meat, materialistic stuff, etc...and I'm talking about YOU, not all the people around you...YOU...are you ready to give up these things all by yourself and be a hero or an example for others?  2) Perhaps you think this problem is so important that we actually need to make a new set of rules for other people?  It isn't enough for just you to stop, and it is so important that you want to infringe on other people's freedom to stop the problem...okay, if you are willing to force others to make changes, THEN YOU ARE BARKING UP THE WRONG FUCKING TREE!  Go to China and India and make the stop what they are doing.  Vote for politicians here who have the goal of launching economic warfare to cripple China's and India's economy.  If you are okay being a dictator to save the world, then focus your efforts where it matters...Or shut the hell up and be a hero and change your own behaviour.  Those are your choices if you were are being honest...either you change, or focus on changing the behaviour of people in China & India and once you got them all using solar panels and wind power you can come and bother people in the West...prioritize or admit you are a pseudo-hero beta soy-boy!"

"Padraic Burns","2019-09-16T17:16:19Z","@Lohengramm I'll now respond to your greenhouse effect comment. Most of the predicted warming actually comes from water vapor, where the greenhouse effects' warming increases evaporation of the oceans and the vapor is the driving factor for further warming. The problem is while CO2's effect on the atmosphere has been well studied for decades the same cannot be said for the feedback effects like water vapor. Increased evaporation would also lead to increased cloud formation which would reflect sunlight out into space.

In any case, cold is the bigger killer than warmth. Many species would thrive in a warmer climate. Changes in global temperature disproportionately effect polar regions, so a warming climate would do more to make Canada and Siberia temperate than it would to make equatorial regions too hot."
"Padraic Burns","2019-09-16T17:00:53Z","@Lohengramm I'll repeat myself: CO2 levels were five times higher during the Jurassic than they are today, even with human emissions. Without human activity digging up and burning fossil fuels that carbon would remain trapped underground where it's not available for use by plants.

Natural processes move carbon underground (over the course of millions of years), and over enough time that could cause atmospheric CO2 levels to drop below the point necessary to sustain plant life. During the last ice age that almost happened when they dipped to around 180 ppm. After millions of years of carbon being depleted from the atmosphere there's no reason to assume preindustrial levels of CO2 are ideal. Climate change could be a change for the better, and you're a long way off from proving your doomsday theory.

According to ASHRAE and OSHA 1000 ppm is safe, compared to 350-450 ppm as the normal outdoor level. Adverse health effects don't set in until 2500-5000 ppm and a maximum allowed concentration within an 8 hour work period is 5000-10000 ppm."
"Lohengramm","2019-09-16T16:12:45Z","@Padraic Burns 
Yes this is the best thing that can happen to plants as far as I know. 
But its not that great for the rest of the planet. 

Tldr; The Carbon in our atmosphere is reflecting the sunrays back to earth warming up the planet. More Carbon (or any other greenhouse gas) in our atmosphere = more sun energy stays in the planet heating up the planet even more

Its called the greenhouse effect

And its pretty easy to see what effects a warmer planet can have for us."

This is true that the carbon underground gets back into the atmosphere naturally in something called the Carbon Cicle

However we dig up so much so fast that the planet cant keep up with our Carbon emission and alot of what we produce just stays in the atmosphere because it cant ""get back into the earth""
You dont have to look really hard to see the density of Carbon in the Atmosphere has increased exponentialy since the industrial revolution"

Nonetheless I do believe that it's the banks responsibility to know where they invest the money and it shouldn't be blamed on governments regulation. Yes the Feds and Bush could have prevented it if they looked beyond the numbers of strong employment, low inflation and increasing consumer spending, and realized that housing prices can't rise for all eternity, but the blame doesn't only fall on them.

Isn't it a fact that the banks shouldn't have been dabbling into the CDO market when they didn't understand it? It's also a fact that they could have detected how much bad debt their subprime mortgages included, but they were in the business of making money therefore ignoring the problems with it. This short term profit and thinking clearly didn't work out well in the long term for many banks."
"Moonie","2019-09-17T12:20:58Z","@James Chapman Yes, I've read a lot about the financial crisis. Yes, I blame the banks for ignoring credit-worthiness of borrowers, ignoring unregulated loans, allowing interest-only loans where homeowners can't afford rising mortgage rates, how they repackaged mortgages so it became unclear how high risk of default there was, selling these to other banks, international banks, hedge funds, pension funds and private investors etc.

Are you saying that we shouldn't blame the banks for their lack of interest in how short term thinking to create profits caused this?¬†

I find it very relevant if you want to make a decision not based of science simply because banks (who have been wrong in the past) invest their money into condominiums.¬†
If anything you can actually turn this over and say that they'll make a good profit on creating these ¬† condominiums and in the future if problems arises because of climate changes (not saying just rising sea levels, but also extreme weather) they'll be able to make even more money if they are involved with insurance companies. Either way I don't see how his statement makes any sense. Why wouldn't banks have any incentives to create these properties even if their will be problems in the future? They make money now and won't take the loss in the future so why would they care about rising sea levels? If anything there'll probably be money to earn in building ""sea banks"" by companies (not sure of the English word, since English isn't my native language, but I'm trying to describe the walls you make that protect the land close to the shore).

That's why I find his statements dumb, how can he rely on what investments the banks make to say that climate change isn't real when it doesn't make a valid point?

P.S. Considering what page I'm on I should probably point out that yes I know extreme weather aren't always caused by climate change and that it's not always able to determine how much impact climate change have since it'a complex with many variables in some events."
"Moonie","2019-09-17T12:20:09Z","@gerald frost Thanks for agreeing to some of the things I wrote, and I'm agreeing with some of yours too I must say.

Yes a warmer temperature can obviously create new opportunities like f.ex. in Russia. We can already see changes like this in f.ex. Southern Sweden there's vineyards and in South Korea some farmers have transitioned into growing tropical crops like banana, coffee etc. I'd say that there is no ideal temperature for the planet Earth, but for species there are. In Australia f.ex. they have a problem with bats dying like flys because extreme heat boils their brains. So I'd say we'll probably see some species of animals and plants go extinct unless they adapt by moving.¬†

The problem is that everything on Earth is accustomed too the current temperature and a lot of areas will become unlivable when it changes. I truly believe that we'll have conflicts and wars in the future derived from starvation and severe water shortages. I'm already against the amount of refugees that have entered the west, so I barely want to imagine what will happen when all these areas that have the most people on earth becomes unlivable and they'll need to move towards other countries or die.

I believe that the biggest problem in the future will be the lack of water, the second will be lack of food, and the third will probably be natural disasters.¬†

I'm aware that it's the ground water, but I don't think it will ever be replaced. When they start realizing that they run out of water they can't afford to save anymore and won't be able to refill it... There just doesn't seem to be any thoughts about using excessive amounts of water to produce f.ex. clothes before it runs out and then during a shortage it's to late to make it up again."

The global crisis, and that's what it is, has not been on the radar of big business for as long as they've been large enough to have an effect on this planet. ie 20th century increases in people, manufacturing, gasses, products, pollution etc. They have done it because it hasn't been a discussion until now.

If it were true, then companies WOULD be held accountable for the products they make....ALL plastic would be 100% recyclable and there would be less of it. Since as consumers, we ONLY purchase what is available....it's ludicrous to think this topic starts with individual homes!

You could have anyone you want, tell me it's a real issue but actions speak louder than words....so therefore I choose to believe it's a scam.

""Climate Greta"" is ONLY regurgitating what is already out in the public arena......NOTHING NEW. She says it's a generational thing....because that's what she has been told....she does not have a full understanding/ comprehension of the topic and how it boils down to industries making poor choices, whilst maximising profits!

I feel she has been put as a poster child for big business to scare/ guilt trip people into handing over their cash to help clean up the world.....bit like cancer research asking for your cash but never actually coming up with affordable treatment.....even though it's our cash that helped to fund the  research in the first place!!!"

The burning of fossil fuels and chemical-intensive industrial agriculture are the main drivers of climate change. The good news is that humans have the power to stop, and potentially reverse, climate change, but the solution is not fancy new carbon-capturing technology (biochar is the way to go as far as sequestration goes / it would also reduce the use of artificial fertilizer production and nitrous oxide emissions). A significant part of the solution to climate change is to harness the power of Mother Nature in the form of organic regenerative agriculture and the restoration of forests, peatlands, mangroves and other ecosystem habitats capable of drawing down and storing excess atmospheric carbon."

Your labor gives them value... so the interest you pay is what they're really after. Gold and precious metals are symbolic, the banks are trying to do away with them. You've been living on ' fiat currency ' that is not backed by anything.  When we go cashless, there will be nothing but digits ( no gold no bartering  etc.), and we'll be totally controlled by the banks ! Your bank account is digits on a computer... which can be entirely erased at the push of a button, and there won't be any banks to complain to..... you'll be waiting on the end of a phone cue, to argue with a machine ! No cash discounts... no  cheap ' mates rates' , all transactions will go thru a computer and include tax. Get a bad credit rating and your scrubbed from the system etc."
"Karl Pilkington","2019-05-09T12:24:46Z","The greatest fraud is the solution to global warming, not the proposition. The reason banks don't stop giving loans isn't because they know global warming isn't REAL, it's because they know it won't HAPPEN. Because the solution to global warming isn't to completely over turn the economic system, it's to implement geoengineering and either extract co2 from the atmosphere or just reflect heat from the earth, back out in to space. A single bank could pay for this geoengineering to save their property investments

The problem is; the banks don't give two shits about the ocean. Because they know the ocean will keep producing food even though it is acidifying and species are becoming extinct. The ocean is becoming more and more acidic and life is dying off... The solution to global warming is only a few billion through geoengineering which the banks will force upon the world. But the solution to ocean acidification costs more like 200 billion through geoengineering which the banks have no vested interest in paying for"
"Stamatis Stamatopoulos","2019-05-09T09:51:06Z","Idiotic argument. Capitalism doesn't work like that and he knows it better than anyone.


Which investment company would advice their potential investors not to give their money because in 50 years their investment will not exist? Which bank would ask from people to stop taking loans (their main way of making more money) because in 50 years will have a huge financial crisis? Capitalism is self destructive and that is also why we are going to see global catastrophe in the years to come: because capitalism doesn't think of the future; its only care is the ""right here and now"", the most immediate way to make money no matter what. 



Capitalism conquers markets. When that market is depleted it looks for new markets. It doesn't look back, it just moves forward like a bulldozer leaving only rubble on its wake. In the last few centuries, that meant the destroyed markets had a brake to recuperate before Capitalism was back at them again. The problem now is that with globalisation Capitalism conquered the whole planet. There is not a market left to conquer not a market to take a break from it, which means that when this final, global market is depleted there will be nothing left standing. There will be nowhere else for Capitalism to go which means it will keep strangling everything around it in its relentless effort to make more profit. Because that is the only function Capitalism is programmed to follow: ""make more profit no matter what"".


Capitalism is not a caring and sympathizing system. It is the opposite of all that. Its only care is profit at all cost as fast as possible. We have a word for that: ""greed""; but for some reason we avoid using it to characterise the dominant (the only) financial system we have on this planet.

Your argument is that they won`t invest if they would lose money in the long term. Banks can make money from thin air and what they can lose? Hi is explaining that because they are rich they see into the future.  I would say only one thing that even a very small child can understand if you have a green surface that resorbs energy and convert it to biomass. If you have a surface not covered with plants like roofs and roads, it can absorb a limited amount of energy then it starts to radiate that energy back. You can do it anywhere on Earth, take your shoes off and walk on a nice grass and after walk on a rock, sand or concrete surface. That is dry land. The water surface is bigger than the land and that can absorb the surface energy plus a portion of the radiating energy.  In `the cosmos of time` the surface was naturally covered with plants according to climate, which don`t exist anymore. Those measures can`t be implemented on the situation what we have now. Pollution is not just in the water and soil that`s in the air and that facilitates the greenhouse effect. If we won`t have any green surfaces then that won`t revert back. Or the atmosphere should expand more... This is something which should be observed and measured and not just letting a confirmation bias to accept our belief. What can happen if we take measures and turns out that we didn`t do anything wrong? We can celebrate and can calm down and be more knowledgeable. But what could happen if it turns out that those numbers are showing something which never occurred before in nature?  We should look for a solution then. It`s like when you are diagnosed with cancer if you let it grow you die. But if has to be diagnosed first, then you can make effort to eliminate. Sometimes it works sometimes it`s too late. 
I don`t like this guys behaviour. Be a little humble to others."

‚ÄúBecause taboo words are shocking, they are common in situations where people want to express powerful emotions by using 'strong' language. This is called 'swearing'. When people swear, taboo words usually change their meanings completely. For example, fuck off and piss off have nothing to do with sex or urinating - they are simply violently rude ways of saying 'go away'. The strength of the original taboo word is borrowed for a different purpose. (...) None the less, students should be very careful about using taboo words and swearwords. There are two reasons for this. First of all, it is not easy to know the exact strength of these expressions in a foreign language, or to know what kind of people are shocked by them, and in what circumstances. One may easily say something that is meant as a joke, but which seriously upsets the people one is talking to. And secondly, using this sort of language generally indicates membership of a group: one most often swears in the company of people one knows well, who belong to one's own social circle, age group etc. (Children usually avoid swearing in front of adults so as not to annoy or shock them, and adults avoid swearing in front of children for similar reasons.)‚Äù  Michael Swan's Practical English Usage"

Isn't it quite ignorant and selfish to just not care? It makes us humans look like an absolute disgrace. Seriously. Also, people in the comment section claim there are not any facts supporting global warming, but you could easily search it up and there is clear evidence that it is happening at such an intense rate it should be something to look into. Would be dumb to not do anything about it because if it's real then you're all being stupid and screwing yourselves over. If something terrible happens, don't cry or say it's unfair what's happening. Don't ask God why. You were a part of the problem. Now you and your family and the entire world faces the consequences. This is what happens when you ignore problems instead of face them head on and convince yourself that it would never happen. That is what makes a person ignorant.

The rays of the sun hit the earth, warming it up and bounce back out to space. Compounds such as Carbon dioxide are part of the atmosphere. As the rays of the sun are bouncing back, they are absorbed by such compounds and released around the compound. A lot of that released heat goes back to Earth, warming it up further.

Since the number of molecules such as Carbon dioxide have dramatically increased in the last few decades, more and more heat is being ‚Äúsent‚Äù back to Earth. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs global warming.

It's scary to contemplate the force that is going to be required considering some of the 'worst predictions'.  I hope market forces will catch up if some of the worst predictions are really true.  The worst predictions rely on catastrophic explosive methane release from the permafrost of the arctic regions.  Then I also hope, by the time we avoid that scenario, we don't miss some other deadly threat, such as a large meteor impact.  I think we are going to need an army of scientists, in many fields, not just an army of soldiers. Would be a good money saver too, if we could redirect the military money into science to save the world. I say that, even if it turns out some of the science was initially innacurate or misguided.

Opinions from authority are worthless, what matters is only what is supported by hard evidence. we're already seeing the effects of climate change, what have done for decades now. The slow gradual cyclical climatic changes of thousands of years are being exacerbated by increases in greenhouse gases. The evidence for that is overwhelming unanimous. 

I think Dan is not being critical in his reasoning here. For a smart guy he's clearly chosen a position and closed his mind on the issue"

"Chrysies","2019-04-13T17:48:31Z","There is no upper limit that could actually exist on Earth that wouldn't be beneficial. As we are currently in a CO2 starved period in Earth's history, where ""normal"" levels are between 2000-10000 ppmv/m3, we are only now reaching 400 ppmv/m3. As atmospheric CO2 increases, the planet grows more tropical. 

We've seen as a result a 20% greening of the planet, the reemergence of high carbon-consuming conifers in the Pacific north west that went extinct/dormant because of the low, near extinction levels of atmospheric CO2 that we've lived under as a result of the last Ice Age at 170 ppmv/m3. Plants die at 140 ppmv/m3, that's how close we came to the end of all land-based life on Earth.

Even at 10000 ppmv/m3 atmospheric CO2, it remains a trace gas. There is zero correlation between global temperature and these levels of CO2 as when they were 10000 ppmv/m3, we were locked in a billion year ice age. What this suggests is that Natural Forcing is on a magnitude greater than Anthropogenic Forcing, to a degree that the planet will cool/heat up regardless of whether mankind were to have ever existed. We do not drive climate, and have no discernable impact on its natural variability.

On top of this the rate of Ocean Expansion has actually slowed since the end of the last Ice Age. One need only go back 10000 years to the end of that brutal cold period and observe 400 feet of ocean expansion that lasted until about 1000 years ago, after which its now a mere 1-3 millimeters per year. The ocean would continue to expand 1-3 millimeters per year even were we to completely eliminate all sources of Anthropogenic CO2 because we have emerged from an Ice Age, and natural forcing is/will continue to slowly warm the planet, which is causing the miniscule ocean expansion that we observe today. 

Our responsibility is to learn how to most efficiently adapt to a constantly changing environment beyond our control. Its voodoo raindancing to believe that we can control the climate (literally a form of delusion)."

Perigee and apogee - along with the precession of obliquity

that when the earth is far away and the northern hemisphere is pointed at the
sun it is hot - our summer. When it is close to the sun and the northern
hemisphere is pointed away it is cold - winter. The axis of the earth rotates
365 degrees on a 22.5 degrees to 24.5degrees every 26,000 years. So what is the
outcome if we are close to the sun in our obit and the northern hemisphere is
pointed towards the sun...Really hot?¬†

location.

Here‚Äôs why his argument is flawed. 1) the banks dont own the apartments, it‚Äôs the investor who looses if it goes under water 2) the bank only looses collateral (security) not money. They loose money if the investor default on loan payments. 3) Banking executives who lend are not worried about what happens to the loans in 10-20years, they are concerned about growing their loan book and pocketing bonuses. (That‚Äôs the reason why we have plenty of debt bubbles all over the world) Finally, Bank will absolutely lend money to anything provided they can get away with it like they did with NINJA loans.. they know they‚Äôll always get bailed out and only thing that matters is bonuses."

We did most of the damage over the last 25 years, which really isn't that long ago. The last time there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere dinosaurs ruled the earth. The earth cannot sustain that much carbon being admitted in such a short period of time. If you do the math on daily carbon emissions, we are admitting 280 millions tones of Caron dioxide into the atmosphere every second. That is really scary shit and if it doesn't scare you, than you simply lack being human."

OFC I care about the environment. The things that have been done to clean up the cars and trucks were very necessary. The factories that had to clean up their act was also a very good thing. This particular situation, this fear mongering "" Global Warming"" stuff is NOT the same thing. 

I repeat- THE CORE SAMPLES DO NOT LIE.

This planet has seen axis shift. This planet has endured massive impacts from asteroids and meteorites. No-one seems to be able to turn that situation into a profitable investigation as to what we can do to prevent that catastrophe though. 
In conclusion, I have seen no proof of a specific significant warm up of this planet-nothing that we as mere humans have done to cause it, anyway.
I have seen plenty of PBS and cable ""specials"" about this subject. I wasn't impressed.
The ozone layer was damaged more in 10 seconds when Mt. St. Helens erupted than all of the R-12 (Freon) in the world being released at one time. No-one was able to stop the pesky volcano, either.

We've seen as a result a 20% greening of the planet, the reemergence of high carbon-consuming conifers in the Pacific north west that went extinct/dormant because of the low, near extinction levels of atmospheric CO2 that we've lived under as a result of the last Ice Age at 170 ppmv/m2.

Its a vicious political cycle thatbanks and even politicians to some degree get rich when people can't afford their own home mortgages or loans and foreclosure or bankruptcy is the only way out and the bank steps in and repoes the property only to resale the property at double the previous price mean while the politicians taxing the property are making bank twice over on the forclosed property:
1) for the foreclosure tax on the property
2) for the global warming tax that the former home owner paid for because of a scare tactic hoax tax payers vote for.

There are not enough young people to pay the current taxes so climate change tax was yet another way to get a little more money.

How about not making stupid promises that can't be kept. How much of the climate change taxes actually go into developing solutions to the supposed problems of climate change eg forest fires, flooding? A tiny amount. How much is used to cover government promises? We have heard the same scare story repeated from school about CO2 killing the world so we should do the following: don't drive, don't fly, don't eat meat, don't fuck, don't consume, don't switch the heating on, don't think the government is always right, don't do anything, pay your taxes and die quietly. Your purpose is to hide in a cave, work and die. I say fuck the tossers and do the opposite to most of those things, work hard and looks for solutions to current problems.

Climate change has existed since the dawn of time. There are cycles hot and cold etc. It has never been static.

If the climate change lobby are worried about C02 from burning fossil fuels guess what? Fossil fuels are getting more expensive especially oil where drilling needs to keep going deeper. Solar is getting cheaper, vehicles are generally getting more fuel efficient, modern buildings have standards of a minimum insulation requirement. There will reach a point where fossil fuels are so difficult to get the alternatives are cheaper as energy - that is just economics."

The only enemy is mental midgets like you. But the shot will eventually hit the fan. It always does. And it won't be because of climate. If you bothered to do your research, which I have, you'd know there's plenty of data debunking this nonsense. You'd also know these ""scientists"" got caught falsifying data. Your also know that the questions asked of these ""scientists"" are designed to get a consensus. I can ask leading questions to get a consensus on anything. It's a political trick nothing more. Now if you'd like to argue facts instead of insulting one another feel free. Can you point to a time in history when the climate hasn't been changing?

""Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest.""
--- Deuteronomy 23:19 (NIV)


They got around that by becoming the middle-man: loaning to non-Jews who in turn loaned money to anyone, Jews included. Keeping the letter of the law while ignoring the spirit of the law. Same idea behind selling the land for one year during a 'Sabbath year'


""10 For six years you are to sow your land and gather its produce, 11 but in the seventh year you must let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat of the field, and the wild animals may consume what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and olive grove.‚Ä¶""
--- Exodus 23:10-11 (NIV); see also Leviticus 25:3 and Nehemiah 10:31


They would ""sell"" (really lease) the land for one year to a gentile that had no restrictions and could plant and farm during the year the land was to lay fallow (if 'owned' by a Jew). Doing stuff like that led directly to the Babylonian Captivity. 


'This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.""
--- Jeremiah 25:11


Israel had apparently failed to observe the land‚Äôs one-year-in-seven sabbath for 490 years, so the term of the Babylonian captivity was set at 70 years to make up the deficit.  


‚ÄúThe land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah.‚Äù 
--- 2 Chron. 36:21

Sure CO2 is not as potent as Methane or nitrous oxide since it has less complex vibrational modes but it still is able to absorb infrared radiation with its own complex vibrational modes that allow it to absorb infrared radiation. Plus the fact that it's the most concentrated gas with 420 ppm (parts per million) in the average atmosphere, which is an all time high in the past thousands of years, should . And guess what? All the greenhouse gases that you claim CO2 is not as potent as, are also emitted by the production of natural gas, transport of coal, and oil. The fact that you said that we could double our greenhouse emissions without it having any effect on global warming is completely unreasonable and a lie that you made up with little to no research. If that were the case, WE WOULD STILL BE IN THE FREAKING ICE AGE and WE WOULD HAVE NO WEATHER, Earth would be unsuitable for us to live in."

‚ÄúThe higher the co2 it loses its effectiveness‚Äù do you have any stats proving this? It seems to go against established science. I‚Äôll site a source for this if you site where the hell you got that idea from. 

Higher temperatures do much more than affects plants. Many nations will be fully underwater, there will be more and more hurricanes, more wildfires. These things affect not only plants, but all species of animals including humans. Co2 itself may not be so bad, but the warming effect it has on our planet is what can and will be devastating."

However there is too many of us, and not enough time to change it, it will have to be a global movement for it to happen and an exorbitant cost that no one will be willing to pay.

When the food and the water scarce, and the air will make us sick, the human race will suffer and diminish in numbers, an unfortunate even for the species that will be extinct when that happens.

The argument with banks is not a valid one either. I get this guy's economic background. Economy is smart and figures out the best prices and the best use for scarce resources itself. But it's not flawless. Look at the 2008 crisis. Why did the banks loaned money to already bloated market and lowered their requirements for a loan? Because they make mistakes too.

He claims that by coincidence, he met an unnamed scientist, at an unnamed , five hundred million dollar facility. He claims he heard a speech on global warming. He claims to have seen sample cores. He claims to have been told by an unnamed scientist, that global warming is cyclical, ""fart in the wind etc..."" .Those are a lot of claims. So, basically a  regurgitation of information from an unspecified source. His Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration does not allow him to reach a conclusion on his own. I'm talking about qualified, hands on research.  He relies on the supposed research of others. Second hand information. At 3:44 he directs his discussion back to his true focus of  making money, and reaching/calming investors. This is where he shines. This is his true focus. He reduces an argument about climate change to Florida real estate, and  condos. You know, the ""important"" stuff. Here we see the real Pe√±a. His argument up on that stage is this in a nut shell. ""Climate change is not real. If it was, waterfront, Real Estate Developers would have included the dangers of rising sea levels in the investment perspective. Because Florida Real Estate Developers, and Banks have always proven to be  straight shooters right? They wouldn't dream of selling you swamp land in Florida.

And i have clearly demonstrated that your one real point is a foolish assumption at best. I do want to address the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù comment about how he doesnt want to talk to experts.

"BartVanLinschoten","2019-03-16T08:01:31Z","J P See that‚Äôs the thing, the government demands that we should invest our own money so that we can accomplish the goals set in the climate policy. But it has never been proved that these measures will actively decrease the temperature on earth. Even if you believe that we contribute to preventing climate change by following these measures, it won‚Äôt do much good because other big polluting countries such as China and India won‚Äôt cooperate. They will even increase their fabrication and thus the amount of CO2 and pollutant emmisions. So we‚Äôre gonna put my country at major risk by continuing.

The ‚Ç¨10000,- is just an indication. It can go up to ‚Ç¨45000,- depending on the house. It is not montly, but it‚Äôs a one-time investment, or that‚Äôs what the government tells us at least. They require replacement as well so it‚Äôs gonna be 10-15 years till the next payment. It is used for isolation and more things that have to do with efficiently using energy, buy I don‚Äôt know the English words for them so excuse me. But the idea is that we put strict rules for each house just like we put rules on food-quality, and we‚Äôre gonna have to pay for it ourselves.

Now here comes the tricky part. The political party‚Äôs that stand for this climate pollicy tell us that we can save the world and that our children will die if we don‚Äôt listen to them. They play in on their emotions. A few arguments of them to pull it off:
- Climate is important, our kids shouldn‚Äôt live with the problem that we created. (Evoking guilt)
- We are going to be #1 in the world when it comes to green innovation. (Other countries will still surpass us even if we take the measures) (Evoking feelings of proudness and superiority)
- Other countries will follow us if we set the bar high. (Argument based on nothing, countries will go on let us be stupid) (Making us feel mighty and noble)
- We need to be self-reliant when it comes to energy supply. (Research has found that we can‚Äôt provide the needed energy with just windmills and solar panels, because we don‚Äôt have enough space and it will cost us more than it will give us. They deny that nuclear energy is the solution.)
- What about the plastic-soup, smog, streetlitter, polluting factory‚Äôs etc. (It‚Äôs all about environment, but the average Dutch person will fall for it)

The thing that enfuriates me is that they don‚Äôt think nuclear energy is a solution. It‚Äôs literally the cheapest, safest, greenest and yieldest option there is. It seems that they‚Äôre too lazy to do research on it.

Sorry for the rant on my government. üòÇüòÇ To answer your question: No, we will not experience a significant increase in the air-quality when we invest the money in our houses, or for any measure in climate-policy for that matter, because it‚Äôs simply not related with each other. I‚Äôm all for decreasing pollutants, but it‚Äôs not really that big of a problem in my country because factory‚Äôs have to follow strict measures about that."
"eCasinoMoney","2019-03-16T00:31:00Z","@BartVanLinschoten 10,000 Euros is quite a sum of money. I think the most interesting part about your comment is: ""When politicians are being asked about this, they often reply with something *environmentally* related"". A layman like me would have believed them two days ago. But knowing more now, I can question these political campaigns more.


Continuing on with your governments plan-- if we put aside reducing CO2, will the plan actually help prevent pollutants in the air (as a side effect)? Pollutants have been well documented to have an harmful effect on human health. By continuing on with this plan, will you experience a significant increase in air quality that will justify spending 10,000 Euros per month on every household?"
"BartVanLinschoten","2019-03-15T16:01:25Z","J P , Thanks for agreeing with me. People never seem to take my point of view. Example:

My government is making a plan to prevent climate change which will cost the citizens about 1000 billion euro‚Äôs in the next 30 years. There‚Äôs no evidence that the measures will actually lead to result. 

They want to reduce CO2 emmissions by 49% in the next ten or so years. Their plan is to shut of the gas, tax company‚Äôs for their greenhouse gas emmisions and demanding their citizens to make their homes CO2-neutral by investing ‚Ç¨10000+ per household.

So we‚Äôre now spending that amount of money for something that hasn‚Äôt been thought through. When politicians are being asked about this, they often reply with something environmentally related. Still, people vote for these parties even though I try to debate the negative effects with them. I live in The Netherlands by the way."
"eCasinoMoney","2019-03-15T13:18:49Z","@BartVanLinschoten sensible comment. Glad somebody can communicate without berating somebody else.

Pena's comment on global warming is definitely an eye opener. But I think pullution is definitely an issue. Major cities like Beijing are flooded with smog everyday and people have to wear masks to protect themselves when they go outside.

I think pollution for sure has an effect on human health. But the question is, if medicine will be able to catch on and neutralize the harmful effects that pollution has on humans"

Since the last ice age ended and the climate stabilized it has stayed between 200 ppm and 280 ppm for r the last 10000 years or so. Now, in the past century, the ppm has risen to over 400 ppm and still climbing. That‚Äôs bc before humans the CO2 from the ocean and the CO2 being absorbed by the ocean was even, now with humans there is more CO2 in the air than the oceans can absorb.

One is an interpreter of data who can influence the result to fit their hypothesis. There is no threat of world destroying climate change. The earth warms, the earth cools.

Also, the extreme destructive force of climate change all around the world far outweighs some small benefits that some areas of the world might see. These are facts. Also I'm not replying anymore because I don't have time to argue with people who dont understand science. If you dont already understand how it works, no facts will ever convince you.

You make the money when you sell to another buyer or into the market at a higher multiple, in a bull market.

If you haven't done it you're still a wanna be. Do as Dan recommends: go find your dream team of directors, big 4 accountant (negotiate delayed fee payment), magic circle law firm (negotiate delayed fee payment), get the funding, find the businesses to acquire. Repeat and list on the market or find investors to continue the expansion. Have an exit plan in place, floating on the market or being acquired by a large buyer."

The local government keeps raising everyone's taxes so they can ""band aid"" the problem with bigger pumping stations. Flood insurance and homeowners insurance increases every year. Meanwhile the local politicians quietly passed laws that make the homeowners responsible to pay for raising of their seawall,which used to be the local governments responsibility; since it's part of the infrastructure, etc, etc.
So, instead of addressing the underlying problem of rising sea level, they choose to keep people ignorant about the problem, so the politicians, the big construction companies, insurance companies and banks still gets ahead and profit, no matter what.

Then, the institution that has the mortgage will package it with other mortgages to make a mortgage backed-security (bond), which will be sold to a pension fund. So when the loans will go to shit (because of the ‚Äúrising sea levels‚Äù, let‚Äôs say), the consumers will suffer cause their pensions will vanish. The banks won‚Äôt be affected cause they don‚Äôt hold the loans anymore. So yeah, not convinced by his argument at all."

If we disagree on science then can disagree on basically anything since science is the only purely objective thing that we have. And since we can‚Äôt learn all the scientific knowledge of the universe, we‚Äôre gonna have to trust people who actually studied the topic. We can‚Äôt prove everything by ourselves, but if other people proved it, then it must be true"
"Elvis Presley","2019-03-10T19:19:12Z","@D.a .n.a My short answer to you about science..... We cannot know from science if science itself is the best source of knowledge.
There are two possibilities when it comes to human knowledge through science. The first is that everything¬†real is actually reducible to scientific principles. Everything‚Äîfrom the universe, to human emotion, to spiritual experiences‚Äîis explainable through scientific research. The other option is simple: Not all existence can be explained through science.
Here‚Äôs why this question matters. If the first option is true, then logically¬†science is the supreme mode of knowledge, and everything we believe about anything must be in submission to it. The problem, though, is that whether¬†all of¬†reality is ultimately explainable through scientific concepts is not itself a scientifically provable theory. It‚Äôs a philosophical premise, not a scientific conclusion. The only way to definitively prove that science explains everything would be to have exhaustive knowledge of all reality, and then be able to explain (using only scientific data) what all reality is and what it means. Such a feat is impossible. Therefore, the belief that science is the best source of knowledge must be accepted on faith, since it cannot be verified through testing."

Just keep sucking up what the TV tells you and your ecologist mayor who works a mayor and not an ecologist. I was old enough to remember the same story from around 92, they were preaching global warming in my primary school, but there are stories from the 80's on global warming too, possibly earlier if you look for them. Now the TV is telling people by 2050 it's going to be all over unless we give them money on top of our new innovations and recycling. The temperature isn't changing the way they claim it is and they've be making these claims for 30 years or more. At some point you have to stop and think, hang on a second... Why are they saying the same things for 30+ years and I've not seen the resulted predictions yet? There are a lot of independent thinkers like myself out there who unplugged their televisions a long time ago. I think you need to turn your TV off and go outside and realise all the bad stuff it's telling you isn't the world we actually live in for the most part.

The political global elitist can use these proven tactics to increase influential power by selling/brainwashing the end of days ploy. These ploys have been used since spoken language was invented! Just look at all the deaths that occult leader zealots have cause in the last couple hundred of years alone. You wonder how thousands of people can commit suicide like Jonestown in 1978. These brainwashed people were just average people. No real differences from you and I. The global masses can easily be convinced in some impending doom scenario to keep the influential alarmists in control and in power. Kim Jung Un keeps power in his micro economy by convincing the NK masses through media and education that the evil US and its allies are going to destroy them if they don't sacrifice and stay vigilant. This control is in spite SK's pleas to the NK public through radio channels and pamphlets that the western allies are peaceful. Hitler himself was quoted to say ""The great masses of the people will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one.""  It's a good propaganda technique! It's all about keeping power.

""The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.1

Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.

The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.

Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth‚Äôs climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.3"""

If any of you had the brains to actually look at empirical data, youd realize very quickly how dangerous it really is. If we continue on the road we are now, not that its going to happen in 100 or 200 years, youre gonna start seeing serious change in only 10 fucking years. By 2050, the world will be unrecognizable. It's so much more complex than what these fools make it out to be. If you're interested, it doesent take long to find the research. The scientific community has told us over and over again, that climate change is REAL, and that its a byproduct of human actions taken on earth. Not only the scientific community, but INSURANCE companies even. Nobody ever said global warming is equal everywhere around the earth. In fact, there are places, where sea levels have DECREASED, for example, on the west coast of the US. But in places like the east coast of asia, sea levels have risen over 7cm in the last years. The water isnt going to rise 10 feet, or 100 feet, its not going to rise half that much. Its not necessarily the rise of the worlds oceans, its what comes with it. Its melting the permafrost, which contains millions of years of stored up carbon, which if released will mean the end of human civilization, and this is not an exaggeration, its very real, and the research is there to back it up. If we do not slow down, if we do not change our way of life as a species, we will go extinct on this planet, and that, is a FACT. Now, I await the keyboard warrior brigade patiently, go ahead, go wild on me, thats your right. However, maybe think about in stead of bashing me, to ask me questions. Try and disprove me, and I will more than happily tell you what I know. If you can disprove the theory of climate change to me, I wont fight it. I'm interested in the truth, not whatever truth suits me. so please, do your best to convince me."

Yet, the causes are not 100 % clear. There are 1000 factors that you have to take into account before you can say that it's caused by humans or nature.

I think we face much bigger challenges nowadays with ocean pollution,  deforestation, plastic and so on that we cannot afford to speculate whether climate change is real and what the causes are.

That money is fake and banks will always get bailouts and more licences if something goes wrong. If global warming is real they will just continue to invest and give loans to those who survive to keep them under control. Financial institutions will adjust few numbers on a f****** computer untill its too late and real disaster strikes. If life will be unberable on surface of this planet these people will hide in deep under ground  luxury bunkers far from angry people. They are psychopaths, so why should they care about what happens to this planet? 
But trust me they are going to lose eventually also because AI will outsmart them.
 Its also possible that AI might actually decide to reverse the damage humans has done to  earth and bring back natures balance and harmony. It would allow us to progress and evolve but not in technological sense. Im guessing it would be more interested in our consciousness and spiritualism. There would be peace for more than 1000 years just like some visionaries predicted  (Nostradamus ie.). And again we might even surpass the machines by developing some new skills in the process of our true enlightenment that would seem to us today like pure magic or miracles. Unfortunately our biological need for total control would bring wars against machines, life, people and other entities that exists here already but we are now too blind to see them yet. That war might be the end of everything, even the whole cosmos. 
We shouldn't worry however as we are already slowly starting to realise that its all just a dream. In the world where everything is possible, nothingness is inevitable. 
 Then in no time (because time will also cease to exist) a new identical dream of everything including you reading this creazy YouTube post of some depressed existencially as f*** and lost middle aged guy will start a new cycle that is ofcourse endless since always and forever."

Antarctica is on a mountain top: No, it's an entire continent.

The world temperature increased by 2 degrees thousands of years ago and is cyclical, therefore global warming is a fraud - Yes, these temperature increases are cyclical, but that's not the point. Climate change isn't the fact that the world is getting warmer again, it's the fact that this time, it's irreversible. With all the CO2 and other greenhouse gases that we are pumping into the atmosphere (which by the way was not the case thousands of years ago), the temperature will go up, but never come down, unlike the cyclical nature of earth's natural changes in temperature.

In the footnotes of contracts for beachfront properties, they never mention the risk of climate change - first of all, that is the wrong way to look at it. Contracts don't dictate climate change, climate change dictates contracts. Also, economics in this sense is all about the short term gain (25 or so years). While predictions say the sea level will rise by an amount that is sufficient enough to drown these properties, it will be more economically sound for people to invest in both beach properties then find ways to stop properties from drowning (high sea walls and other methods) than to not invest in beach properties in the first place. Banks care about money, not the environment.

The current scientific thought is that the Earth has about 5 billion years left. The lifespan of the earth is wholly dependent upon the ageing of the sun. In about 5 to 6 billion years from now, the sun is going to reach a point where its core can no longer sustain the nuclear fusion as it has been and it will evolve into a red giant. Therefore, that means the sun could grow large enough to engulf the earth, but even if it doesn't, life will still cease to exist on earth at some point during the sun's transformation into a red giant. There endeth the lesson."

On his point about it being 2¬∞ colder now I believe he thinks that it will all simmer out and everything will revert back to normal based on whats happend in the past, however Earth has never had a civilisation as sophisticated as ours and certainly not one that produced as many emmisions and carcinogenic fumes as we currently do. Therefore he cannot assume that Global warming comes in cycles because we are constantly evolving and producing more gaseous waste.

The thing about climate change isn't the fact that the world gets x degrees hotter in y years. This is what I assume you mean by predicting this phenomenon. The important thing is that, after it becomes self-sustaining (dissolved CO2 from the seas start getting into the air exponentially), it's not looking good for humanity.

When I said that the temperature will come up but never come down, I meant it won't come down during our lifetimes or the life of the human race. We would all be dead due to climate change by then, but life will go on after.

Also, with the banks, they will invest in these beachfront properties for short term gain, then invest that money in other areas that benefit from climate change (sea walls etc.). I might be wrong. All what I said about banks was just going off my logic."

You said that ""because of all the CO2 and other greenhouse gases we are pumping into the atmosphere the temperature will go up but never come down."" I do not have the numbers but I assume that throughout the eons, volcanic activity and other natural disasters produce far more CO2 and other harmful gases than what we have since the industrial evolution. For instance, wasn't the CO2 levels aprox. 5 times higher during the Dinosaur era? And yet, the cyclical nature of earth's natural changes in temperature continued. 

Also, you said that ""banks care about money, not the environment."" Well, if environmental changes means dramatic decrease in moneterial gain, wouldn't that be important to them and influence their decision-making?"

The reason that beachfront property continues to be made in Florida, is because flood insurance is run by the federal government and backs up their investments. It's also not law that real estate agents have to disclose sea level rise projections for that property.

September 30th of 2019 Congress will have a meeting to discuss FEMA and the federal flood insurance program.

Taxing breath (which is what they want to do to you) isn't going to fix anything. The Dinosaurs didn't cause the Ice Age, and you've been had if you actually believe they did.

"John Martin","2019-02-23T01:29:39Z","@Graham Salway Pure B.S. There is no proof that 0.04% of CO2 in the Atmosphere is or has had any meaningful effect. The Geologic record shows that historic changes in temperature led, not followed, CO2 increases throughout history. The correlation is the reverse of what would be required for CO2 to be the driver. That is also true for the last 150 years using thermometers. Jim Hansen of NASA was preaching Global cooling during the 70's before he had his vision and turned to Global warming. None of his predictions nor Al Gores's has come to pass. The UN gave the IPCC' the charge to look at gases only, not the impact of Solar activity. They had there mission and are ruled by politicians from around the world who take the the summary of every IPCC Report and decide what it should say and give it back to the IPCC staff to use to fix the underlying Chapters of the Report. The IPCC is not comprised of the best and the brightest scientists and most are not scientists but writers. I decided to find out for myself the truth and the King has no clothes. It is a large hoax devised for political reasons. Look at the Tony Heller website and his work to show the cherry picking of data used to cry wolf by sounding the alarm on extreme weather temperature changes, hurricanes. tornadoes droughts and trends in temperatures for the past 150 years. NOAH and NASA has for decades massaged the data for questionable purposes, and that is being charitable. If you are a scientist you should know. The great scientists whether geologic, atmospheric, astrophysics, oceanographic, or meteorological  that I have listened to and read are not in consensus with Mann not his hockey stick which is made built by eliminating both the middle age warming and the little ice age. Look to The Heartland Institute for reference to the recent survey that has more than 30,000 signatures, 9,000 of which are Phd's that give a lie to the fraudulent 97% consensus survey developed by a non-scientist undergrad which is debunked. Must be true though as our last President said it was and ""everybody"" knows. Not.
What has been done to create this hoax has wasted treasure and lives for decades. In Africa the poor are denied clean fired coal plants to give them light and energy to allow them to advance and improve their lot. Rather they burn cow dung in squalid huts and breath the fumes and millions die decades before their time. Meanwhile the Climate Elite fly around and meet and eat and produce material so journalists whose knowledge is zip but have great creative writing skills to scare everybody. And given man creates less than 5 % of all CO2, we could quit farting by dying off and it would not have a measurable effect. 
Fortunately the blinders are coming off, slowly albeit. Hopefully we are not heading into a Grand Solar Minimum, as many scientists believe, even though it would likely put a final stake into this enormous lie. ""the earth climate is fragile and natural and any subtle change has dramatic effects"" that is not science kid but it is creative writing."
"Graham Salway","2019-02-22T00:36:22Z","The earths climate warms and cools over 1000's of years not in the space of 20 years. Therefore any change in the climate is because of humans. Just because 99.9986% of co2 is non man made does not mean we have no effect because the earth climate is fragile and natural and any subtle change has dramatic effects. Although changes in climate now are minimal compared to previous changes, a minimal change in the earth climate can easily wipe out the human race"

Rotting organic material hasn‚Äôt changed and is apart of the natural cycle and increased wild fires is a effect of global warming not really a cause, however there increasing existence may be contributing to it at this point but that‚Äôs humans fault anyway. And as for ur point that cooling and warming is natural, this is not natural. Nature never moves this fast without a very big disruption, such as the meteor that killed the dinosaurs or a massive volcanic eruption from a volcano like the one under yellow stone. Something that is unusual and throws off the natural balance of the planet. That‚Äôs what humans are. They are an interference that is throwing off nature and causing massive destruction. And funny thing about those other examples of severe disruptions in nature, all of them end with colossal damage of the planet and even mass extinctions on occasion. Now whether humans will cause that is yet to be seen bc we can‚Äôt see the future we can only predict. It is however a large risk that we will severely damage the ecosystem and our own environment.

"Moses Rodrigues","2019-02-14T04:02:56Z","I won't claim that the claims of ""climate change"" are all accurate, true, and absolute, but this man's logic and rhetoric are terrible. Any person well-studied in the general foundations of the environmental sciences will know that this man has a major flaws in his train of thought and can easily counter argue it. The levels of gases in the atmosphere from many millenia ago argument is offers a humblimg benchmark but it's completely relevant to the life on Earth during that time. I could go in depth to critique this but it's simply a poor argument if you understand the relative value applicable to a given environment during a given time. Biological life can't just simply be swapped out to exist unaffected during a time period far beyond the natural progressions of evolutionary adaptations. Wish it could be true but that's not how nature works. Aside from that major flawed argument of his, the other is the bank investments. This, again, is nonsense. If resource loss held an intrinsically negative value, destructive wars would have never thrived to the degree that they have. Just as an understanding of the environmental sciences matters, so does an understanding of economics. If one truly knows the Capitalist system of monetary-market economics, such as Dan Pe√±a (assumingly), they most definitly know the system does not care about resource loss. It's call return customers; it's called insurance; it's called collavorative corruption; it's called business as usual. Again, I do not completely subscribe to the generalized claims of climate change but it's sad how many uninformed and uneducated people are desperate to flock at governmental manipulation to such an extremist degree. Sure, governements are self-interested and nefarious in many ways, but it doesn't mean we need to throw the baby out with the bathwater on the debatable topics of sustainable practices for our society on this planet during this given time. Talk to me about it anytime. I love it. P.S. - the London Real dude is nothing more than an individual expression of the goverments of the world: self-interested and business-driven, holding up an increasingly obvious facade of disingenuous pursuits, especially as he makes more money."

Show me the science not opinion. His assessment is ridiculous. The planet changes with and without us but to assert we have no impact is simply not true. The planet also didn't have people on it for most of its existence and the planet doesn't have feelings one way or the other what happened or happens but the people who want survivable conditions should care. Species go extinct everyday and we will be no different in the end but how long we are around is partly determined by what we do in our environment. Asserting that somehow because investment contracts have specific language is meaningless. People scam each other all the time. Look at the financial crisis that wiped out huge banks and the rest required the government to bail them out.

25,000 years ago, when the last period of global warming, there was no civilization of our technical development. The creatures at that time, including prehistorian man, slowly adjusted these changes. Today, we will have to say goodbye to our technical assistance at 2.5 degrees higher temperatures. It means that there will be no permanent supply of electricity, communication, transport, food, etc.
The only one who survived a lot of climate change from the Ice Age to hot periods in the present Europe was Neanderthal man. And he existed for 250,000 years. Imagine this number. And we boast of the last 250 years of industrialization and technological development? The Neanderthal survived for so long as it did not depend on technology, but he adapted to changes. We are not capable of this, so we have to be very careful about all the already indicative signs of global warming.
From my online book (page 142) ""ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE"" on Ecohumanworld web site
Nature does not exist because of us, but we are like all other beings created because of certain needs in nature itself. If the need for our presence on this planet passes, it will also pass away the creature that has existed because of those needs ‚Äì the human being.
Nature is the ultimate master of this planet. She creates life and ensures that never fails. Its laws are still present, the only real and permanent functioning. They are the foundations of existence,
are the nature itself. Existential justification is a one-time gift of nature, an opportunity that allows all in the context of the natural laws to survival. Who consciously or unconsciously ignored these laws, disrupts their balance and harmony, must expect that sooner or later his right to existence on this planet runs out. Also we are no exception."

==Apparently english isn't your first language or your 2nd language.
Read again what I wrote. We were talking about the carbon tax. Talking about ecological issues such as global warming is part of having a general education. It is no different than talking about why recycling is important in class at grade 1 or 2 and so on.

So, it is not the goal of ""global warming"" to make people more aware of the planet.  The goal is talking about potential problems such as global warming and to talk about possible solutions."

"Ecohumanworld","2019-02-14T19:17:30Z","@farfiman If you sunbathe on the beach and the temperature is 30 degrees and then increases to 32.5 degrees, it is slightly hotter. If you get sick and your body temperature rises from 27, 2 degrees to 39.7, you do not feel good anymore. You're sick. It's the same with the planet. If the temperature rises by an average of 2.5 degrees it means that it is sick. Time processes associated with extreme summer with long-term droughts, fires and hurricanes in the summer, snowstorms with very low temperatures in winter, etc., will start. This is happening now, but only in a short-term and local context. In the case  of a global collapse of the climate balance, these events are transmitted over the long term to the whole planet. And these unfavorable weather conditions will prevent the operation of nuclear power plants because they will have to be disconnected from the electricity network because the water level of the river, which cools the core of the reactor, will fall too far. Hurricane winds are conditioned by the shutdown of wind power plants, the power lines will be broken down by wind, snow, frost and ice ... and I could still list it. And if there is no electricity, there is no transport, no heating, no communication, no food industry ... If there is no electricity, there is no gas, no heating of housing, no work...etc. We are biological creatures living on a biological planet. The planet can be technologically burdened only to the extent permitted, but not as much as we want. We think that we can afford everything, and that can cost us our existence."

If you truly believe the warming of the planet is inevitable, you should be campaigning for people to move inland and prepare.

However, taxation will NEVER reverse the affect, and stagnating technological or industrial advancement is suicide in itself. We must expand and adapt. It is what we do best.

These are a phenomena in which global CO2 and temperatures have risen and fallen in a constant pattern of high and low peaks and troughs during the last glacial period, and even further back into the Holocene period. Antarctic and Greenland Ice Core data gathered from 2.6 million years of glaciological layers is solid, undeniable, unequivocal evidence that the Earth's climate and temperatures rise and fall naturally, cyclically, and regularly, without our help. What's more, the data suggests that at the end of each warming period, there is a significant spike in temperature of between 5 and 8 degrees globally that OCCURS OVER JUST SEVERAL DECADES just before the fall into another cold snap. A bit like what is happening right now. Which just so happens to coincide with our current position within the Dansgaard - Oeschger Event cycle. Science is not just fun, it's always consistent - you won't find science changing it's brand name from Global Warming to Climate Change when it decides to contradict the agenda."

The truth is no one know it for sure, because its a very complex topic. Some scientists said it caused CO2 emission, but many scientists said the opposite. Everybody who ever lived in ice cold winter knows how difficult to keep the house warm for many reasons. Its true the CO2 with 0.0164 has a slighly lower thermal conductivity than the air with 0.0262, meaning CO2 is a better thermal insulation and favor the global warming. But its difficult to make a conclusion that CO2 is the only root cause of global warming."
"The loffikilli","2019-02-17T04:25:26Z","@wyswyg Sommer That's why they want to reduce CO2 emission because those gas traps heat which makes it difficult for it to escape to space resulting in a rise of global temperature"

I have never seen such an ammount of unwisdom and ignorance combined in one human being.
All of his arguments are just ripped out of context and factually wrong.
Yes, in the ages of the dinosaurs, the earth was warmer than today. But the distribution of land and water was also much different. Hence huge disparities in rainfall etc. to what we see today.
Plus, back then, the tropic climate was somewhat suitable to harbor huge reptiles. Not for mammals. Not for the complex sealife we have today. Yes, life would still be possible on a warmer earth. Just not for all humans, or the societies we live in. 
This argument is retarded.

Secondly: he argues with BANKINVESTMENTS?! WHAT?!
Banks _speculate_ on profit. They do not _know_ things. They just assess the risk and invest accordingly. Given that Florida will be around for quite a while after the investment, profit will be made regardless of the longevity of the investment. 

This guy is toxic. I would suggest a therapy but at this stage I'm afraid that the best cure for this amount of toxicity is emergency slaughter.

I know there is no direct proof to climate change as it is tedious to fetch data on such a larger scale and then bind it's cause to specific activity.
However, we can still agree on the fact that our actions like deforestation or use of fuels are surely aggravating the seemingly climate change.
This is same as cause and effect. We all know smoking causes cancer but if a smoker gets cancer, we can't surely say it's due to smoking. In the same way, burning fuels does contribute to global warming.

This is what is going to happen.  New York city will flood.   the people will move.  They have only been there for really 100 years.  All of the big buildings were built in the last 100 years.   So they will be abandoned and people will move inland.  Probably won't need these buildings anyway,  Offices will all be virtual and you will work from home.  or not work at all and robots will do everything."

Of course I know natural  climate changes, such as from snowball earth to a warm earth  took millions of years to happen.  However, there has also been rapid natural climate change in the past. We know the changing of Antarctica from a tropical forest to continent  permanently covered by thick ice happened rapidly due to natural causes because scientists found bodies of animals with tropical vegetation in their mouths and stomachs preserved by ice in Antarctica. 


Your assertion that there was no rapid natural climate change in the past is so ignorant. There could have been a lot more rapid natural climate changes in prehistory. Just because you were not there to witness them doesn't mean they did not happen. 
You claim  there has been ""drastic increase"" of climate change in the last 150 years because of the exaggeration of the global warming scammers and because of  your ignorance about the existence of rapid natural climate changes in prehistoric times.


Bangladesh is a low lying country which is doomed to be affected by sea water just like other low lying locations adversely affected by sea water during hurricanes such the reclaimed lands from the sea in New York and reclaimed land on the swamp in New Orleans.

Most people who have problems with climate change, global warming or whatever you call it just don‚Äôt understand the basic life support services supplied by ecosystems globally, and yeah it warms and cools and seas go up and down, but the spatial scale of the damage currently occurring- which is undeniably due partly to human action isn‚Äôt something that can go on sustainably. Who cares if the people with oil are lying or the scientists are lying, it‚Äôs about the fact that without rapid changes towards a more sustainable approach to the way we treat this world we aren‚Äôt going to be here for much longer. Or even if our species does survive, it‚Äôs not going to be an attractive situation- global poverty epidemics, famines, droughts, natural disasters.

Its true that the Earth has natural cycles but what he is not saying is our current cylcle is in fact the fastest temp change on records by a long way. Every year we have record ice melts now which in itself is not a massive issue yet but once global sea temps start to increase sea water will begin to expand. Do a experiment put cold water in a cup measure the lv then heat the same water up and measure it again. You will see the lv increase. Not only this the ice melting will cool the Northern Atlantic ocean at that point the Gulf Stream will change in turn changing our climate massively and in time sending us into a Ice Age. Im not suggesting this will happen im telling you it is going to happen.    I have not even got onto the potential for volcanic Super Eruptions and massive Earthquaks as the ocean pressure changes. What he said about the banks and insurance companys is also false when flooding dose happen we are going to have to build alot of new infrastructure which will create growth and jobs."

What we DON'T know is whether the cycle would continue if the swings get wider. It is not unfathomable that there is a threshold above which the cycle will break. We witness this phenomenon all the time in nature. 2) Now, the banks. Are they the best prognosticators in the world? Because I don't think they are, I can't follow the second argument. I just hope people are critical either way. I can't say what will happen, but I think we should prepare for the worst. Don't rely on people with money to do it. 3) Lastly, the scam perspective is not completely without merit. Catastrophic climate change is a non-zero probability event, but I can imagine some trying to magnify the probability and urgency in order to profit. But there is also people who truly believe it is urgent. The whole spectrum is out there. Where are you and what are you going to do about it?"

The temperatures plunged to the coldest ever seen in this age; the cause being attributed to various volcanic eruptions. Air pollution caused extreme cold - not warming. It didn't end until the 1870s. CO2 is still not a significant factor in pollution, mainly because it all comes back down to the ground.

Areas of Earth having record cold and hot temperatures. This mainly has been happening in the last 40 years. If you don't believe me just look up pole shift history graph. That's will get you started on entering the Rabbit Hole. Also there are changes on all the planets in our solar system. We are not the cause but it seems to me there is another Force out there causing these changes. The only two theories I can come up with is our solar system is moving through a different area of space in that the Milky Way galaxy or there is another planet that moves around our solar system in a much larger orbit which only happens to pass into our solar system every few thousand or maybe hundreds of thousands of years"

There reports by Savants of 100 million years of dry spell and 2 million years of continuous rain such that it is just cyclic.

"lord thick nipples","2018-12-30T12:07:19Z","One question on my mind, who exactly benefits from global warming? 
And think about it, who benefits from everyone believing climate change is a myth? 
Let's just say we've been sacrificing good people's lives for a certain limited resource that is killing our planet. Ultimately to get rich quick, in a basic summary.

I still don't know who's getting rich off of global warming, could someone please tell me?
I do know that oil and natural gas companies are already extremely rich, and they just keep making more money exponentially. And eventually we're going to run out of those limited resources. If we go down the path america is going down today, when the day comes and we run out of oil, we will be absolutely FUCKED.
And climate change being a very real thing we'd probably be dead before that happens (it's not as far away as it would seem, last 10 years have been the hottest on record, and multiple species have gone extinct or have been pushed to the brink of extinction because of humans)
So here's a fucking idea how about we use resources that won't ever run dry and have little to no impact on the environment


Also it's pretty shameful how he just cuts her off in the middle of her sentence ""YOU""RE FULL OF SHIT LMAO"" really shows how intelligent and mature these people are. How can you be so disrespectful and still have a sense of pride about it? 
It's funny how they're surprised when she gets angry. That's the natural response to ignorance, is it not?
He didn't listen to any scientific arguments because he immediately dismissed them as bullshit. Probably one of the most closed minded individuals I've ever seen. He got shown some evidence a long time ago by a few scientists and now his mind is made up, he won't listen to any other science because he's found something to be passionate about. That's great and all, but on the offchance that global warming is a real thing, nobody would benefit and everyone would die.


Might I remind you that the *entire human race, and all of life as a whole* is a ""fart in the wind"", so what's your point? 
If all life on earth dies, sure it might come back.
Sure, in 2500 years it won't be a problem, but it's a problem now and we're going backwards in science. Look at us, we still have people who think earth is fucking flat.

They know better then scientists.... cool. For those who really believe this shit let me tell you that banks do not care if florida or london  will be flooded. They  want theyr money back in 5, 10, 20 or 30 years, they want the interests paied and an increased number of clients. People still do not believe or understanf the urgency of the matter and if bank X will not give them a loan for a house or office in london they will find the loan with bank Y. Once climate change will show up for real and the endangered areas will suffer from the consequences of climate change, most banks will have their investements return. If i buy a house and take a loan (with no insurance on the house) and the day after there is an eartquake that destroys the house. I will still have to pay for the loan... the risk for the bank is minimum ,(especially on large numbers). They do not know...they simply do not care"

The solar minimum is this, the sun goes into a semi dormant state and space solar activity goes down a lot, for 11 years Earth would be a cold planet still habitable dropping 10¬∞F. The solar maximum is when the Earth is going into a stage where green house gases go and take over us and raise the temperature by 20¬∞F-30¬∞F still thrivable environment think of death valley the highest temperature was around 138¬∞F."

You have been indoctrinated by the mainstream media. Looking at your subscriptions you have little knowledge of politics but I'll explain this anyway.
The reason why Dan Pena knows it's a scam is because elite, Zionist Jeœâs are in control of the central banks. Through the central banks they control the minor banks. They own and control the Federal Reserve. They also own and control the mainstream media (they used the wealth from the banks to buy it up). Using big money and media they control the politicians.
Hence if the banksters are funding property near the coast, they know global warming is not happening. They use the media to indoctrinate people. 
Elite, Zionist Jeœâs have instructed on the creation of the scam to further their agenda. A summary of their agenda is in the video titled, *The Globalist Agenda Explained* ... by YouTuber RockingMrE.

Every green living plant on earth is benefiting from the increase in CO2. Atmospheric CO2 was historically & dangerously LOW before humans began using fossil fuels. If we didn't liberate the carbon trapped in the ground, green lifeforms would be in slow decline. Greenhouse grown crops thrive when enriched with 1000 ppm CO2. 
All life benefits if we continue adding to the present level of 400 ppm CO2. Science dictates burning all the fossil fuels could not raise CO2 enough to hurt anything. Human carbon emissions boost growth of every green plant on earth by almost 15 percent. CO2 = Good For Life. Good science and moral people side with the truth. 
I've been searching nature for decades, looking, but never finding the climate/sky is falling type problems all the Chicken Little types keep alarming about.

Bank loans are underwritten by insurance companies and insurance companies are gambling that we will stop global warming.  Also because it is happening slowly, ppl are building sea walls that can be extended to accommodate rising sea levels.

Here's an analogy.  Because an incoming planet killing asteroid is not man made, should you do nothing to deflect it?  If climate change is not man made, should you do nothing to deflect it?  If reducing green house gas will reduce climate change (it will) to a point where we can cope, then climate change is man made."

"1995a1995z","2018-12-22T12:19:28Z","1. Banks are not scientists. 

2. Planet earth has not existed for 13.8 billion years. We as humans have been on this planet for just less than 100,000 years. 

The earth will survive global warming for sure. But living habitats such as humans may not. This is the issue. 

3. Think about it logically, we are pumping a vast amount of carbon from deep underground into the atmosphere within a short period of time. Something that our earth has never gone through before while we have existed. This will for sure have an adverse effect on the conditions of the atmosphere. Don‚Äôt need to be genius to predict that. 

It may not be such a bad thing as some say. But do we really wanna play dice with our environment?  

4. Fossile fuels will eventually run out anyway. 

5. 99% of scientists believer global warming is a very serious issue that needs upmost attention now. 

Say you were feeling ill and you suspected that you had cancer, You went to see 100 doctors, and 99 of them said you had cancer. But only 1 said you didn‚Äôt have cancer. 

What would you go with. I‚Äôm sure you accept that you have cancer. This is exact same scenario we have with global warming."

This is because the banks are hedging bets on the time frame being exactly a 30-40 year term for their current profitability, thats why they would loan people 3 mortgages, who couldnt afford it, thats why give people credit who cant afford it. Why ask a person who clearly doesnt know or understand anything to do with climate change, and gives anecdotes about about one persons apparent flippant remarks when the questioner clearly had a purpose and intent and you decided to rally the nonsensical idea that banks wouldnt do something they do all the time which is stiff the individual. Dan pena is a joke, why do people bother to ask these clowns about climate change when they dont know anything. They always give anecdotal opinions based on cliches and misleading misunderstanding of the world and how it works, oh in my city its got colder year on year, oh banks arent underwriting contracts on investments on beachhouse property. I will tell you why they dont want you to know what does green energies give the consumer? theyre own power supply, independent of a private company, cutting out energy companies. thats what green technologies give you, how can any technology be bad for the economy? WHAT!? petrol had its day, it doesnt matter about co2, if you are smart you move to getting away from privatized energy to your own ability to make and control it.

Unfortunately big business is impacted with the Paris accord, the Montreal protocol, etc when they are signed.

The scientific community does research and provides data. The data is filtered, simplified and published to the masses. Then the public has to form an opinion.
Does the public want to pay higher taxes? No.
I have seen that being repeated many times just in this page.

I'll give a few examples:
1. As for the big businesses, they have to install filter systems to remove SO2 when they burn coal. These systems cost money but they reduce acid rain.
2. Petrol companies have to remove sulfur compounds and convert it to H2S and then convert it to solid sulfur.
(I think it was Esso that was fighting to not implement this technology. Eventually, they caved in.)

You have countries like China that don't give a damn about pollution.
So in order to compete and keep jobs in the USA, the USA wants to pretend there is no problem.

"New Wing","2018-12-13T09:36:38Z","Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.

The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.

Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth‚Äôs climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.

The global temperature increase brings disastrous consequences, endangering the survival of the Earth‚Äôs flora and fauna, including human beings. The worst climate change impacts include the melting of the ice mass at the poles, which in turn causes rising sea level, producing flooding and threatening coastal environments through which small island states risk disappearing entirely.

Climate change also increases the appearance of more violent weather phenomena, drought, fires, the death of animal and plant species, flooding from rivers and lakes, the creation of climate refugees and destruction of the food chain and economic resources, especially in developing countries."

I assure you: Either in this life or at your judgement, you will believe in the existence of God.

Lastly, what you do I do not know and the following is not a direct personal attack against you.  As stated, what you do, I do not know:

Time and time again, people who identify themselves as atheists have appeared to me to be not atheists but, rather, in rebellion.  Two main reasons for this: 1) Being hurt in a relationship(example: a child's father abandoned him at an early age); 2) the desire to continue doing a particular sin(popular sins include pornography, homosexual behavior, fornication, adultery, drug abuse, alcohol abuse).  The question is asked: Is there even one person on the face of the earth who identifies himself as an atheist who is not engaging in at least one of these sins?"
"max bootstrap","2019-02-01T01:42:15Z","@Channel421 : No.  However, if I was right there watching and *POOF* in an instant the metal leg turned into a warm functional human leg full of bones and muscles appeared while I was watching (and I was able to touch before and after to make sure it was not just a fancy visual effect)... then I would be fairly convinced that something very extraordinary happened... which I would very much want to investigate and come to understand.

Let's be clear.  If an alien race (or some secret company funded by Bezos or Musk) was to create some kind of StarTrek like ""transporter"" capable of transporting a human leg from one person somewhere else to this person right in front of me... that would be very extraordinary.  However, *it would not prove that some super-duper-hyper-creature created the universe and was literally omniscient and omnipotent.*

You see, if you want me to believe *X* then you need to provide evidence of *X* ... not something else (no matter how impressive that might be).  I don't even know how in principle you could prove to me that some super-duper-hyper-creature created the universe.  Maybe if they went to the observatory with me and asked me to chose any of the hundreds of billions of galaxies out there... and I did... and he made that galaxy instantly and permanently turn into a galaxy-size pumpkin pie or something else equally absurd (for all telescopes in the world to see)... well... at least he would get me to entertain the possibility of an omniscient, omnipotent being.  But knowing me, I'd want more than that, because maybe some super-duper advanced alien technology might be able to create such a visual effect, even for everyone from every point of view on earth.  But at least that would get me to start such an investigation and take that possibility seriously."
"Channel421","2019-02-01T01:18:07Z","max bootstrap: If you saw a miraculous happening take place after a Christian had appealed to God, would you believe, then, that God exists?  (Example: Someone prayed aloud(as a Christian would pray) and asked that a person with an amputated leg have two legs again and, upon completion of the prayer, the person who was missing one leg now had two legs.)"
"max bootstrap","2019-02-01T00:22:07Z","@Channel421 : If *NO* ""omniscient, omnipotent being ('god') who created the universe"" exists... that is sufficient for me to say ""Christianity is false"".  I could come at the question from many other angles too, but why bother.  If the central requirement of Christianity (namely that super-duper-hyper-infinity-being) is simply made up or a fantasy or wishful thinking or elitist propaganda designed to control humans... then whatever remains of Christianity (and every other religion) is based on a fundamental falsehood.  Don't you agree?

PS:  Various religious texts, including the various bibles, contain descriptions of a great many historical people, places and events of ages past.  Without a doubt some or many of those people, places and events did exist, even if some of the details given are wrong (and others are correct).  To me, the fact that some statements like that are correct does not mean ""Christianity is correct"".  All sorts of total lies, nonsense and propaganda contains some true and factual statements.

I'll give you another way to look at this.  As far as I can tell, I understand the nature of advanced (human+) consciousness better than any other human on the planet.  I have learned to identify which concepts are fiction and which are not (at least most of common concepts).  One concept that is definitely *fiction* ... and actually *inherent fiction* ... is ""authority"".  No human can be have or gain ""authority"" over any other human being.  Hence, ""authority"" is an utterly bogus concept.  Since all ""government"" and all ""religion"" (that I've ever heard of) requires ""authority"" to exist or have any significance, this fact also means ""religion is false""... as well as ""government is false"" if you want to extend the significance of this realization."

This shows that your scientific literacy skills is lacking. When you wan to analyze if a claim is correct, it is important to check the credibility and research on the background of your sources. Youtube is a bad place to look for evidence. 

I have found numerous problem with your sources.
(1) Richard Muller has long ago corrected himself after doing his own research on climate change and now believe that climate change is real --> Here is his interview with New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html. You can find five of the scientific papers that he published showing that climate change is real -->http://berkeleyearth.org/
(2) Looking at the background of this Lord Christopher Monckton, he is not a scientist. He has done zero study or research on climate change. He did not provide any evidence that would contradict the findings of the scientific community. Just because there is a Lord infront of his name does not make him a credible source on everything. 
(3) Ivar Giaever, sure he may be a nobel laureate but listening to Giaever's opinions on climate science is equivalent to giving your dentist a pamphlet on heart surgery and asking him to crack your chest open. Both are doctors but each specialize in different areas.  HE IS A PHYSICIST. NOT A CLIMATE SCIENTIST. This link basically debunk whatever this nobel laureate have said about climate change. https://www.skepticalscience.com/ivar-giaever-nobel-physicist-climate-pseudoscientist.html
(4)John Coleman is a fucking TV weatherman. lack credentials. published 0 peer reviewed scientific paper on climate change so why would you even used him as your ""evidence""

Basically, you quoted zero expert in your argument and who the fuck cares about AL GORE. THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVES AROUND FUCKING USA THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SCIENTIST AROUND THE FUCKING WORLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATE WHICH HAS PUBLISHED NUMEROUS FUCKING PEER REVIEWED PAPER THAT SHOWS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE. i give zero fuck to al gore but I will take the findings of the thousands of scientist all over the world seriously."

Why do you think they changed the name from Global Warming to Climate Change.  The Global Warming and everyone of their dire predictions failed to come true.  Not even close.  They know that the term ""Climate Change"" offers them an excuse because the climate does change all of the time.

We haven't been on this planet for 13 billion years, but that incredibly ignorant comment can go aside. Though the incredible age of our planet actually helps to defeat his argument, so thanks to him for his ignorance. Of course there have been cyclic climate changes over the lifetime of the planet but we weren't around to endure them and the cycles have frequencies in the order of millennia. For the time we've been here we haven't produced quantities of CO2 large enough to effect the climate until the industrial revolution. The undeniable proof shows that we've caused climate change in the period since the industrial revolution particularly since the 1970's when it reached the temperature-impacting threshold and the greenhouse effect really started making things change."

With them the oceans the earth would be much warmer than it is already. When we reach that tipping point and the oceans, which absorb a bulk of the Earths CO2 cannot absorb anymore, it will almost certainly spell the end of all plant and animal life. I find it really sad on here, the commentary, people making fun of each other, like winning a conversation is the most important thing. Im the opposite, I hope Im wrong, I hope all this data and stark warnings are bullshit. I would love nothing more for all the skeptics on here to be right. They can 'win' the conversation, I don't care about that. I think of it like this: scientists say were in danger of extinction of all life due to rapid climate change, its happened several times before. skeptics say there is no danger. It can get confusing, but there are really only 4 options. The scientists are right, or the skeptics are right, and we do something, or we do nothing.

"H Macy","2019-01-06T17:17:48Z","@Captain America Its called carbon dating ice core samples. They go back millions of years.  Its how we know when the ice ages happened, what compounds were in the atmosphere at the time, and their concentrations. Besides, whatever happens in your particular part of the world over the 22 years of a 4.5 billion year old planet is fairly irrelevant to the timescale that climate change normally occurs. Thermometers don't lie, globally the Earth is getting warmer, including winters. A warmer planet means higher humidity and more snow in certain parts of the world, so winters may feel more severe or extreme."
"H Macy","2018-12-03T22:57:27Z","@tanmoy313 Yes, and a president who doesn't even know the difference between weather and climate certainly isn't helping. It can be confusing. Depending on where in the world you live warming might well bring increased humidity and more rain. Some people might see rain as a sign the world isn't getting warmer, but thats just not scientifically accurate at all. As the air warms glaciers and lakes lose mass to evaporation, putting more moisture into the atmosphere, and thus more rain. And depending on whether its an El Nino or El Nina year severe winters will become more common because more moisture will also mean more snow in winter. Again people will see a harsh winter as a sign climate change isn't happening. Eventually though once the ice has melted from the poles and glaciers it will completely change again and the Earth will go from the ideal conditions for life, to a period of very warm and humid conditions, and finally hot and dry as the oceans will literally boil off. This happens naturally over billions of years, the real questions is what does throwing all human activity into the mix do to the equation? If we could stop Earth from becoming Venus wouldn't we want to at least try? And the crazy thing is we have the technology, people are just lost. Lost in social media, living in this ridiculous make believe world of 'likes', and who has more ""friends"" while the very planet on which we live is in danger of becoming unliveable.  Strange energy in the air these days, lots of folks saying the same thing. People who are tuned in can feel we are at a great crossroads right now."

I learnt a couple of things back then too. One thing that stuck was that warmer weather will lead to more frequent severe weather incidents around the year i.e. more tornadoes, cyclones, blizzards, etc. 
Sure enough you got jackasses on fox news going - hyuk hyuk... look at all the snowstorms... and they think we have global warming. 
And now we have conservatives, who at this point in history have so lost touch with reality that they qualify as a cult, are almost all adamant that there is no global warming.

All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.

But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.

His main argument is that financial economics are the truth, i.e. ""look no further: it isn't in the contract, so it must not be true""  Unfortunately for us, financial success is misguidedly, the king and total truth of humanity.  So much is missed out on, humanity needs a bevy of drivers that all work in concert to decide ""success"""

"Joshua Jonah","2018-10-26T18:31:14Z","Ahh, yes. The climate change tax scam long-con. It dates back to its inception in the 1800s based off when scientists discovered that some gasses absorb and reflect infrared radiation and Fourier's calculation that Earth would be far colder without an atmosphere. In 1896, the con was invented by Arrhenius' first model/calculation of global warming with the hope that some day governments would tax the citizenry and end the evil destructive forces of industrialization and capitalism.
It took over a century of research, measurements, observations, technological innovation, and public and backroom pandering, but those crafty devious scientists have finally managed to win over the dumb, corrupt politicians to impose a relatively minor tax. It's all finally coming together. Thank God we have figureheads like Ford and Trump that are smart and courageous enough to fight against the malicious machinations of Arrhenius to save us from the evils of an equivalent 1.3% increase of government revenue/taxes."

"xHappySnowmanx","2018-10-22T05:55:50Z","Exploring Human Impact On Climate Evolution

There is clear motivation to continue society's use of fossil fuels. They are the most readily commoditized of  all available fuel sources. The energy density packed into hydrocarbon molecules fueled the advance of industrial age, to which we are all indebted. The relatively few channels through which we can access these fuels has created tremendous ability to shape all aspects of any market, be it free or highly regulated OR DICTATED.
        What then, motivates the alleged scientific gathering of data to suggest that while the earth's climate is in regular flux, our use of natural resources has caused some kind of ""unnatural"" climate shift? We are nature, we are g-d. The earth is our gift to cherish or exploit as we see fit. And so, I personally conclude that most scientific explorations pertaining to the subject of climate chance are genuine efforts to help ensure a habitable earth for future generations.
       Everyone is wrong at some point and to some degree. The arguments against the potential for climate change seem to rely on meaningless, contrived comparisons and general dismissal. If scientists simply dismissed these rebuttals to their hypotheses we would not have any reason to take this matter seriously. The continuing and transparent work of science to strengthen its claims encourages the ongoing debate by adding new information to the pool of consideration. The FACTS are though, that whether or not fossil fuels exacerbate climate evolution, they take an enormous toll on the ecosystems that they come into contact with by changing the chemistry and topography of water and land more quickly than most life can adapt. Not to mention, the recovery of naturally sequestered hydrocarbons is the leading cause for land disputes among individuals, communities, and even governments.
       The extreme  defensive posture assumed by hydrocarbon fanatics eludes to the coordinated effort from the hydrocarbon industry to protect their market share. The campaign to discredit potential dangers of hydrocarbon exploitation dates back almost to the birth of the industry. Fossil fuel necessity is then, quite naturally reinforced by our current dependence on fossil fuels to maintain our modern lifestyle.  
          WE ARE MASTERS OF THIS EARTH. THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM OUR EXPLORING SOMETHING ''NEW''. No reasonable person expects hydrocarbons to immediately, or ever, become outlawed. There will likely always be sectors that rely on mined hydrocarbons for a variety of reasons. What is being suggested (by rational scientists) is that we as a species would very likely find it to be in our collective interest to diversify our energy portfolio to include systems that reduce the need for energy as they increase our ability to produce it anywhere, by individuals and municipalities alike. 
           I hope that really struck a nerve with everyone on both sides of this debate. It boils down to a dramatic shift in the balance of ""power"". Power to sustain, to produce, and to govern. That is why the hydrocarbon side of this debate is so acutely organized in their methods of planting doubt, by mis-aligning comparisons to reinforce any ideologies they deem beneficial to maintaining their market dominance. The balance of power is literally at stake. 
           Please remember, I think we are all as good as we can be, doing what we think will ensure a bright future. The only people who would demonize  each other for adhering to their respective beliefs cannot envision change and are looking to shore up the flimsy ground they themselves stand on. No one is bad for benefiting from/enjoying our current hydrocarbon exploitation, but to shirk responsibly for ensuring a productive earth for as long as possible is in my opinion inexcusable. Everyone is as much a part of the perceived problem as they are the perceived solution. Who wants tea?
             Best advice ever, because I like you, there is more to gain from an unbiased understanding of world history than a subjective interpretation of current events."

Just because you say something is a fact doesnt make it so and that goes for my comments as well. There is plenty of evidance that show opposite findings. Also there is propoganda being pushed in the press regarding climate change (and everything else for that matter). I hope you can see that. Look into Agenda 21. Global regulation that will take away individual liberties and rights. We are not being told the entire story. Hey I care about the enviornment and the planet as much if not more than you or anyone else but I want the facts but when I see something like Agenda 21 and the deception taking place in the news I know that there is something bigger than global warming going on. Lastly climate change is of course real and we are for sure having an impact on our world but the impact on the planet is not clear from what I have read and seen. You can go ahead and say that there are thousands of scientist who would disagree and that is true but what you may not know is that some of those scientist have sued to have their name taken off of the reports of climate change because they were hired to investigate and give their findings. Even though they disagreed their names were still put on the official findings report. So the actual number of scientist who gave reports that support the propagandist narrative of human made climate change is not  accurate and is inflated for sure. Im still reseaching this subject so hopefully I can more accurately give my points in the future."

CO2 captures infrared wavelenghts from the sun rays as they attempt to exit the Earth. Energy thus gets trapped in the lower atmosphere. We emit more into the atmosphere than nature can take back in, so we are warming the planet. This will eventually cause many expensive disasters. That's the scientific consensus in a nutshell."

"Ayaaz Ahmed","2018-10-05T16:04:09Z","Man the arguments here hurt my brain... Lets go over it...
Many people claim the rising water levels is a lie, in reality even the 'anti climate change' smart people agree that the water levels are rising and the thing they are arguing is the fact that this rise in water levels is attributed to a man made phenomenon. 100% completely verified fact=water levels rising. Anecdotes and little stories like 'i am 160 years old and i never seen the water levels rise' isnt a very reliable argument against something as fundamental and easy to measure as water level rising by actual scientists. There is literally no debate there.

Another top comment is warming and cooling of planet is cyclic. No one has ever disputed this fact(which it is) but the reason why most CLIMATE scientists are freaking out is because it is happening quicker than what it would normally be. Eventually CO2 levels will return to the ridiculously high levels as it has several times but the purpose of curbing pollution is to delay this from happening as much as possible. 

Thirdly everyone talks about how the temperature in their flipping bathrooms havent changed so climate change is a lie? Like I said before anecdotes about your tiny area and what you personally think are all nonsensical and I highly doubt this person has done any research into the facts. I remember someone stating that the temperature is still the same for a certain country he lives in like it was a fact, but after only 30 minutes of research I could disprove that 'fact'. You people need to look at the data.

"Carson","2018-09-29T04:44:29Z","For people who don't believe in climate change and genuinely want to learn more about it:
Climate change is real, the measurements are accurate, the theory is extensively peer-reviewed, and it is caused by humans.
People often say that CO2 levels ebb and flow throughout geologic time, which is true. However, they normally change between a range of 275 and 250 ppm (parts per million). The last time CO2 was above 300 ppm in the atmosphere was approximately 34 million years ago. You could say this is just a normal ebb and flow, but this event was due to intense volcanism and took tens of millions of years to achieve. Currently, there is about 410 ppm of C02 in the atmosphere, about 1.5x the normal amount. This seems like not a lot, but any change in CO2 levels can have massive impacts on the environment. Not to mention, this change occurred in a poultry 250 years, which is far, far shorter than the millions of years it took for the last dramatic increase in CO2 levels. This amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is completely unprecedented before humans became dominant, and the increase began right as the industrial revolution took place. While CO2 levels are cyclical, they shift at an incredibly slow rate, giving organisms a chance to adapt to the warmer and cooler temperatures. At this point, with all of the obvious correlations and peer-reviewed studies, denying climate change is like denying the force of gravity or the existence of the moon."

"nibblebaby","2018-09-11T04:04:15Z","It is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on mankind.  Here is why....

All it is in a nutshell is a money making scam to use your emotions to feel like you are fighting a just cause.  There is no way to measure how your donations are helping this cause.  If they would use a real environmental issue, they would say we need to clean the plastics in our oceans.  That is doing much worse to our environment than mankind releasing CO2 which the Earth knows how to regulate.  If they really cared about the environment, then they would focus their attention on the plastics in the ocean.  Then those donating could see if they were really making a difference by the levels of plastics in the oceans.  Well, you can't pull of a scam if results are to be expected.

CO2 makes up less than 1% of the gases in our atmosphere.  We release so little that it is a drop of water in the vast ocean.  The Earth traps excess CO2 in the ocean and has a very effective way to filter it to maintain stability.  

The ozone layer has increased since the 80s, so they can no longer use that threat against us.  Another ice age is coming, cried in the 70s, well that turned out to be false.  Man made global warming, well now you notice they stopped using that phrase since it ahs been proven that the Earth does indeed warm and cool on a natural cycle.  So now, the new cry is climate change, yes the climate changes all the time, always has and always will.

So if Al Gore and his ilk really cared about CO2 gases being released by man, why do they use private jets, how much do they really do to minimize their carbon footprint?  Lets tax countries that use CO2 and get rich from them.  Lets show pictures of polar bears struggling in the melting polar caps.  That will get the people to send money to us.  Only one problem, every year the polar caps melt and refreeze.  They only show the spring and summer thaw.  Imagine this, ice melting after receiving up to 24 hours of sunlight.  Then refreezing when the sunlight decreases.  Polar bears are actually over populated and they are adapted to feast like a king when food sources are high and use their fat reserves when the food sources are low."

"Justin Pyle","2018-08-24T15:46:03Z","the issue is the exascerbated time frame is within a few human generations. and yes, it will correct itself, the issue is people are now too stupid to cope with it. sure ice caps are melting and we have acid rain, doesnt mean ocean levels have to rise. evaporation is also a continuous factor reducing the amount of water in the ocean. if solar energies are higher, AND ambient temperatures are higher, evaporation happens more readily. the problem was never really ocean levels rising. the problem is disruption of the ocean currents and the cooling of the oceans, which reduces the O2 content as the water becomes more dense. this pushes more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere which insulate it and cause the atmosphere to refract more and more light from direct path to the surface, cooling it more. the caps will be melting and freezing in new places because this will not happen the same pace everywhere. we will have time to migrate, if you are intelligent."
"Keith Watson","2018-08-24T14:57:33Z","Poem: If only I could turn back the time
By Keith Watson

Reflecting on your past, what would you change to make it better?
You could send someone the right information in a letter
Many things I would change, knowing the outcome, just change the words you have said
Changing the course of things doing different things instead

Knowing the outcome of the game, save us the toll of life, lifting heavy lumber 
Just one day back in time may make the difference, a winning lottery number
Time to change the mistakes you made, no need to look back in anger
If only we could, the world should be loved much more, to keep us safe for longer

To tell people about the future, to warn the world
Before it starts and gets out of hand before it‚Äô begins
With all the trouble in the world, with the mess and lack of education,

A throwaway society we have become, the fact remains
Messing about with technologies, the creation of power invented in Science
Like nuclear energy, pushed as mitigation rapidly building Pandora Box in defiance

Global methane and release = HAARP technology may course violence cataclysm
When the World was first born, great violence with destruction, a catastrophic geological phenomenon 
Imploring my fellow man to build a better future if I can
Without such powers of great construction

Turning back the clock, to make new of the soil of nature
To grow in strength shedding the seeds of life again in recognition
God sends his love in mysterious ways, fresh droplets, ‚Äúdrink all that you can‚Äù

The storm clouds sending, down comes to the rain. 
If only I could turn back time, allowing nature and hope to continue on
For life still growing and showing that humanity should start again.

He alone shall save us?

The ""noise"" perturbations in the data often last several centuries and represent rapid rise and fall of global temperatures. The sampling rate that has been used to defend the premise that there is a Human impact is woefully insignificant. To make any reasonable projections, one must consider data that goes back many thousands of years, not just to the 19th Century, AD.

And despite the repeated assertions of the climate alarmists, MOST knowledgeable, qualified scientists do NOT agree with the anthropogenic climate change hypothesis."

I live in Western Canada and our climate has changed a lot in my 50 years. Now I personally cant prove why, all I know is in the past decade we have seen a massive rise in forest fires and particularly their intensity. We now know that pine beetles which moved north as our winters have warmed, are contributing to this by killing the trees so they dry out making them extremely combustible. So now for about 3 weeks every summer our clean Canadian air is filled with thick smoke. We had air quality worse than Beijing for a while. Rather than sound the alarm the media, here and in the US, just calls it the new normal. It keeps getting worse each year so if this is the new normal we should be expecting apocalyptic fire seasons lasting 3-4 months in the near future. Remember the Ozone Hole in the 70's? Man made CFC's were proven to be the culprit and the entire planet banded together to ban CFC's. Now 40's years later the hole has been closing ever since. The ozone layer protects us from the suns ultraviolet radiation, without it most life would be dead in a matter of days. It is probably the most scientifically documented example of how we changed the makeup of our stratosphere not once but twice, the second time for good when we banned CFC's. Look around you, the oceans are full of garbage, think of how massive they are. How can you really think we could not do something like affect the climate? And why do have so much anger, at your age especially, towards a movement that is just trying to do a good thing and protect our childrens right to a future with clean air and water? Im curious, what is it that you, personally, have to lose that makes you so hostile toward this? Electric motors are just better, thats why we don't have gas engines strapped to our TVs, Toasters and Hair Dryers. The shortfall is on the storage side, but this is not the fault of the electric motor, and batteries are getting better and better every year. The future is electric, and in the next 5 years we are told we will have emission free fusion, which along with hydrogen and renewable energy where applicable, will be our future sources of power generation.Times change man, now is the time of electrification. I don't recall a revolution by the makers of the steam engine when the internal combustion engine came along."

With that said, why would you want to be told at the last minute when it's too late?  If that's how you think, why not be consistent with your logic like so...

Like,
Let you know the moment a tornado hits your house instead of listening to the meteorologists and storm chasers ahead of time?
Stop your car the moment you're going over a cliff instead of hitting your brakes well before?
Tell you that you have heart disease instead of eating healthy and exercising now?
Tell you you're broke when you retire instead of investing in your 401k now?
Tell you the moment your city floods from a hurricane instead of evacuating days before?

Is that line of thinking really the reasonable way to approach problems or are you just being stubborn right now? Why not listen to what the scientists are telling you so we don't have to face dire consequences later? Wouldn't that be the smart decision to make? 

Also, while you've been waiting the last 20 years (probably doing nothing I assume), the Earth has gotten warmer, the carbon in the atmosphere has gotten worse (ppm) and the oceans have risen (approx 3.2 mm per year), Coral Reefs have gotten bleached, animals have died or migrated, all while people are breathing in this toxic air pollution and probably further increasing cancer rates, yet you want to sit around and do nothing and contribute to the problem? Help me understand why you think that way. Why?

"NAYKD POET","2018-08-17T14:02:00Z","The basic premise to  Dan Pena's position: if climate change/global warming were affecting sea level, Banks would not be investing in coastal real estate by way of lending in the form of mortgages. Implying; they know better that their investments are not in jeopardy of disappearing due to sea level rise in the next few decades. Unfortunately, given the experience of the 2008 financial crash, Pena's assertion that big Banks have foresight and critical assessment of future events measured by their willingness to invest securely within an investment sector, is rather more than weak. Bank CEO's and Board members are generally those with MBA's, and their picture outlook, more often than not, is short-term, not exceeding five years. They could care less to what happens ten, fifteen, forty years hence. They will have made their personal wealth, be long gone, and the problem will be the poor fool who has the misfortune of being head of the Bank when their investments are literally UNDER FUCKING WATER! Pena too will be long dead, so why would he give a rat's ass to what the affects will be twenty years from now! The women's concerns are real: whether warranted, only time will tell!"

He presents it without bias & is a very humble, scientific man. He backs up data manipulation extremely well. Best presentation I've seen.

Every time he presents incontrovertible facts, the Senate committee members openly ignore the data  (lots of charts for visual understanding) & sheepishly grin in defiance. They don't try to understand the data. Their BIAS is clearly apparent. They just ignore the data. 

Why? Global Warming is a huge HUGE $$ maker - world wide! Government funding (our taxes) going out & $$ to gov't officials coming in. The Main Stream Media refuses to report the facts as well. They're in on the deception too. Follow the $. Follow the money...

These are both unfounded assertions. What we DO know without a shred of doubt, is that 1) atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing, 2) Global Accumulated Cyclonic Energy (ACE) averaged over the last 20 years is below longer term historic averages 3) the planet is 13% greener since 1980 according to multiple peer reviewed studies utilizing AVHRR satellite data, 4) Global food grain harvests have set multiple records in this decade, and most of that food is grown outdoors, on a planet which is supposedly succumbing to increased CO2. 5) We are feeding a greater percentage of the world's population than at any time in the last 100 years and 6)Global average life expectancies continue to rise this decade. If the human race had asked the question 120 years ago 'can ceaseless growth and expansion be possible without consequences' ,'NO' was the conclusion and we allowed groundless fear to possess us, 55 year life expectancies would still be the norm here in North America because we'd have not a single modern convenience, and not a single modern petroleum derived medicine or process.

Now the earth maybe resilient enough to bounce back but not if mans effect continues to increase.
It may resemble past periods but it has been for thos cause and there is no information on how the earth will recover if it does.

His view is symbolic of greedy white capitalists who think that ceaseless growth and expansion is possible without consequence. They are not concerned with ecology or animal life or shrinking hunting grounds for native peoples and species....to them those things dont matter.

Let alone they admit using telemetrics augmented reality to blend realtime video with augmented video to fake the manipulation of virtual objects. Or how they use fish eye lenses to fake the globes curve. Or how all full images of earth, satellites, and planets ect are admitted cgi fake, just to name a few scams they swindle the sheep with. The plethora of things that our government has tested are mostly supressed from trending. Like Dick cheney pointed out once in an interview that they have  technology that can destroy specific race of people by targeting a specific genome of that particular race. The things that potentially go on all around us, are more than most sheep can handle. Thats just 101 entry level stuff. Just ask yourselves, whens the last time the media has enlightened anyone on elementary suppressed information with even reasonable coverage? Like free energy devices, evil DNA MANIPULATORS, EVIL DNA PRINTERS, OR aborted babies sent to labs for testing for the next new drug that doesnt cure anything in my opinion by purposeful design, and potentially has more side affects than it does good. Or the millions and millions that go missing into sex trafficking and never dramatically & visually covered in mainstream. Or the Blackmail traps that entrap more and more people including governmental officials, media, celebrities ect. Which keeps them from coming forward to expose the truth or they are potentially harrassed, threatened, attacked, or murdered. Or how our government spies on all of us but mandates non disclosure forms so to keep whistle-blowers afraid to speakout even if its exposing criminal offenses.  The criminals are keeping themselves free and clear  by implementing internal unconstitutional laws and policies to scare whistle blowers & avoid exposures of all their own wrong doings. Also they are given top secret clearances to access spy applications to see exactly who may expose their crimes. And under Obama they have deliberately granted access and sharing of this spy data to multiple agencies in our government so now it's even harder to tell who we can trust.  Say what? If that's not grounds for complicity in nealry every aspect of our lives. Then you sheep are spending way to much time grazing the endless fields of entertainment the elites have enticed you with so you stay busy & don't look behind the curtains of what is really going on around you all.

Where Does the Carbon Dioxide Really Come From?



Professor Ian Plimer's book in a brief summary. 



PLIMER: ""Okay, here's the bombshell. The volcanic eruption in Iceland . Since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS, NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.



Of course, you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying to suppress - it‚Äôs that vital chemical compound that every plant requires to live and grow and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans and all animal life.



I know....it's very disheartening to realize that all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your kids ""The Green Revolution"" science project, throwing out all of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and speedboat, vacationing at home instead of abroad,nearly getting hit every day on your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs with $10.00 light bulbs.....well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days.



The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth's atmosphere in just four days - yes, FOUR DAYS - by that volcano in Iceland has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.



I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should mention that when the volcano Mt Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth.



Yes, folks, Mt Pinatubo was active for over One year - think about it.



Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect climate change.



And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years. And it happens every year.



Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus 'human-caused' climate-change scenario.



Hey, isn‚Äôt it interesting how they don‚Äôt mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just 'Climate Change' - you know why?



It‚Äôs because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century and these global warming bullshitartists got caught with their pants down.



And, just keep in mind that you might yet have an Emissions Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer.



It won‚Äôt stop any volcanoes from erupting, that‚Äôs for sure.



But, hey, .....go give the world a hug and have a nice day."

When was the last ice-age?
We are still living in the last remnants of it; we are observing the last of the ice melting away.

The only reason Humanity is sounding off about the possibility of rising water, the annihilation of so much of this land based species, is because Humanity thinks it has 'rights'.
It believes it has the 'right' to exist, above all others; it does not have any such 'right'.

The possibility exists that this is the beginning of the next, evolutionary, stage of this planet; the stage where only those that can tolerate the approaching conditions are those destined to survive.

This planet, 'Mother Nature', will tolerate imbalance as long as it can, or wants to, before it wipes the slate clean, in a moment, whatever the species, and begins again.

It would appear, after the industrial onslaught of the last two/three hundred years that the next clean-up could be Humanity.
The bad news is that you have less right to live than the bug you just stepped on just because you don't like bugs; it was just being what it is...a bug.

Humanity is just a 'bug' to this planet and it is beginning to show signs that it doesn't like this particular type of bug.
Humanity is very close to getting stepped on."

All the living, aminals, plants, wind, water, bioms, mountains, everything you can image on Earth is a huge system, and this type of climate change affects it all. If one part of the system is affected by a critically unnatural change, the whole system will suffer and can collapse. It may revive after thousands of years, but obviously we dont want it to be collapsed at all, because that would mean the end of humanity. And in best case scenario, even if its a hoax or even if it goes the natural way, it doesnt mean that humanity will survive this tendency in rise of temperature. And by the way, answering the woman's question by using reasons from the business world is just plain retarded. First of all, those cash cows are fucking stupid if it comes to biology related topic, second, their interest is to present global warming as a hoax, they wanna keep their position and wealth.

2. The argument that the financial world does not accomodate for climate change as a real thing isn't a scientific argument. If you loose your property (or loose value on the house) due to rising sea water YOU are the one who is in trouble, NOT the bank. They will sure make you pay your mortgage, and if you wanna sell the house, you will end up with a lot of debt! The mortgage sector has no scrupules about lending risky money, as proven by the housing and banking crisis!!

Note: I'm sure that people in Kiribati (who are experiencing already rising sea water levels) already have difficulties in financing real estate on their island.... And they probably won't find an investor that wants to finance them the costs for building a sea dike, so they will probably have to migrate to some place else in the next decades.

"Someone Somewhere","2018-08-01T13:11:38Z","Global Warming is real and science isn't even arguing about that anymore so stop saying it's a fraud. It's proven. 11 of the hottest years in the entire history of the earth have been this century, you can see that by examining bubbles of air trapped in the ice at the poles (which are also melting more than growing more and more with every year, yes they always melted and grew but now they melt more and don't grow back completely, there are many time lapses and photos of it, I don't remember the photographers name sadly but it was a difficult project). The older the ice, the older the air and thousands of years ago the amount of carbon dioxide did change a bit, going up and down, but now we added maybe just a bit but it changes a lot anyway, still causing higher temperatures. But worse than that, more hurricanes, weather becomes overall more extreme and it's right in front of us. How can you be so blind and ignorant? I'm sorry to say this and no offense against you as a person but as a part of humanity you're doing horrible. You won't even acknowledge that nature is a gigantic machine that we're part of and changing just one part of it can cause a lot of problems and damage, simple Butterfly effect, why is it so hard to understand, see for yourself and accept? 
And even if we stop producing more green house gases now, we have to go in minus to undo the damage we've done probably and it's all taking time in which many hurricanes and many hot summers are going to kill thousands if not millions of people. I'm not a nature freak or anything but we've attacked nature and it's paying back. It's like punching a kid and later denying it has a bruise when it's right in front of you.

The founder of Greenpeace and the founder of the Weather Channel, both scientists, say it is the biggest scam ever. But the most conclusive evidence; anything Obama says, the opposite is nearly always proven true, e.g., Rose Garden reception for who he said was a hero, ended up court martialed for desertion; You can't keep your plan and you doctor, premiums did not go down, but went up by a lot, he said Trump would never be president.

Is it so hard to believe that melting the one place that controls the weather of the entire planet might not be a good idea. Different elements and compounds behave differently, they heat up, retain heat and lose heat at different rates. If you pump methane and carbon into our very thin layer of atmosphere your going to change it and when you change it, naturally it will behave differently.

"Frank DiMeglio","2018-07-31T00:48:34Z","CLEAR THEORETICAL AND OBSERVATIONAL PROOF OF BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL SPACE:

Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy and linked AND BALANCED IN AND OUT of SPACE AND TIME, AS  ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

Outer ""space"" involves full inertia, AND it is fully invisible AND black. ""It"" does NOT (and it cannot) curve. ""It"" is not SPACE.

It is a very great truth that the self represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience. It is essential to BALANCE being AND EXPERIENCE. Touch AND feeling BLEND, as gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The ultimate unification of physics/physical experience combines, balances, and includes opposites. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of THE SUN (as a POINT, of course), as the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the SPEED OF LIGHT. E=mc2 AND F=ma BOTH apply to and describe THE SUN. Consider the FULLY VISIBLE Earth/ground. The electrons AND THE PHOTONS are structureless. The semi-spherical, TRANSLUCENT, BLUE sky is a QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL averaging in RELATION to what is the Earth/ground. ""Mass""/energy is gravity. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. SO, notice that the DOME of the EYE is ALSO visible. THE EYE IS THE BODY. SO, notice the black space of the EYE. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents AND INVOLVES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The BALANCE of being AND EXPERIENCE is essential. Thoughts are invisible. The ability of THOUGHT to DESCRIBE OR RECONFIGURE sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which thought is SIMILAR to sensory experience. Invisible AND visible SPACE in FUNDAMENTAL equilibrium AND BALANCE necessarily IS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE consistent with/as what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. SO, HALF of the Earth/ground DOES REMAIN constantly illuminated. Only HALF of any given sphere MAY BE visible. NOW, the EYE IS in a seamless BALANCE AS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. The Earth may ALSO appear BLUE, AND the moon may ALSO appear AS BLUE. SO, the ORANGE, SETTING, AND FLAT SUN and the fully brightened (and SETTING) moon are both necessarily the SAME SIZE as the EYE/BODY; as the BALANCE of being AND EXPERIENCE is EXTENSIVELY then demonstrated. The ORANGE SUN, the BLUE sky, AND the Moon are linked AND BALANCED to/with the Earth/ground as what is FUNDAMENTALLY BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL SPACE. Great. So, consider what is LAVA as a BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE manifestation in RELATION TO/AS the Earth/ground. The curvature or shape of the Moon DOES MATCH that of the Earth/ground (given a clear horizon, of course), AND the COMPOSITION of lunar rocks IS practically IDENTICAL to that of Earth rocks. ""Mass""/energy are linked AND BALANCED, AS gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ""Mass""/energy IS gravity. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This NECESSARILY REPRESENTS AND INVOLVES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2.

Einstein rings are demonstrative of the relationship between stars together AND stars as POINTS (ON BALANCE). In other words, they can be understood as a one dimensional SPACE that is FUNDAMENTALLY BALANCED in relation to POINTS and two dimensional SPACE. The FULLY VISIBLE Earth/ground may be held to be two dimensional, AND the stars AND planets are POINTS in the night. The Einstein rings are BALANCED ONE DIMENSIONAL (MIDDLE) manifestations or forms that PROVE that/how ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

In regard  to the 90%. It's  supposedly  97% , so you even have that wrong. Notwithstanding that number is specious  at best. Listen and learn. 10,257 members of the American Geophysical Union were surveyed out of a 60,000 membership. Of that number 3,146 responded. Of that number many were discounted  for various  reasons leaving  79 as the final group. Of that group 77 said they thought  climate change was man made   2 (well respected  and widely  published ) disagreed.  Their colleagues did not act like you do, they just disagreed 
The fraction 77/79 is where the 97%  was derived. Since that time computer models have fallen way short of the original predictions and skepticism  hardly makes someone  stupid.

The fact that Agw or Anthrogenic Global Warming or Man-Made Global Warming is a hoax. They used to call it simply Manmade Global Warming , now they are calling it Manmade Climate Change , they keep on changing the name of the hoax they are perpetuating to keep people interested and trusting of this hoax. I don't want to go into a long rant about the various evidence that disproves Agw but one of them is simply asking the question...do the people promoting this theory of Agw have anything to gain from telling you this lie? And when I refer to people, I am talking about the rich and powerful people who are selling you Agw like Al Gore and the various ""scientists"" like Bill Nye, that are promoting this theory. 


>The answer to that question is a resounding yes because the government and big corporations know that if the general public believes in the hoax of global warming, or whatever you like to call it, they can make huge profits off it. Heard of carbon taxes anyone? Yeah they will just use the bs excuse that ""co 2 emissions from cars are warming up the atmosphere, so we ,,, the government,,, must put a tax in your co 2 emissions to protect the environment"""" to tax and over regulate our society which is already being over taxed and over regulated by pointless taxes and laws. The politicians get even more fifthy rich from taxing you off a complete lie. The middle class, who can't afford electric cars, solar panels and wind turbines and other ""green "" energy tech, will be forced to use other carbon-emitting technology , and be forced to pay the carbon and various other taxes created by the Agw hoax. The rich people who own the big corporations benefit from the sales of their new ""environmentally friendly"" green tech (which is actually destructive to the environment by the way), and the big fossil fuel companies don't have to pay extra taxes for the carbon they emit because you know? The rich always find new and ingenious ways to having to pay less taxes. And the tax burden is always given to the middle class.

Then he follows it up with ""the 13.8 billion years we've been on this miserable planet"", first, Earth is a beautiful planet.   Second, it's 4.5 billion years old, not 13.8 billion years old.

If Dan Pena and his followers would like to ignore these facts, then i can only think that they do it because they are mad.

"Ted Rees","2018-07-26T08:04:32Z","Over a hundred years of using fossil fuels has resulted in an enormous amount of excess CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans. CO2 does not go away quickly naturally, it takes tens of thousands of years.

In the oceans, it is causing acidification and threatening the food chain. In the atmosphere is is causing global warming. The warming is causing ice melt at the poles and mountains, and warming the north pole more than the equator. The temperature difference between the poles and the equator has caused to jet streams to meander. The meandering jet streams is causing weather systems to be changed. The heated oceans are putting more water into the air.

The result is that we are experiencing extreme weather events, and patterns. We are getting droughts and floods. The droughts are causing an increase in wildfires, and the actual elimination of previously forested areas. The warming poles are causing ice melt that is raising sea levels. These disruptive events are already well underway, and essentially unstoppable without a massive change in how civilization operates.

What is required is the total elimination of fossil fuel use. But that will not be enough. In addition, the excess CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere and oceans to bring the more benign weather back. That can't happen quickly. The only quick action would be the collapse of fossil fuel using civilization. But, then the excess CO2 would not be removed at all.

So, it is well past the time for a non-punishing solution. We have abused the Earth, and now the Earth will abuse us. The best we can do is to make a total transformation to our energy use, reduction in wasteful consumption, and investment in our natural ecosystem. We cannot ignore the laws of nature and live.

On the other hand, if we work with nature, we will have a bright future."

The only problem with your war hawk argument is that people said the same thing in the 1930s regarding Hitler.   People didn't want WW2, but I think in retrospect, it was probably a good thing that the US got involved.    It's our responsibility to take a stand against evil, and what Putin and Assad are doing in Syria is hands down evil.   No buts about it.

Now, I don't want WW3 either, but I can't say for sure that ignoring Russian aggression is the way to go and that seems to be what you're advising.   

The Iran Nuclear deals were actually working.   Not perfect, but progress.   You shouldn't believe everything Trump tells you.   

And you're wrong on climate too.   What inconsistencies are you talking about?   Sure you can find one scientist or one article that says one thing and one that says another, but people publish articles and not everyone agrees.    Individuals with disagreement on certain points doesn't equal inconsistency on the basic theory, which is very strong, very much supported by evidence, very real and very much underway . . . and getting worse.   These are pretty much facts at this point that only fools dispute. 

And if you think I'm wrong, tell me some of these inconsistencies that you suggest exist.

You're also wrong on how much money it will cost to fix it.   Replacing fossil fuels is an enormous expense.   Your assumption that if half the money spent on study was spent on fixes, that it'd be fixed is egregiously incorrect.   You're wrong in Excess.   This is not an easy problem, but it's an important one.    To fix climate change we'd need to plant and maintain trees over an area about 30 times the size of Texas.   Do you think that's easy?   Do you think we have the space or the fresh water to make that a possibility?    I could walk you through the numbers if you doubt me.    I know my math."

The Democratic Party is making all these decisions reguarding climate change, relations between countries, and countless other thing (federal aid programs, infrastructure) all based on what‚Äôs going to keep them in office the longest. Remember the Iran nuclear deals? When Obama‚Äôs plan was to ‚Äúkeep an eye on them‚Äù when their leader clearly pointed out his religious and ancestral hatred towards Israel. I‚Äôm not saying we should intervene with another countries sovereignty BUT left wingers can not claim to have ANY moral high ground. I mean if you do your own research and read the write ups given by these climate control agencies, you don‚Äôt need a degree from college to pick out the inconsistencies in their data. Their whole method is going with something that sounds good and then doubling back and denying they ever said it to protect their asses. You wanna talk about money? What about the multi billion dollar industry that is the climate change initiative, to be honest if we put even half the money they had into preserving forests, and procuring clean water. We could‚Äôve solved those issues years ago.

Anyone with even a bachelor of science degree can see right through all the BS these billionaires are spouting.I am a citizen scientist and the truth is we have less to fear from CO2 and lots to fear from methane. A massive methane release could suffocate everything on the earth that breathes air.Methane is a heavy gas and when liberated from permafrost or the bottom of the ocean will sit on the surface of the earth choking everything.Also all the math indicates that we will go to desertification until we reach a tipping point for a prolonged pluvial event. Meaning first it will be hot as hell then it will get so hot that the oceans will evaporate faster and faster forming clouds that rain back to the earth nonstop. If we let this cycle establish itself we are doomed because it could rain for thousands of years. Even ignoring the problems of sea level rise and high CO2  and methane release,once we continue to add carbon to the atmosphere this will be our fate. I have made a mathematical model showing the rate of ice cap melt with relation to the loss of our magnetic field. Ice melts more slowly in a stronger magnetic field at a given temperature.No one is talking about the fact that we are losing our field and it will be gone in a thousand years.No one cares about what will happen to humanity in a thousand years except maybe Elon Musk who is getting ready to move to Mars."

"OwlNation Legal","2018-07-14T11:17:03Z","I saw a good video dealing with both climate issues and climate deniers, as well as the near-term catastrophic future. It starts with the scientist writing 2+2=4 on a chalkboard, stating if we can't agree on that there's no point arguing with you for a single second. You have issues no evidence can cure. He follows that with known facts, like jumping out a highrise window means you'll die, and if we can't agree on well known scientific facts like that, again there is no point arguing with a suicidal idiot. Then he shows the most important graph; ice extent collapsing, heading to zero and if we can't agree on that and you think both NASA and Greenland eskimos are all lying you have paranoia issues; you are mental. Even Chinese exporters and Russian oil and gas companies are licking their chops as the water opens up. Then he shows rising then raging summer temps and asks if you clearly understand as temps rise cities get warmer, then hotter. Now if we're all still in agreement and you still want to deny we're all going to die you should move to a Phoenix apartment with no AC; a dirt cheap deal, and see how long you survive. In short if you want to argue people, pets and crops can live in 120-130 you're an idiot.and if you can't do the math of a simple graph showing rising temperatures, and extend a temperature trendline graph you have a problem using a crayon he can't cure. At that point recognizing and agreeing high temps are melting ice leading to rising temps and you have firsthand evidence of a positive feedback loop, concluding if you think growing modern crops and livestock in 120-140 degree temps is possible, or you'll survive without food, or water due to rising drought frequency you again, have mental issues and should be locked up as a nut and a danger to yourself until you grow a brain. None of us do well in high temps or a world without food and water; duh. Now that we have agreed on trends and effects with zero debate about it and you've proven you can operate a crayon and aren't insane or a danger to yourself and others, the question becomes do you recognize the difference between zero emission wind and solar versus oil, gas and coal or not. If not and you can't comprehend the well known, proven scientifically measured effects of CO2 and methane as greenhouse gases trapping heat, and can't understand why everyone wants to keep greenhouse gas levels low and temperatures cool, again, you should be locked up as a danger to yourself. You're the kind of idiot unfit to be near gas lines, service station fuel pumps, propane cylinders and 1,001 dangers that require some degree of caution. In conclusion, if you get all this and still want to argue, you're obviously lying; a fraud who should again be charged and arrested as a danger to others. He also reminds us since you're a clear danger to children in the real world you should be shot on sight like a rabid dog. Now that we agree rabid dogs should be shot on sight, knowing a lot of climate deniers have guns, he makes a case for background and mental tests for gun owners, starting with this logical discussion and thereby answering whether or not you're mentally fit to own a gun or even drive a car. People who are a danger to themselves or others should own neither and if you disagree with that we are back to the rabid dog problem; which has a simple solution. This simple paragraph sums up society's catastrophic failure: We're all going extinct simply because we were too kind, too civilized, too stupid and too slow to save humanity and ourselves by simply shooting stubborn stupid climate deniers on sight. POP QUIZ; If a rabid dog or grizzly threatened your kids you would...? Case closed. Knowing this any judge today who allows oil and gas drilling, fracking, pipelines and tankers to continue operating is also a proven danger to society, and while we can't shoot inept or crooked judges as easily as rabid dogs even though they are 1,000,000 times more dangerous, they can and should be immediately removed from public service. Then we can figure out if that judge should own a firearm, a car or operate a gas stove."

 There are many reasons our Globe is Warming and yes Carbons heat the Earth but are truly not that significant, and Carbon tax is a fraud and a scam. However the rotation of the Earth is slowing down. Our electric Magnetic field that protects us and once protected us from the Solar elctro mag waves is now at about 25%. There are also other reasons including Methane release from the Earth which retains heat in our atmosphere 4-0% more then Carbon. Our Earth is Heating up and Core expansion is part of it and many other Reason. ... This is going to happen and has nothing to do with our actions.  We are moving into Pole shift and we could have a cooling afterwards. (Maybe) . There is a Hail Mary that the Elite may uses as its been discussed at least in Theory and that is to Nuke Yellowstone . This would set off the Super Volcano that would cool the Earth but this would NEVER be publicly discussed as many would die without warning. Yellowstone has been active in the last few weeks and perhaps it will go off anyway. I have been studying this for 20 years and there is much Science that I'm not mentioning.

Al Gore's college professor invented Global Warming to get Federal Grants to support himself. It was a scheme. He set out temperature gauges across the USA and used his unpaid interns to gather the data. Unfortunately some of the gauges were in asphalt parking lots. Then he fudged a lot of the data and got grants from the Feds for his ""research"". Al saw it as a way to make money so after his ""I invented the World Wide Web Scheme"" failed he put everything he had into the myth of Global Warming. Now it is another scam to make money. And may I say that even if it were true what the hell do you fools think you can do to change it? You Harry Potter wizards think you can control the weather. Never been done will never be done. Just as the Atlantic was the edge of the flat earth and full of sea monsters until about 1300 you all have swallowed a scam."

Therefore he never gave descriptions or results of the particular samples and how much man made C02 emissions were being pumped into our environment at that time (none). I myself do not know why or how at that moment 275,000 years ago that he speaks of but it could be something as simple as high volcanic eruptions over 100's of years at that time period, there is a lot more data that needs to be shared not just the fat cat that's gonna get richer off this by denying and pushing for coal or another fuel that harms the enviroment. Our planet is only 4.5 billion years old and best we know the start of our species started 6 million years ago. Take the time and research this, the data and facts are there, there is nothing to gain for science to lie. I believe men like this have made thier money burning fossil fuels and do not have the time (life wise) to convert to a greener way of life, they don't care, they wont be here. Research how we found out leaded fuel was harming the environment, that is what lead me to researching the issue and following up."

"sess","2018-07-08T19:02:10Z","first, the difference between the data shown in the ice cores and what we're seeing now is the time it took for the planet to heat up. the ice cores it show that it took thousands of years for the planet to heat up a few degrees. right now the planet is heating up at rates unseen since one of the worst mass extinction events ever. 
second, natural processes put around one hundred times more co2 into the atmosphere than humans do. however, other natural processes absorb the exact same amount of co2. humans are throwing this out of balance. how do we know it's humans? because of the different types of carbon we find in the atmosphere. natural processes generate more co2 made with carbon13. co2 made from burning fossil fuel has significantly less carbon13 in it. so if you check carbon13 levels in the atmosphere, we see carbon13 shrinking due to fossil fuels.

They very clearly were claiming (as if it were a fact) that the ice caps were growing at an alarming rate and that by the mid to late 1980's that we would not be able to live in any of the coastal cities of the world because of the dead and dying sea life would be so terrible. I remember this because I was in High School at the time and it was all over the NEWS. Ice age, Global warming, it is all the same and for the same reason, control. They (the perpetrators) all want us running scared, running from our own shadows, and they have everyone (nearly) believing anything that the 'idiot box' tells us!

"Slider68","2018-07-05T01:25:26Z","Why are so many of you so quick to believe some rich guy who claims banks will only let you invest in things that are safe and banks will protect you from making risky investments? During the housing meltdown banks were found guilty of encouraging people to invest in overpriced properties that they couldn't afford. There is no evidence anywhere that I'm aware of that shows banks will protect you from making poor investments. Only if the investment is so bad that the bank itself will lose money will they stop things.

While there is money to be made on both sides of the climate change debate, there are far more wealthy, well established companies with political, lobbying and marketing power that will make more money by being able to pollute more and release more CO2, etc. Why do you believe that the smaller, less influential ""green"" companies have the power to convince the world that a huge lie is true? How can less powerful companies somehow have more power and influence than huge, powerful corporations?

On the science side, climate change was debated for many years. Over time though, almost all scientific research bodies have come to the conclusion that not only is global warming occurring, but that there is an almost certainty that man is the biggest contributor to this warming.

Take a look at this wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change and do some reading. From a scientific perspective the debate is over.

There is still uncertainty in how much climate change is going to occur and the precise relationship between pollution created and climate change, but to say humans are not contributing to climate change at all demonstrates either a lack of understanding or a deliberate twisting of facts in order to maximize profits.

BTW, I wish climate change wasn't caused by CO2 and other man made pollution. I love high performance vehicles, including smelly, smokey 2-strokes and would much prefer to be able to remove catalytic converters and run powerful, gas guzzling 8+ liter engines in my vehicles. In reality most tree huggers would hate me but at least I'm not delusional and claiming my gas guzzling machines are not contributing in my own small way to undesirable climate change. If there were a few billion humans like me, climate change would be a total disaster..."

The banks gave loans to people who could not even prove a source of income. People were buying homes without down payments. People even bought homes in their dogs names. The banks would just sell the loans to other banks and wash their hands of them. How can we continue to ignore 98% of the scientific community?"
"Gamaliel Padilla","2018-06-30T15:05:37Z","So basically there are 2 scenarios here. One is that deniers are right and global warming is a scam, or Two, the environmentalists are right and pollution is causing global warming. The point here is that if environmentalists are wrong, there may be lack of GDP growth and higher taxes, or even a recesion, but if the climate change deniers are the ones who are wrong,  the level of damage could go as far as sea levels rising, severe droughts,  floodings and famine due to poor crops production, and other issues (that coul only be surpassed by a Nuclear War aftefmath), which could not be reversed after decades of pollution. We have survived recessions,  but I doubt thet we could all survive an environmental crisis. So there is your answer, we just cant afford the deniers to be wrong, there are things that you just cant risk to happen, and this is one of them. Global Warming is not a scam. It is real an it is already here."

You're already paying for climate change right now, and will continue to do so.  You are bailing out the ass of all the victims of extreme weather events of which we are already seeing happen from climate change.    You think some higher cost renewable electricity (at least higher cost in the short term because as it becomes widespread costs will come down - kind of like they did for fossil fuel electricity decades ago) is bad wait until you're buying out all the flooding coastal cities!

"Cause Reasons","2018-06-29T05:38:58Z","People have to realize that global warming isn‚Äôt just a sea level thing. There are very many other problems which global warming creates.

 It produces more evaporation in the seas, which in turn produces crazier weather, like the huge ass hurricanes which battered the southern U.S. and Puerto Rico. Other crazy weather events such as tornadoes, flash floods, and incredibly hot temperatures will also inevitably be present.

While the Earth may have been 2 degrees warmer 50,000+ years ago, it has had that much time to cool to the temperatures which were seen around 100 years ago. In other words, wildlife had time to adapt. If we warm 2 degrees in 200 years versus 50,000, there will be enormous consequences to both flora and fauna. Arctic species will die in the warmth, coral reefs will boil and bleach, insects such as ticks and mosquitoes will have longer summers in which to breed, and become more numerous. 

Don‚Äôt deny that humans are causing the climate to warm at an extreme and damaging rate. I would rather see Climate Change proved a complete hoax after intense preparation for it, than it increase exponentially and cause major catastrophe. We‚Äôre much better off safe than sorry. 

And who knows, convincing ourselves to use  renewable fuel or majorly conserve resources might just be a good idea."

He also misses an opportunity to ask her about her solution. It's unlikely her own remedies are realistic, if she even has one at all. There's simply not enough evidence to support major changes in climate, far less to warrant crashing the global economy to forcibly implement inefficient alternative energies that are in their infancy and unproven to even be effective quickly enough. I'm not denying a need for R&D, or climate change, but rushing to find a cure will likely lead to abandoning the research even before development. Since, the demand for a quick solution from the already overburdened population will be so high from to having to fund it."

Of course the problem in the US is that ~90% of the population are too stupid to understand the scientific evidence...true OR false. They wouldn't understand a scientific fact if it slapped them between the eyes! Most people know enough science to turn on a light switch and thats about it."

Say what you want about the extent humans play in the warming process, but it's a straight up fact that the earth has been warming since the 1900s and that total sea ice is melting. See my NASA links below. 

Why would condominium owners not be reporting advising possible buyers about sea level rise? Well obviously, they want to sell the property and will try to under-play any faults. Additionally, the Federal Government's National Flood Insurance program will re-imburse investors from any flooding damage as a result of sea level rise. A great example of the Federal government creating a moral hazard. And a final possible reason, mentioned by real estate consultant Peter Zalewski, is that when people buy condos _""they're looking to invest their money, look for a little uptick in the pricing and then dump it""_. Which explains why they're not considering long term risks.

Pena is an absolute joke. I cannot believe so many people found his argument (if you can even call it that) convincing in the slightest. USA is fucked.

Also, his logic about banks not lending money to places near the sea is fundamentally flawed. You only have to look at how happily they fucked up half the world's economy in 2008 by lending to people they KNEW had no chance of paying back their loans to see that. OK regulations were brought in in the aftermath but the way the banks were bailed out will only embolden them to take advantage of people in similar ways in future. Those individual homeowners don't matter to the banks - family loses their home, goes bankrupt, the bank simply writes off the debt and is reimbursed by their insurance company, in turn covered by reinsurance firms. The poor fucker who's lost his home will suffer of course - credit rating fucked and even if he does secure a loan in future it will be at a crippling interest rate. If anything that person has just become a more lucrative customer for the bank, as it can lend less money at a more punitive rate.
No, Dan. You're looking at it way too superficially. Not surprising for someone espousing this view of climate change. Next he'll be insisting that because it was a bit cold last week there can't be any global warming."
"Leto Kahn","2018-06-26T11:55:33Z","Here is the thing.
If Global Warming is a scam it is a really good scam.
Because somehow the scientists have altered the climate in a way that it can fool everyone.
I am 57 years old. I grew up in Ottawa, Canada until I was 34 years old. I remember well what the weather was like there. Cold winters of -30 to -35 Celsius and hot short summers of 30+ Celsius. Ottawa is the home of Canada's longest rink, the Rideau Canal which stays open 4 to 5 months of the year.
At 34 I moved to Vancouver and lived there for 18 years. I then went back to Ottawa for 2 years. That convinced me that Global Warming is indeed real.
The weather in Ottawa has changed. It is now warmer than it ever was before. The coldest it got during the winter was -22 Celsius. We even had winter heatwaves where you could go outside in your shorts and t-shirts. The Rideau Canal was open for skating for just 18 days. That is an insane change.
When I was young, you would hear of the natural disasters from time to time but they rarely happened. You might hear of 1 or 2 a year. Now we get them every day.
So if the scientists are scamming us then it is a damn good scam."

How much higher the temperature will rise is predicted by the CO2 in the atmosphere, again, atmospheric CO2 levels, this is a measured amount.  The long term CO2 record, historical and prehistoric, is well established, by air trapped in ice, or  mud from the ocean bottoms.  

CO2 levels have never been this high

When you are in Sebring, Florida, USA, you can look at the dirt on the roadside, sand,,,, dig a hole absolutely anywhere in the native sandy soil, and you will find in every shovel full, sea shells,,, lots and lots of seashells.  And they are not fossils, they are shells. Sebring was the coast of Florida sometime, or more times, in the last 100,000 years,  Sebring is 140 feet above sea level.  It is one of the higher elevations in the entire state of Florida.   A sea level that can grow sea shells in Sebring puts London and New York City completely under water.  Even Paris, France, 100 miles inland from the sea, would be under water.

Dan Pena has the intelligence of an ostrich with his head stuck in the sand.  Can't see light,, so light does not exist,,,, but the sun IS warming his butt.  Just that he thinks his butt is warmer for no reason.  Global warming is not theory, it is measured,, it is happening now,, how hot?, how fast?,, that we can guess and estimate,, based upon measurements of the last hundred years.

And what is Bill Nyes usage in the heirarchy of evidence when he states in one of his arguments, ""We dont agree on the facts""? How do and when do facts disagree in the hierarchy of evidence?

On critical theory wasnt that suppose to be a bad thing in used as a tool by social scientists to inverse logic on the American people and thats why we see blm and feminists so pre dominant on college campuses today?"

There is no ""idiot half"" as people on both sides of this divide are normally intelligent people who, unfortunately, have differing, yet honest, worldviews.  If you are one who thinks it is O.K. to mock those who disagree with you, and refer to them as ""imbeciles"" for not seeing things as you do, then perhaps it is you who should be mocked.  However, Evolution is an unproven hypothesis that, in fact, has no proof of actually having occurred even once, let alone billions of billions of times as its proponents would have us believe.  The only thing that you can point to as ""evolution"" that you think you have observed is nothing more than the ""variations"" or ""adaptations"" within a species (or more exactly, a ""kind"") of animal. That is not evolution!   I don't think that you are stupid, but I do think that Evolution is a very dumb idea.  I understand that when you've been lied to your whole life by people you trusted but there are different ways of looking at things that make a whole lot more sense than this ridiculous ""theory."""

"bobby 33x","2018-06-28T19:45:11Z","Patrick, when you make a patently MORONIC statement like this: ""This argument doesn‚Äôt matter, because people only take beliefs from parents."" That's total B/S and not substantiated by fact.  Former Far Left writer David Horowitz was the child of two avowed Communists  and joined the Far left Black Panthers in the '60s. In the 1980s he awoke to the phoniness & idiocy of the Left (try reading his autobiography: RADICAL SON) and is now a staunch defender of Individual Liberty and Western Culture. And I can site dozens of others who were born to Left-Wing Morons and have had similar transformations in their beliefs.
When you make a ""popular"" but patently stupid statement like that you lose all credibility.
As far as science & Global Warming are concerned, there are scientists on both sides of the question. Which is precisely why we shouldn't be making insane policy decisions which will result in the LOWERING of living standards around the world and whose most deleterious effects of such policies will fall hardest on the poorest."

It can be dated.  The dates can prove what type of CO2 is in the atmosphere.  It is conclusive from oil deposits. The science is so precise, CO2 can be measured  by region and exactly what the CO2 came from. But, oil is not all of it.  Trees are dying at an incredible rate.  Healthy trees absorb and cleanse CO2.  Dying trees release it back into the environment.  Plants also absorb CO2.  When farmers plow, that CO2 is released back into the atmosphere.  Only 50% of the CO2 humans produce could be traced.  Then, they learned, the Ocean is absorbing CO2.  That is heating up the water and the high temperature melts ice bergs from the bottom causing the ice break off.  Yes, the earth has gone through hot and cold spells. But in the past it has all been by natural causes.  This time, it is human. Not just oil, it is only one part.  It is all of human activity.  That activity from farming, to driving cars, to cultivating crops to cutting trees, to slash and burn can now all be measured and there is no speculation anymore.

What happens if your engine runs out of oil? Fucking schooled!!! Good luck! 
You do the math!!!
40 years * 40 million barrels a day* weight. still a skeptic? our government knows!
The US pumped millions of barrels of oil from Alaska in the 40s 50s and 60s. Alaska had a Major earthquake in the 60s. One of the biggest earthquakes in recorded history.

THE DEEP STATE AND THE MEDIA.
To operate a Deep State within a Government system you must be sure that you have the MSM outlets, the PRESS and the SOCIAL MEDIA under your control. 
The last year shows very clear that this is the case  in America. Notice that this is already for several decades going on, but was never so obvious to recognize like this past year. The MEDIA is the biggest problem the American people are facing today. They serve the Deep State to be their coverup and their support tool. Without the paticipation they can't operate this corrupt and criminal organisation. So do not underestimated the role of the MSM outlets , the Newspapers and the social media platforms they are crucial to keep their power.  The Media all work together and provides the American people the leaks which are given by the Deep State. All their news items are coordinated which has a special team which directed the several fake  scenario's which they all exercise first, like they cast a new actor. 
They need the Media to coverup their illegal actions, to have their own service-hatch to serve their leaks and always support the Deep State given narrative in all their operations. But they overestimated their own posibility's born out of arrogance towards the American public. They insulted the intelligence of the American public many times. Untill they maked one big mistake. This occurred when they wanted the American people to let believe that the law of nature not longer excist. Because they still defended the outcome of the 9/11 committee report which was full of crap and was a total shame to the American public and the rest of the World to dare to come with such a idiotic outcome.
Remember these two horrible moments when these two giant towers came down in such a free fall speed and were solved into dust. When this was not enough, building 7 collapsed also which was even more unthinkable and simply impossible
The speed how fast these three buildings came down was simply not possible without there were preparations made to make this possible. Also the reason why they both came down is a fabricated fairy tale which NEVER was possible by fire or the impact of the airplane which destroyed this solid steel structure . Several laws of nature speak direct against these conclusions in the 9/11 commission report. But like always the MSM outlets and their anchors keep them on track with all kinds of distractions from the real narrative.To put the public finally in wintersleep again. They know that at the longterm the people will give up, because the people realise when you fight with somebody which is simply unreasonable, then you never wil be able to win from such a person. When I investigated the Las Vegas massacre from 1  okt 2017,  i noticed how many true faults were maked which could be used as real evidence,  which they could not debunk, after some more investigation I became convinced that this was a thoroughly well planned False Flag operation,  There where actually no deadly victims  most some wounded people with a small bullit wound was possible.This issue you let slowly into your mind until you realise which  consequences this state of mind could mean. 
But the more I discovered the more acceptable my way of thinking became more and more real. 
Every time I found something new, i forced myself to look also in the old fashion way. 
But the outcome was exactly the same this was for 100% a false flag operation. Executed by the Intell agencies into accomplish this for the Deep State. About this event I wrote VII Chapters  which are based on the facts look into my eyes and you can see where those snipers were hidden 
When the MSM Outlets defended the fake narrative, I realised that the partioners gave a good impression how big this Deep State must be. 
There are many YOUTUBE  channels which are actually working for the Deep State and provide them information to keep the public under their control. Because their is only one thing which the Deep State really have fears and got a spontaneous highly allergic reaction, when the American people become one, one coherent solid power, the shit will fully exposed in their pants. That's why the MSM outlets highlighted certain  issues in a regular way which contribute to keep this diversity in place. They are not there to bring the people together at the contrary they all will  divide you. This diversity is also a essential part for a Deep State organisation. To divide a population makes it easier to control them.
Now the most of the  Media outlets , the newspapers and the social Media like FB ,INSTAGRAM , TWITTER AND YOUTUBE are ALL serving the Deep State.Trump was very smart and recognised the importace of a direct communication line with the American public s to use their own weapeon
,Twitter and they can't block him thats why they wants to stop him of tweeting . This is Trump his direct line to the American public. Simple
Now be aware that all these social media outlets play their deceiving role.
They gather info which freely ended at the desks of the FBI. They analyze 
this info to give a adjust answer if necessary."

People still believed his prediction was proven correct. The sooner people understand Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030, the better. The problem is people hate confessing they were conned."

"Exiled_Londoner","2018-06-24T22:06:27Z","So this guy is a complete idiot and his audience are mostly too stupid to grasp the con trick being played on them as well. His basic argument is that the banks are still lending money on long term investments that will be worthless if global warming raises sea levels in a few decades, ergo it's a scam (because we all know how reliable the banks are at forecasting the future of everything). The banks are part of the whole structure of ostrich-style denial so of course they close their eyes to reailty as well. Global Warming and the Climate Change it will bring (as well as rising sea levels) will make all long term investments worthless because if civilisation collapses into violent chaos and mass starvation then there will be no way of collecting debts or enforcing any contracts. If the banks took a realistic view of the likely events over the remainder of this century then many of them would have to shut down as their long term projections would make them unviable. But of course they can't just admit reality and say it's too late to save the consumer society' (which is what their profits and dividends depend on),  or 'we have to abandon the quest for never-ending economic growth' (which is what capitalism is predicated on)... so they just go along with the pretence and hope that none of the shit hits the fan while they are still around to get splattered. They develope standard rukes for ""calculating"" future returns (and insurance companies do the same with actuarial odelling) that invent a fictitious future based on wishful thinking. This is how millions of people (just in the UK) were sold so-called ""Pension Plans"" and Endowmenr Mortgages based on projections of 5 - 8% annual growth when everyone in the business knew that this was ludicrously over optimistic.

It is overwhelmingly likely that Florida will disappear this century (and good riddance) and that my home town (and the city I currently live in) will have to invest enormous amounts of money and personnel in building higher sea defences. It is also quite possible that these efforts will be useless in the long run because saving individual towns and cities will not stop most of the world's population from starving or dying in global conflicts triggered by the collapse of nations and of global trade (which is what allows us in the UK to eat)."

"Tarzan","2018-06-24T20:31:49Z","Another chip at the leftist lies. I never believed it. If it was really going to happen, the governments of the world would be doing everything to prevent it. They‚Äôd be evacuating low lying places and investing and building on all the higher peace‚Äôs of land. You‚Äôd be paying 10 times the price for land on the side of a mountain, than you‚Äôd pay for a peace of land in central London.
However even if leftists see this, they‚Äôll just double down. They have too much of an ego to admit that they were taken in.
These white middle class liberals are jealous of the rich and they despise the working class, that‚Äôs the whole reason why they‚Äôre such sanctimonious cunts."
"Gilles Milaire","2018-06-24T20:00:42Z","Apparently the bankers know more about climate change than they know about the 2007 / 2009 great recession, one of the many they've caused every 4 to 7 years on average, bankers aren't known for being financial geniuses. Pena is a real doofus who knows how to say big fancy swear words. The woman in the crowd was equally silly to ask this loud mouth idiot about this topic he is clearly not an authority. Frankly I don't give a shit if there's such a thing as global warming, just need to watch a few Tony Seba talks on renewables. ""The stone age didn't end because they ran out of stones"" and the same goes for the fossil fuel industry (quoting a Saudi Prince). You can easily find climate change  maps from several sites on the internet, Pena makes some nutty claims that Antarctica is on a mountaintop? Antarctica is a continent, the research stations are not on mountaintops. The climate change maps clearly show that a 10 foot rise in sea level doesn't even approach his false and exaggerated claims. Very disappointed in Pena talking rubbish."

As I said before, I've done the research and don't care to debate it anymore.  No time for that.  I do not subscribe to conspiracy theories.  I am not aligned with either party.  I do consider myself a good steward of the planet and am concerned with preserving it.  I do know that the time period in which humans have been creating CO2 gas, and inhabiting the Earth for that matter, is miniscule compared to the history of the planet.  There is always climate change - no doubt.  It is cyclical.  The effect that humans are having on it and have had on it from CO2 gases however, is negligible, and not at anything near a crisis level that some people would have you believe.  Once an idea has been said enough times and loud enough, it eventually becomes ""fact"" and that's what has happened with this climate change issue.  I know you are passionate about what you believe, and you certainly have a right to express your opinion.  If we all believed exactly the same things - it would be pretty boring.

but yeah sure 97% of scientists going back to the late 1890s all plotted together to create a grand scam for what? it can't be money scientists and politician get a set amount of money in their salary that doesn't increase with taxes, and the idea that they are getting paid to make this grand scam up to what end? You think politicians like hurting the industries that lobby money to them? Surely it would be more profitable to be paid by the coal and gas industries instead of making up science. The is because their not there is no logical reason why climate scientists would fabricate this.

What is certainly true is this humanity releases roughly 40 billion tons of co2 into the environment the next largest producer volcanoes emit about 500 million tons and we know that co2 is the chief regulator of the greenhouse effect and we know that co2 levels have increased by 40% since the start of the industrial revolution and as the old saying goes ""if it walks like a duck talks like it duck its a duck"" it is certanly humans that have caused this no other naturally phenomenon accounts for it"

"Dan D","2018-08-10T22:33:05Z","Finally, a dialogue that isn't all a troll. I don't do church. I learned long ago many of them and the people that go are no better than any other sinner accept they are all huddled in a mass thinking they are somehow better than others because they are practicing a religion. However, I experienced more than one miracle. I think many people do but either ignore it, dismiss it as a coincidence, or flat out block it out because they don't want to be accountable for their poor choices. In any of those cases ignorance of the truth doesn't make the consequences any different. As far as the bible goes (king James new testament), the parts about right and wrong are right on. I did take a few philosophy classes in college and have studied as much as I could since my first obvious miracle. That said I know there is something on the other side that is good, that wants to help. I don't think they can help when ""choice"" is involved. I don't know why children die of cancer or people (monsters) are allowed to inflict such horrible suffering and torture on good people in the world. Those are all things that don't make sense. All that said from my fifty years, I have no doubt  there is a god. As far as religion goes, I actually prayed on an answer for that just before I went to bed when I was 18,  just after my best friend had killed himself. In my prayer I asked god to send someone by of the religion he wanted me to follow. The next morning I woke up, looked at my clock just as it went from 9:59am to 10:00am and there was a knock on my front door on queue. Wouldn't you know it, there was a Jehovah witness there. I said to myself ""oh fuck no, not those guys"" (my mom hated them). So I called some close friends of our family that were devout Catholics, but they weren't home. They had left on vacation and a nun who was watching their house answered their phone. So I told her the story. She said they don't go door to door and I was meant to call her. Through the years I have come to have faith that as long as you are doing what you know is right you can follow any religion that suits you. Like everything we are put here to do, t is a choice. As far as wasted time, how can being good be such a waste of time? Do what your heart tells you to do and try to have faith if you can. Start by not turning a blind eye when a miracle lands in your lap."

During the Pliocene about 3 million years ago sea level was 50-80 feet higher than it is today. It is just a matter of time till we get there...rates of glacial ice loss from Greenland has tripled in the last 10 years. Last year it was reported that Greenland is now burning! There are peat fires on Greenland for Christ sake. So this is another positive feed back. As it warms up there the peat will dry up and lightning (which has increased about 11-12% globally- that's what happens when you warm the world and put more moisture into the air) will start more fires. The soot from these fires will be deposited on the ice sheet darkening it's surface. This of course will increase the melt rate and so it goes. Frankly, you shouldn't trust anyone in a suit anymore and brace yourself for the next crash as the derivatives market is well over 100 TRILLION $ while world debt has doubled since the last subprime Bush debacle of 08-09.

We should shift our focus into preparing for the mass people-migrations that will occur when coastal areas (where the majority of the world's population now lives) have to move to higher ground because their home (e.g. Miami, New Orleans) is under water. 

Hey Denver, get ready for millions of refugees from places like Miama and New Orleans. After all, the Defense Department is already prepping for this scenario. It might not happen during our lifetimes, but your descendants will be faced with living underwater if they live at sea level.

"Anker Alaphelt","2018-06-23T04:15:38Z","Hilarious. That's it, follow the money. And who has the most money to lose if we switch to renewable energy sources? Not that this is entirely possible anyway, but the answer is obvious...big oil, gas, and coal. Frankly, it is probably already to late to avert disaster. Even if we manage to reduce emissions to ZERO by 2050 it is likely that we will shoot past 500 ppm by then and global temps will be 2 C higher than they are now. The outcome will spell disaster for American agriculture, the oceans, coral reefs, and dry lands which will become deserts. Also, we only have about 20 years of conventional oil left anyway so I don't think industrial civilization will make it that far anyway. Our soils are degraded and eroding at 1% per year and we are running out of phosphorus and water (fossil water) as well, along with a variety of base metals. I think the prognosis is poor at this point because we cannot separate the resource stream from the economy and we also cannot figure out how to conduct a complex economy without front loading it with debt. The debt is now twice what it was during the 08-09 subprime crisis and here in the US it is going exponential at twice the rate of growth of the economy. We are fu#$ked. Say goodbye. I think we crash in a couple of years, go into stagnation/deflation for about another 15 years and then game over.

Firstly, not one scientific paper claims that sea levels will rise 10 feet in 40 years, in fact they claim 2 feet in 100 years. He gets the age of the Earth wrong.

He doesn't understand that Global Warming is indeed a natural SELF CORRECTING phenomenon and goes up and down from a number of different factors such as CO2, the Sun and reflection of sunlight. What he certainly doesn't understand is that Human industry is disrupting the self-correcting process of climate change and causing temperatures to go exponentially up. 

I doubt this man has ever actually read scientific paper or even met a climate scientist.

Al Gore didn't invent climate change, he just ruined any attempt at civil discourse about it."

"David Lloyd","2018-06-21T21:48:30Z","Developing economies and increase in population has an impact on ""global warming"", the earth is 4.5 billion yrs old. He is right about if this threat is so real and imminent why are financial institutions ignoring or disregarding it. In the concept of time he is right about time periods - this is a gradual change happening over decades. If it is happening from man-made effects it is irreversible and can only be mitigated i.e slowed down but will still happen but probably with changes in 10, 20, 50-100 years.

There is truth but this is scandalous because the scientific evidence is not empirical when an Armageddon would happen. Volcanoes erupt, Tsunamis occur as a result of nature and have little to do with global warming, yet volcanic ash can create CO2 and methane rises, wiped out the dinosaurs. Would hotels be built along coast of Asia and Sri Lanka if known Tsunamis would occur. Yes, because probability of statistics Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment PTHA this cannot be determined. Tsunamis, Volcanoes happen they are witnessed, Man made contributions to Global warming is happening but with imperceptible changes over years (decades).

Can you stop an earthquake ? no..
Can you stop a volcano erupting ? no
Can you stop a tsunami occurring? no
Can you stop global warming? no

Scientifically it is happening, but not with the alarmist levels it is being portrayed as. To some countries it is a threat with rise in sea levels. His points at 3:19 are valid and puts it into perspective. He's rude, direct and vulgar about his point, his facts are inaccurate and exaggerated though, ""13.8 billion years for this planet"" - it is 4.5 billion It is a fraud used by insurance, finance companies etc  based on statistical analysis in much the same way as flood insurance.

The reality is that some suckers have bought hook, line and sinker into the marxist propaganda to hate those who have wealth because without dividing human beings against one another marxist ideology falls flat on it's face because every single leftist political ideology is predicated upon the theft of wealth from those who earned it to finance their agenda.  

So it matters not whether it's liberal, progressive, socialist or marxist but that if it's a leftist political policy then it's theft.  

That's the first reality.  The fact of the matter is that some 61% of the global population lives either in a coastal city or a coastal plain and yet there's no mad dash of humanity moving inland and upland due to the hypothesized fairy tale of rising ocean levels.  Whether it's Hawaii, Bermuda, the Bahamas or any other island vacation destination they are all doing absolutely fine in terms of tourism because climate change is an absolute farce.  

And here's where the rub will make libturds butthurt raw.  If the earth's temperatures are rising, and ice is melting and oceans are rising, which is all hypothesized by the climate change alarmists, then that means more lichens will grow, more grasses will grow, more plants will grow, more shrubs will grow and more trees will grow and all those forms of plant life will eat what and produce what?  That's how you know that climate change is a bunch of unmitigated bullshit.

what ""findings of their research""??  theproperties of co2 & the greenhouse effet were discivered like 250 years ago by a REAL scientist.   ""with what you call climate scientists, it's the same old thing, over & over & over.....they make speculations on what could/might/could possibly/may happen if co2 reached certain hypothetical levels.

""if you're wrong, we're all dead""...... & you wanna talk about emotional crapola???   gimme a break.   there is nothing happening on this planet that never happened before.   

if you would care to provide a scientific problem statement like, hmmmm let's take hurricanes, for example, you guys love hurricanes.....tell me what the problem is  ---  like yall are always whining about more hurricanes.....so tell me how many hurricanes per year are acceptable & why, compared to how many we have now & how many you predict in the foreseeable future.  provide back up data.
then tell me how much you need to reduce co2 to reach your acceptable level of hurricanes.  how?  economic & social impacts, costs, etc.  & when.   provide back up data, computations & verifiable test results.

see?   real science.   real science is hard work.....way harder than whining... ""OMG, we're all gonna die, we're all gonna die if something isn't done.....we don't know what to do but we're all gonna die if whatever it is isn't done""!!!

The proof is out there all u need to do is open your eyes, 
coral reefs¬†have been around for upto 500 million years & they are dying out due to water temp rising a few degrees. Then there is the polar ice caps melting..

Look watch the lion king as it's a movie that points out the nature  & balance of life forms, u know the f#@king circle of life, only problem is humans are rapidly increasing in numbers & we r top of food chain  so  that equals less deaths more births..

"William Ferraiolo‚Äôs Introductory Philosophy Stuff","2018-06-15T21:58:53Z","My name is Dr. William Ferraiolo. I have twenty five years of experience teaching, researching, and publishing articles in academic journals. I have authored a book which contains a collection of meditations in the Stoic tradition that I believe would be an excellent addition to your personal or institutional library. This collection is unique in that each meditation is presented in the second person, encouraging the reader to examine their struggles and failures in the pursuit of self-improvement and enlightenment. The following is a sample meditation that illustrates this:

‚ÄúEverything that can suffer, does suffer. Everything that can die, will die. You have suffered, you will suffer much more, and a lifetime of your suffering will culminate in your death. When you can muster genuine gratitude for all of that, then you will have made the kind of progress that is not easily reversed. To develop sincere appreciation for this opportunity to be born in a brutal world, not of your making, to struggle and fail time and time again, to feel repeatedly lost, bewildered, frustrated, and hopeless, to swim in this ocean of misery, and, ultimately, to drown in it‚Äîthis is the beginning of wisdom. You must embody overwhelming gratitude for the opportunity to fail repeatedly, with no guarantee of eventual success, and to wade cheerfully into a doomed struggle against time and your own limitations. You clamber toward your own death across a landscape of thorns, broken glass, and the corpses of those who have gone before you. Would you have it any other way?‚Äù

You can purchase my book through Amazon (see link below):

"stevebrownrocks","2018-06-15T19:50:15Z","I totally agree w/ the reality of climate change, & here's why;
Every day, EVERY SINGLE DAY, it get strangely bright outside for 12 hours or so, & during certain months, especially during summer, it gets VERY hot outside(sometimes over 100 degs.
Conversely, for another 12 hrs or so, a strange darkness replaces the light we had, & the temp goes down 20degs or so. It gets really dark outside, it's actually a bit frightening.
These light-dark hot-cool phenomenon go on like clockwork, every other 12 hr cycle is much warmer than the previous dark cycle. This proves global warming is true, it goes on constantly."

1, Life cycle of condo probably 40-70 years, expected start of dramatic sea rise 70-80 years away probably not going to see his 10ft till well into next century ( I'm not even going to check the latest)

2, by the time sea level rise was a critical issue (all coastal civilization displaced) the other effects of climate change would have disrupted food production supply and global trade and we would be dealing with that in a mad max world for decades

3, by the time their is a 10 ft rise which financial institutions and legal systems and governments would any condo owner seek compensation from? And, is it not likely that an insurance company would just be like blah blah whatever or we're bankrupt

1910 - Camille Flammarion -- the appearance of Hailey's Comet would 'impregnate the atmosphere and potentially snuff out all life on the planet'.  He sold 'comet pills' that would protect against 'toxic gases'.

1982 - Pat Robertson -- a televangelist; he predicted the world would end this year.  He is currently among the wealthiest televangelists in the world.

-- -- -- If you can find a way to scare people witless; they might give you money.  Spend some time reading through physics, biology, genetics, chemical academic forums and you'll see that grant money is scarce and competition is quite fierce. [1][2]

With less and less grant money available to fund useful research; one tactic is to scare people into giving you money.  Even climate scientists need to pay the mortgage; and it's better to do that by conducting climate research (which they've spent many many years earning advanced degrees to do) than it is flipping burgers or working as janitors [3] (which some of them would have to do if they couldn't find higher paying work).  [4]

Under conditions where many need to compete for scarce resources; do you really believe that this would produce the most honest science?  [5]

Imagine spending 4 years earning a bachelor's degree in physics, biology, math, or chemistry.  Then you spend another 3-6 years earning a Masters degree, then a Phd.  Imagine spending between 3-12 years in limbo as a Postdoc only to come to the realization that you have to give up all this time invested as a researcher because no matter how many grant proposals you write, you can't get enough funding!!!  You're not rich -- you don't have any friends in high places.  At this time you have a spouse, and perhaps a child or two.  What are you going to do?  How will you pay for food and shelter for your family?  The answer:  you fight tooth and nail for anything you can.

There are politicians and activists getting rich on global warming.  They keep shilling their nonsense and distracting from the real issues.  After 2008; many people are STILL homeless, there are refugees from many countries whose problems stem from political instability (news sites report that global warming is responsible for the Syrian refugee crisis; and the ignore the dictator who has been gassing his own people) [6]

Wages across the US and Europe are stagnant; people are afraid, college graduates are finishing school deep in debt and working for mcdonalds or starbucks and we are to believe that all of these woes were caused by global warming and not the greedy morons wielding MBAs from high class universities who turned the worldwide economy into a crater.  [7]

Let's worry about famine, and lack of water because we don't have the resources to generate COPIOUS amounts of electricity if we have to rely on wind and solar.  Nevermind the fact that we have the technology to build fission plants that generate COPIOUS amounts of electricity cheaply -- with said electricity, we could generate all the fresh water we could ever need; keep the lights on and the air conditioners, or the heaters running.  But we won't, because NIMBY tells you that fission is the bogeyman that'll end the world.  The end of the world won't be next year, but you can bet that some asshole out there can make money by telling you it will.

"Adam Bram","2018-06-03T12:49:35Z","The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine put out a video that illustrates most of the hundreds of lines-of-evidence that explain why 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and caused by humans. You can see that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIUN5ziSfNc. If you are at all open-minded and just want to know what the truth is, I recommend it. I'd also recommend watching Before the Flood (http://watchdocumentaries.com/before-the-flood/) and Six Degrees Could Change the World (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_pb1G2wIoA). Both are free to watch. Before the Flood can be found via a Google search. Please just watch them with an open mind. If you are still convinced it's a hoax or natural, that's fine. There is nothing wrong with being skeptical, as long as you are willing to try to know the truth.

I was skeptical, as well. I thought I had all sorts of logical arguments about why global warming was natural. It was warmer in the past. We are at the end of an ice age. Trees will soak up CO2. I have a degree in engineering, and I‚Äôve taken several meteorology classes. I thought that meant I had enough of a scientific background to know that my logic made sense that climate change was natural.  I no longer believe that. The logic I used was terribly flawed. It's a complex and somewhat abstract problem. It's easy to laugh away the evidence and assume it's natural.

I not only believe humans are causing global warming; I believe the threat is far worse than I ever knew. The logic that you see from Dan Pena in this video is basically that the banks are investing in Florida beachfront condos; therefore global warming is not a threat. Mr. Pena, the banks invested in bad mortgage loans right up to the day of the 2007-2008 financial crisis that they created. What do the banks know about climate change? They weren't even able to see evidence about bad loans, which is a field they should have had expertise in.

This is the type of mistake that so many people make. It's tempting to cherry pick a piece of ""evidence"" that fits our prior opinions and base our arguments on that evidence. Climate scientists continue to try to find flaws in their own conclusions in order to make their understanding of nature better. People like Dana Pena do the opposite. They grab any argument they can to convince people that everything that science has discovered is wrong or fraudulent. It's not about wanting to know the truth to them. It's about not wanting to be wrong. It's a profund difference.

We are talking about a threat that may kill hundreds of millions of people in the next century. Your children and grandchildren are going to feel the very real effects of this. This is not about polar bears or eroding coastlines. This is far worse than that. When we begin to kill off critical parts of food chains, we will see suffering and starvation in many species, including humans. If you are not even willing to accept you may be wrong, you are essentially betting the lives of your grandchildren that this is not happening. You are assuming that adding billions of tons of CO2 to the carbon cycle has no effect on climate.

Is this a big hoax? Ask yourself who has the motivation to deceive the public about climate change. Climate scientists who may earn a modest, middle-class income, or oil companies who stand to lose billions of dollars if the status quo is changed? I understand the skepticism, but there must come a point when we stop letting people like Dan Pena deceive us. He really is putting the lives of your children and grandchildren at risk."

So they die first. But, some of them make it to maturity and are able to find mates and have babies. Some of these animals live longer and have more babies then others. Using simple math you can figure whatever physical and mental traits that the animals had who had the most babies will be passed to the most children. That means that if there is a trait that helped a species live longer, like a giraffe being able to reach higher leaves, thus giving it access to food that others couldn't eat, will help that individual animal to live longer and possibly have more babies. Say the giraffe has 5 babies in its life and then dies. It's children will have some differences. Some faster or slower, shorter or taller. The children with the best suited traits will reproduce with others of similar traits, and so over time a species will slowly change to match it's environment."

The Securities Exchange Commission is requiring that disclosure even though FASB is not asking us to do so. So, Dan is right. If there is an effect on global warming that will cause severe harm to the investment, accountants and lawyers who write the prospectuses must disclose this under ASC 275."

IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR TYPICAL APOCALYPTIC PREDICTION THAT FAILS TO DELIVER.  what proof do i have?  i'd suggest that we meet back here in 10 or 15 years to see if the climate is on the brink of disaster‚Äîor that we're just 10 or 15 years older."

How about educating yourself and then you will understand that the difference between historic natural climate change and the type of climate change we are witnessing today is the RATE of change is unprecedented has never before been observed. The RATE of change of global temperature increase is directly proportional to the rate of CO2 emissions. In the last 10 years, 8 years broke all previous global temperature records. 2017 was the  hottest year since records began, 2016 was the hottest before that. 2018 already looks set to beat all records yet again. The rate of global annual temperature increase is directly proportional to the rate we are putting CO2 into the atmosphere. Last year we put 10.5 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, the most ever. Think about that! Also 56,000,000,000 tons of Antarctic ice has been lost to the sea last year alone.

"B V.","2018-06-02T10:15:39Z","Al Clark -> You have a point, but this layer still has a large volume. The surface of the earth is very large and volume still = surface area x height. Volcanoes and other natural processes have a much larger effect on this layer than human activity. The earth adapts to this activity by adjusting factors like cloud cover and rainfall. The earth has been here six billion years and has survived meteor bombardment, glaciers, and huge volcanic explosions (look up Toba - it nearly wiped out humanity and many other species)."
"B V.","2018-06-02T10:00:24Z","Al Clark -> I know how to think. You should try it sometime. By your attitude, I'd guess that you've gone to a college run by a bunch of Leftist lunatics that filled you with delusions of adequacy and made you feel good about it. You probably went there long enough to accumulate a mountain of debt and no job skills. All you have to do is look at the history of the earth. All you need to know is that the earth had no ice up until 30 million years ago.  The earth had no permanent ice at the poles until the beginning of the Pleistocene era starting 2.5 million years ago.  Since then, glaciation has been the normal state of the earth and warming periods are the exception.  Over the past 450,000 years, there have been four major glaciation periods. The last one ended about 10,000 years ago. Since then there have been short-term warming and cooling periods.  The Roman times were warmer than today. There was a major cooling period during the Middle Ages during which many villages in the Alps were destroyed by advancing glaciers. During the European Renaissance there was another warm period until the ""Little Ice Age"" occurred in the 17th & 18th centuries. Since then the climate has been warming. If this pattern continues, the next major climate event will be another glaciation age."

Observations.  I've been observing glaciers receding for decades.  Has nothing to do with pollution.  The earth has been naturally warming for centuries.  But since the industrial revolution pumped billions of cubic feet of pollution into the atmosphere which acts like shade over water,  it takes water longer to evaporate and form rain clouds.

"SharkyJ17","2018-05-24T02:41:49Z","I'm going to include the points of time in the video that I have issues with; this is going to be a long comment (I will use evidence, and project absolutely no bias and no assumptions, just facts/observations). Also I'd appreciate any agreements/counters, so reply if you want. Here we go...

0:05 This is an environmental discussion, why is her first question about politics?
0:18 His response and interruption to her question is very explosive, there's no reason for heated discussions over a purely scientific (and not political) topic. 0:29 ""We're changing the gas..."" is a ridiculous statement, but it does not justify ""No, you're full of shit, sit down."" However, if you research what is happening in the environment, you'd know what she's talking about, even if she doesn't word it correctly.
0:33 Maybe this is towards the end of a presentation and tensions are already high, but both of their responses are unwarranted.

1:50 - 2:30 The statement about examining ice cores is correct. But he said, ""at 275,000 years ago this was the temperature, blah blah blah."" Scientists examine the amount of carbon dioxide molecules that are trapped inside the bubbles in the ice, but this method can be inaccurate because the snow layer takes a while to become solid ice deep under the top layer. This means that the gas has plenty of time to diffuse out of the snow before it becomes trapped in solid ice. Consequently, that means the gas trapped inside the ice is younger than the ice surrounding it (but that statement is not true in all places, it is only true in places that don't get snowfall very often). Another thing that is important here is that he uses the difference of 275 thousand to 55 thousand years ago to describe a tiny increase in temperature. Her question is about CO2. He doesn't answer her question, and if he knew anything about the CO2 emissions she is trying to address, then he would know that the problem began with the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s, and that he should be talking about the CO2 and not the temperature of the air. The truth is, there is a big difference in CO2 concentration in the air before and after the Industrial Revolution. Next thing: a NASA graph organized in 2011 shows that the average temperature of the world was the same as previous decades in the 1940s and 1950s, but began to increase at a much steeper angle after the 1960s. As of 2011, it was .51 C warmer on average than it was in 1940 and previous decades. Now, he is correct about the Earth's temperatures being cyclical, or rising and falling in a cycle. What he says at 2:00 is slightly misleading because he doesn't say the temp of the world 275,000 years ago before saying that 55,000 years ago the world was 2 degrees C hotter than today. If he is comparing 275k ya vs 55k ya, then that means that it took 220 thousand years to raise 2 degrees C, which is a rate of 0.0000090909 degrees C increase per year. In just 50 years, 1961- 2011, it raised .51 degrees C. That's an average of 0.01 degrees per year, which is much much faster. It's so fast in comparison that it can't possibly be natural. Yes, global temperature is cyclical, but not at the rate shown in the past 50 years. 

2:36 ""It's not a fart in the wind."" I don't understand this metaphor: ""a fart in the wind"" is supposed to dissipate quickly, meaning it has no effect. If it is not a fart in the wind, then it has a lasting impact. In other news, farts aren't super relevant to adult conversations.
2:40 Earth is not 13.8 billion years old, the universe is that old. Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and WE have not been on it for that long. The oldest cells are around 4 billion years old, modern humans are only around 200,000 years old. And civilization is only 4,000 years old.
2:45 Ok so this is the only time I'll be biased. Planet Earth isn't miserable, it's beautiful. I'm only biased because I live here.
2:57 ""In 25,000 years, it's most likely not going to be a problem."" There's a very large possibility that humans won't be on the planet in 25,000 years. We need to focus on the problems that we have NOW that will affect the next thousand years, not 25 thousand.

3:00 - 5:00 He sounds like he's leading up to a good rebuttal until he uses bankers as his evidence. He says if Global Warming and rising sea levels were real, bankers would not finance the expensive construction of millions of homes in coastal areas. It would make the investment ""fuck all"" (something a high school student would say). He believes that bankers and home building entrepreneurs care about the rising sea levels. These people know there is a demand for housing in coastal areas, to they build houses to make money. If there was no demand, they wouldn't build the houses because they would lose money. Similarly, banks only exist because of interest rates. That's the only way banks make money, if they couldn't make money off of interest, they would be giving away money out of the goodness of their hearts. That doesn't sound like something they would do. They don't care about the rising sea levels, they care about creating a booming local economy for the next decade or so. If sea levels rise, they could just take their money they made with them and leave, with or without the submerged homeowners. They don't care about the environment or the danger, they just push it away like the rest of the population.
4:16 It sounds like he is trying to make up statistics as he goes when he says ""Not one single investment prospectus written since 2 thousand and... this century has alluded to global warming!"" This observation leads me to distrust some of his previous statistics, which haven't sounded plausible to begin with. Who's the fraud?
4:10 , 4:24 , 4:34 -  There's no reason to get so angry, or to use that language to develop what should be, a formal and polite thesis.
4:58 ""The banks of the world know it's not gonna happen."" What do they know? They are trained and practiced in banking, not environmental protection/analysis.
4:42 ""I'm jealous of the vice President, Gore... I'm jealous he came up with the scam before I did."" Dan's jealous of the man who created a scam to make money, and that doesn't make him sound very trustworthy as a public figure. He's hurting his own cause and reputation even more than when he uses the phrase ""mother fucker"" every 10 to 15 seconds.

There is something important to ponder about Al Gore's ""scam"". He said in 2006 that we only had a decade left to save the world from global warming. That statement, in my opinion, is ridiculous. However, Al Gore stated scientific evidence that humans are affecting the Earth's natural patterns, and these effects will eventually make Earth uninhabitable if they aren't stopped. Imagine if there were no humans on Earth in 2150. I don't think that environmental emergencies will be the end of the race, but they will certainly affect us until the only thing we can do is stop all industry. In a world relying on industry, that is not something we will be able to to. We have to act now. Just because Al Gore said we had one decade doesn't mean that he is lying or scamming us. He is telling the ""Inconvenient Truth"" that people don't want to listen to because they are already too wrapped up in their own struggle to make money in this economy. 

Dan Pena doesn't have sufficient evidence to prove anything. He believes that people who are trained to handle money care about the environment. They don't, they just make money. The goal of society is to make money, that is the biggest struggle, and it leaves no time for us to realize that you can't make money without a planet to live on.

Most people hear about fatal car accidents and they feel sorry. But inside them, they could care less because it is not a personal problem to them. They feel like it could never happen to them. People always talk about the future of global warming as if it is still a long way off, and it'll never affect them. People always say the world will end, but I won't be here to see it. They are pushing away issues to the next generation, to the generation that may have to deal with the end of the world. But the time to act is now, and even if you don't believe global warming is real, there are plenty of issues that are results of man's industry. The power to save the world relies on each individual person who needs to break the mindsets of infallibility, invulnerability, and incapability. We can save the world if we start now.

"EF M","2018-05-13T00:51:59Z","CO2 is a greenhouse gas. That is it both absorbs and releases infrared photons. Once released, there is one chance in 41,253 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 70% of the Earth, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate the surface, instead will excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 40% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity. The increase in temperature due to the increase of H2O and CO2 gases is approximately .9C at present. Because it takes a tremendous amount of time for the oceans to heat, it will take centuries for the Earth to reach temperature equilibrium. If we continue to inject CO2 into the atmosphere, that heating process will continue to accelerate."

This old fraud here is doing what most climate deniers do. They over simplify the issue, exaggerate the consequences, then laugh and shake their heads at the stupidity of the statement they just made as if this some how disproves the massive body of evidence. As for banks not financing coastal regions, he is probably aware that the number he quoted of 10 feet in the next decade is pure BS, such increases are not expected until near the end of the century if not later. So of fucking course the banks will continue to invest, knowing full well that they have decades to receive repayments. Those getting screwed are those who buy them, not those who build them.

The whole Universe has been around for 13.8 billion years, we have been on this planet for about 300,000 years.
HE is the one who needs to get his facts straight.
 Another reason he's full of shit is to do with his statements about real estate agaents and banks.
Real estate agents don't give a shit if the oceans rise 10 feet in the next 50 years, that event is covered in ""an act of god"".
 The banks don't give a shit about the money they lend, as long as they get their repayments, or not! If something goes wrong, there are insurances to cover that.
 Why do you think that only ONE banker went to Gaol for the GFC?

 Global Warming is a fact. It is a proven fact, and very simply done.

 12,000 years ago, the world was in the grip of a glaciation where there were extensive ice sheets covering vast areas of the world. Then it all stated to end with temperatures slowly rising and the ice sheets melting.
 The world began to enter an interglacial period.
And it is STILL going on.

The world IS warming up.

GLOBAL WARMING!!

This planet has been through 5 seperate periods of glaciation (ice ages), and in between, (interglacials), the world warmed up and it was called Global Warming.

 How much effect humans are having on the process, is another question.

 I don't believe that the oceans will rise very much in the next 50 years, certainly not 10 feet/3.05 meters. They might rise by 100 to 200 millimeters, I'm not sure.

The name of the game is diversion of money."
"EF M","2018-10-07T22:57:19Z","Let us now talk about the multiplier effect. If we build breeder reactors first and use that electricity to produce solar panels, the multiplier effect would be 2000*9=18,000 to 1. Considering a coal-fired power plant has a ratio of about 80 to 1, that figures out to be about 18,000/80=225 times the increase in efficiency. Doing so would flatten out the hierarchies of the world, creating vastly greater independence worldwide.  This would accomplish exactly what the murderous communists attempted but badly failed at."
"EF M","2018-10-07T22:56:47Z","Since there seems to be an issue with fossil fuels, the question is what to do about it. This is my answer. If anyone has a different solution, I'd like to hear it. Let's begin with BTU in vs BTUs out by the energy source.
Corn 1.3
Solar PV 9
Natural gas 10
Windmills 18
Light Water Reactors 80
Coal 80
Hydropower 100
LFTR and TWR 2,000

Now consider deaths per terrawatt.
Coal 161
Oil 36
Biomass 12
Peat 12
Natural gas 4
Solar PV .44
Hydropower .10
Light water reactors .04
LFTR and TWR .003

As you can see LFTRs and TWRs are the most cost efficient and safest energy supply possible at this time. We should easily be able to reach $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour. That brings the price of everything down substantially. Building small mass-produced modular breeder reactors would also make windmills and solar panels exceptionally cost-effective. We could have the population producing the majority of their own energy leaving nuclear energy for industry. Or we can continue with this absurd global warming debate."
"EF M","2018-10-07T22:56:14Z","Because of the additional infrared photons are increasing evaporation in the oceans, it is also increasing evaporation on the continents. On top of that, as the temperature rises, absolute humidity goes up, but because warmer air can hold more moisture, relative humidity will go down. That means less rain on the continents, but when it does rain, there will tend to be more cloudbursts. This correlates into more droughts, heat waves, and erosion. This is already occurring in the United States.  As the temperature increases, the Hadley cell grows in size pushing the Mexican and Sahara deserts further north moving, into Europe and central North America.  As the winds come back across the Mediterranean Sea it will cause the Sahara Desert to become lush and green again.  Unfortunately, the temperature will be too warm for human habitation."
"EF M","2018-10-07T22:55:03Z","As the atmosphere warms, the differential temperature decreases between the ocean's surface and the atmosphere, blocking the ocean from releasing its heat. That is where 93% of the additional heat is being stored. This additional heat in the oceans will not only undermine the ice caps but will allow vastly larger hurricanes to form and travel at much greater distances. The imminent threat isn't sea level rise but a future of massive storm surges. This website gives a more detailed explanation.

Now if you know the science behind climate change, you recognize the red herring he brings out here. The fact that it has been warmer and colder before does not mean that humans have no influence on the climate. 

The narrative I encounter more than any is: ""Nature changed the temperature before, the temperature is changing now, there for nature is changing the temperature."" That is a false equivalence.

"rangerri","2018-05-06T05:57:10Z","I have one question,
If every scientific report published about global warming claims that it is real, then why do you believe these idiots in the media and politics.

They believe that global warming is not an issue and we are wasting our money into it.

But think about it, if a professional who spent their entires lives into their research and rely only on true facts to keep their career successful, they have more to lose if they lie about their facts.  They‚Äôre 2 types of people into this situation, scientists who want to help the world, then there is the media who rely and care about money.

Some people think investing into stopping global warming is a waste of money, but if you think about it, where do you get your money from? Venus? Mars? Earth is our only home and probably will be for the rest of our lives, everything we built was built from everything earth has gave us.

*A Definition For People Who Rather Not Read the Content Above*
Earth is where we work to earn money, and if we lose earth, we practically lose our only way to earn money, which hurts the economy a lot more than stopping climate change before it gets more dangerous than it already is."

we need to pump more O2 in the air, and the best way to do this is to plant more trees
CO2 leads to warmer climate  
but not to the scale we are lead to believe 
it's simple, the more trees we cut down, the more we destroy the atmosphere, 
however, there are trillions of trees on this Earth, in fact, there are more trees on this Earth today than there are stars in the milky way galaxy, there are an approximate 3 trillion trees, so Global warming is a very minor impact of deforestation, the other pollutants that we humans pump out in the air are through burning of fossil fuels, 

other than that, Climate change is real, but it's so slow and Human impact is so little, that in order for all the ice to melt, we humans would have to continuously burn tons and tons of fossil fuels and cut down billions of trees for the next thousands of years"

He failed to mention (what the scientists undoubtedly also told him) that the warm phase of the cycle that we are currently entering is occurring more rapidly than it has in the past. This is very likely caused by man-made carbon emmissions in the atmosphere produced since the industrial revolution which have exacerbated the process. The precise measurement of the human contribution to the rising sea temperatures, green house gases, melting poles can be debated, but the science shows these things ARE happening. The interglacial cycle (global warming/cooling) will proceed regardless. To dismiss this as a 'scam' is foolish."

For mother Earth water levels 70 meters higher then today would mean less then nothing.
To us people living now and the next few hundred years to come a rise of a mere 7 meters would be close to Armageddon.
Hell during late cretaceous age temperatures were some 10 degrees higher there was a forest at the south pole then, so what? 
It is the short term effects of climate change that are OUR problem hell we are heading for a glaciation in the next 1000-10000 years or so.

in the end, CO2 output has generally been bad for human health, not just the planet. I would argue that climate change is being seen as the biggest issue, while I would argue that it is the heavy mineral increase in oceans, the drop in freshwater quality in many nations,  eg: nitrification of lakes creating algae blooms like cyanobacteria and suffocating other lake life. these other environmental issues I would argue are far more important."

""The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are melting and in some places the
seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce
Department yesterday from Consulafft, at Bergen, Norway.
Reports from fishermen, seal hunters, and explorers all point to a radical
change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the
Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been
met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes.
Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm.
Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the
report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely
disappeared.
Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast
shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north,
are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds. Within a few years it
is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most
coastal cities uninhabitable.""

"Aidan Tisch","2018-04-12T22:43:00Z","The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.5 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year ‚Äî from January through September, with the exception of June ‚Äî were the warmest on record for those respective months.
The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005.Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world ‚Äî including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa. Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier. Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century. Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades. The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year."

Yet at the same time they also say global warming will cause dry lands and drought. Well here's some science one learns as a 10 year old. Warm water means evaporation, evaporation means clouds, clouds means rain. Rain means no drought. Clouds also cause wind. Wind causes hurricanes. Heat does not cause hurricanes.

Global Warming - Ten Talking Points 
 People with advanced science degrees, most on the government dole, claim rising CO2 in the air every year will is had its hottest year on record after the year 2000 -- most states had their hottest year in the 1930's, and some in 1998. If global warming is real, then why is it not reflected in the record highs of individual states? (Alaska and Hawaii don't have over 100 years of data needed to be included in this analysis). 
 That has not been happening, but the predictions have continued for over 30 years! 
 . Here are ten examples of how the alarmists have been wrong: 
 . 
 (1) CO2 rose from 1940 to 1976, but the average temperature fell in those years -- there was no warming! 
 . 
 (2) CO2 rose from 1998 to 2014, but the average temperature fell in those years -- there was no warming! (Accurate global weather satellite data used for 1979 to 2014). 
 . 
 (3) When raw data are smoothed to see the trend, there has been no warming in the past 18 years. (RSS weather satellite global data) 
 .
 Note: Warmists ignore accurate weather satellite data, as if they do not exist, in favor of non-global, inaccurate surface measurements with a pro-warming bias. Surface measurements are severely biased by the local warming effect of economic growth: Cement, asphalt and bricks used to build new roads, parking lots, and buildings near suburban and urban temperature stations, absorb heat during the day and release it at night -- causing nighttime warming not measured at temperature stations properly sited in a consistent environment of grass and trees. 
 . 
 In the US, properly sited temperature stations reflect half the warming measured by improperly sited stations affected by economic growth around them (aka ""urban heat island effect""). 
 . 
 Over 6,000 land temperature stations were active in the mid-1960s, but over 80% of them are no longer in use today. Stations no longer in use were mainly rural, and at higher latitudes and altitudes -- dropping those stations, which tended to be in cooler locations, raises the average temperature calculations, creating a pro-global warming bias in surface data not seen in weather balloon and weather satellite data.
 . 
 Even with those pro-warming biases, the warmists' beloved surface data still show no warming trend for over 12 years! 
 . 
 (4) Warmists claim the Earth is warming year-after-year, but temperature records from US states tell a different story: 
 - Only one of the contiguous 48 US states had its hottest year on record after the year 2000 -- most states had their hottest year in the 1930's, and some in 1998. If global warming is real, then why is it not reflected in the record highs of individual states? (Alaska and Hawaii don't have over 100 years of data needed to be included in this analysis). 

 . 
 (5) Southern Hemisphere sea ice area has repeatedly set new records in 2014, which is obviously caused by global cooling in that half of Earth (satellite data first collected in 1979). 
 . 
 (6) Several recent winters have been among the coldest in centuries in the United Kingdom, and continental Europe, and the 2013-2014 winters was one of the coldest and snowiest in decades for much of the United States and Canada. 
 . 
 We've been having fewer severe storms on Earth, not more:

 (7) 2014 is near a 30-year low in worldwide hurricane energy (measured by ‚Äúaccumulated cyclone energy,‚Äù or ACE index). 
 . 
 (8) Land falling hurricanes in the US have been in a downward trend since 1945. 
 . 
 (9) It has been 3,310 days since the last Category 3 or stronger hurricane hit the US mainland (Katrina in 2005), as of November 18, 2014 -- this is the longest stretch (by more than 1,000 days) without a strong hurricane since records began in 1900. 
 .
 (10) This year's Atlantic hurricane season is the least active in 30 years.

 . Computer game forecasts are not science -- they are inaccurate climate astrology. 
 .
 The false predictions of a coming climate catastrophe are no science -- they are a political tool used to scare people into giving their government a lot more power ... especially the power to tax corporations for their energy use.
 .
 Men who claim there will be a disaster of some sort unless everyone does as they say, is a centuries-old political tool (trick) used by kings, politicians, and religious leaders to gain power and control people.
 .
 The claim that computer games can predict a coming climate catastrophe is the biggest scam in human history. Sadly, the truth is that more CO2 in the air greens the Earth and has little or no effect on the average temperature.
 .
 There have been several ice ages on Earth with more CO2 in the air than we have now. 
 .
 The first 100 ppmv of CO2 in the air has a huge greenhouse effect.
 .
 But increasing CO2 from 400 ppmv (currently) to 500 ppmv will have such a small greenhouse effect that it may not be measureable.
 .
 Other factors, whether known or unknown, have a MUCH LARGER effect on the average temperature -- that's why the large increase of CO2 in the past 18 years (18 years per RSS satellite data -- 12 years for pro warming-bias surface data) has caused no warming of the average temperature ... nor did the large rise of CO2 from 1940 to 1976 cause any warming.
 .
 97% of climate model simulations predict more warming than has actually happened (warming from 1976 to 1998), and 100% of the climate models failed to predict the lack of warming in the past 18 years."

So the US govt and the State of Florida have put up PUBLIC money to assure the private insurers that they won't go bankrupt if your home floods along with the rest of Florida. It is estimated that with one good hit by the right Hurricane, the State of Florida would go bankrupt. So, Pena is wrong: you can get a bank loan for a house in London or Florida.  But only with flood insurance, and that insurance is already being publicly subsidized: the PUBLIC goes bankrupt if London floods, not the banks. NEVER the banks.  And as long as that situation continues, the banks will continue to loan money, right up to the moment London slips under the sea."

The study does not take into account the additional damage done by increasing UVB/UVC radiation levels on female fertility and male sperm motility. Note:- A 57% decline in sperm concentration occurred over a 38-year period ending in 2011 among men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.The EPA has taken down ALL information regarding the UV Index and UV radiation warning system."

The oceans contribute the vast majority of the CO2 in our atmosphere, so as the temps rise, there's more evaporation, thus more CO2.  The single greatest predictor of our weather is the sun, thru solar activity and cosmic rays, which increase cloud cover.  During the Little Ice Age of medieval Europe, astronomers saw very few sun spots.  As the spots increase, we get warmer.  Greenland has been farmed before during one of these warm periods, in fact, warm periods have been a time of growth and plenty, for advances in civilization, it's the cold periods that are the killers.  CO2 makes up less than half of a percent of our atmosphere, humans contribute a tiny fraction of that one half percent.  This crap that CO2 is the single most important driver of our weather is just that... Crap.  Of course we should take care of the planet and try to keep it clean for future generations, but driving people out of business and jobs with regulations and taxes isn't the way to do that.  Nor is trying to force ridiculously expensive and ineffective things like solar panels on developing countries.  The climate change furor is mostly a way for scientists to get funding, it's become its own multi billion dollar industry.  Now if you want to study anything, you have to include ""climate change"" in your proposal to get money.  We'd be better off pouring all those funds into an effective anti asteroid or comet program, since we know they often can't detect them until they're very close, and they actually DO pose a threat to the survival of our species.  Just ask the dinosaurs.  Oh wait, you can't, they were WIPED OUT BY AN ASTEROID HIT."

Again: I'm not saying I am absolutely right. So if you want to correct me or answer me then answer in a constructive way or just FUCK OFF.

First: Banks create money by giving credit to people/companies. So if you buy a house and get money from the bank, the moment you sign the papers money is created by the bank. They don't have the money physically laying around. This means that the money you borrow did not exist before. Banks give out multiple times more money than the actually have. Think about that. 
So basically the interest you pay for the money is what the bank lives off if you like. This means that they if let's say in ten years or whenever the sea levels WOULD rise and England and so on would be under water the banks would still have made money by giving you the credit. Or doesn't it? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Then second: If you say banks know all the shit and would not give out money if they knew it would happen.
Why the hell would all the companies (like car producers etc.) around the world pay millions and millions for research and design of new ways to reduce CO2 emissions etc. 
Are they dumb and only banks are the genius motherfuckers who know everything? I don't think so. 

Correct me if I'm wrong."

Are all of you global warming alarmists driving electric cars to work every day or are you driving a car with an internal combustion engine? Do  you have solar panels on your home? Suppose mankind is responsible for global warming and suppose we could fix it? what would it take? We'd have to eliminate almost all  motor vehicles with internal combustion engines. We'd have to stop burning coal! We'd have to stop burning heating oil!We'd have to pretty much go back  to the lifestyle of 200 year ago. Our current way of  life requires enormous  amounts of energy. Can we get enough of it from solar and wind? What are the environmental impact of these energy sources do  you know? Solar panels wind turbines and other electronic components require manufacturing methods that cause pollution. If we can stop global warming and we intend to do it it's going to take sacrifice! A lot of sacrifice! So  what are you sacrificing now to save the planet? So what if wind and solar are not enough? then we need nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is neither clean nor cheap! It cost more than any other power source. Also we are already  in danger of major radioactive contamination from  accidents in the plants or waste containment areas! There's no easy answers for any of this stuff. If you think paying more taxes is going to solve the problem you obviously do not understand how governments work. So my question for you fear mongers is what sacrifices are you currently making and how much more are you willing to sacrifice. If you are not willing to give up your big SUV and drive an electric car then you are part of the problem not part of the solution!"

The earth has cyclic events that cause warming and cooling and we don't have the means to stop it. Getting paranoid is not going to help anything. If your worried about sea level rise I suggest you move away from the coast. Buy real estate at higher altitudes and wait for the big profits you will make when people start relocating. If you live near the coast don't buy a home rent one. Buy real estate farther from the coast to  cover your ass if and when you have to relocate. Stop  being a cry baby and stop dreaming that the the government is going to do something to  stop it. That doesn't work.

Every climate scientist, and everyone who understands climate science knows that there are cyclical contributions to climate and sea levels.

The glaciation periods are due to changes in orbital parameters. The periods of these cycles are in tens and hundreds of thousands of years. The interglacial period we are in has given relatively stable temperatures and sea levels for the last 10,000 years, during whicch agricultural regions were developed in regions where the climate was suitable and cities and other infrastructure grew up to support those regions.

Since the industrial revolution, humans have been adding CO2 to the atmosphere with the result that warming unprecedented in human history has occured and continues with a resultant change for agricultural regions and sea levels that are occuring over time spans of decades and a few centuries.

If human civilization is around in 10,000 years when the next glaciation period is due, people may well have to burn coal to raise the temperature.

As far as what the banks are or are not doing. These are the geniuses who  brought us the Great Recession. The CEO's are intersted in short term profit, which will get them their next bonus. And here in Australia institutions are already being warned by regulatory authorites that they  face lawsuits for not adequately taking into account and disclosing the risks from climate change and how they intend to deal with those risks. Florida is already seeing the effects of sea level rise.

Climate science is almost 200 years old, and evidence had been acccumulating to the extent that the Johnson administration warned of the consequences  long before Al Gore, who is not a scientist, ever made his movie.

In 1938, Callendar made a prediction of the temperature rise with doubling of cO2 concentration which is in agreement with the IPCC range.

http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/callendar_1938.pdf

In 1981, at a time when the northern hemisphere was cooling and the global mean temperature still below the values of the early 1940s, Hansen et al confidently predicted a rise in temperature due to increasing CO2 emissions that has stood the test of time.

http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/04/evaluating-a-1981-temperature-projection/

Data since 1958, when Maunal Loa CO2 data began being collected, gives a rise in temperature of 3 C with doubling of CO2 concentration, in the middle of the IPCC range, even though a reduction in solar intensity and increased particulate pollution from China and India has been making a cooling contribution to the observed global temperature.

Nope but the reason why this crap is pseudo science is the way the numbers are manipulated. The datasets. Add together numbers 1-5 and you get 15 average 3. Now take off the '1' and the average becomes 3.5 and you get global warming. You see? Nope still struggling then read the following and weep. Comes from a long article I knocked together some time back.

In 2009 there was the Climategate scandal when emails from the University of East Anglia climatic research unit confirmed Dr James Hansen (a climatologist who ran NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space studies (GISS) and  Al Gore‚Äôs closest scientific ally), Philip Jones, Michael Mann et al were involved in fabricating evidence of climate change. More emails followed in 2011. Meanwhile NASA had been busy fabricating data throughout 2007-2014. All this involved massaging figures, altering data sets and so on. A tweak here, a tweak there and voila you have a hockey stick. The GISS were one of the four official sources of temp data on which IPCC relied. An organisation run by a political body whose contributors were in the main not climate experts or indeed scientists. 

https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-09-19-climate-change-science-implodes-as-ipcc-climate-models-found-to-be-totally-wrong-temperatures-arent-rising-as-predicted-hoax-unraveling.html#

In 2013 UN IPCC scientists reported a ‚Äòpause‚Äô or ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô in global warming in the period since 1998. In 2015 back came Thomas Karl who was director of the NCEI part of NOAA and we get the ‚Äòpause buster‚Äô report just in time for the UN climate conference in Paris claiming the pause/slowdown in global warming never existed and world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. On the 22 April 2016 175 countries signed up to the agreement. at a cost of $1 trillion a year. Job done. Didn't any of these clowns check the facts first? 

http://www.dailywire.com/news/9767/9-things-you-need-know-about-climate-change-hoax-aaron-bandler# 

Dr John J Bates erstwhile colleague of the above at NCEI had a lot to say about all this earlier this year. Data sets were seriously flawed and were never approved or verified (no peer review). Software was afflicted with devastating bugs giving different readings every time the same data was run; unreliable methods were used. None of the data on which the paper was based was properly archived, so no chance of the results ever being verified Oh yes and the computer used to process the software has suffered a complete failure. Whatever that means. Also when needed large adjustments to the raw data and substantial changes in successive datasets versions were made or the data was just plain ignored. I mean why not?

Oh and to head off any other trash, there was a good reason why it was changed from 'Global warming' to 'Climate change', market research. Our climate is changing, hell we are in an  inter glacial period. Of course it's bloody changing. Google 'climate 20,000 years ago'. A long time? Not in the general scheme of things. We only got civilised 10,000 odd years back. Google 'civilization 10,000 years ago'. Mike:) Peace love and happiness:)"

They begged for deregulation promising us that only good things would happen. despite warnings they got their way and in 2008 the banks crashed and now we have a debt mountain that is an existential threat to our economic system.

We know that the climate has varied wildly over the planet's past, as Dan Pena points out. It should be noted that scientists do have a pretty good understanding of the mechanisms that have driven previous changes in the climate. Precession, changes in solar output, variations in the Earths orbit and tectonic activity are to name but a few. At the moment their is no scientific consensus around a natural alternative that challenges the unanimity of the man made global warming theories. In fact it is not clear if the crux of the deniers arguments are that warming is happening and that it is not man made or that it isn't happening at all. Dan Pena alludes to this contradiction. In one breath he is telling us that ice cores clearly demonstrate that the climate has changed in the past and in the next he is telling us that rich people are building condos next to the sea, suggesting that the climate isn't about to change any time soon. Which is the pertinent argument?

Global warming may well be a scam designed to rob us all of our taxes. However this argument is neutralized by the equivalent evidence that well financed and powerful interests have sought to undermine the arguments made by global warming scientists. The continued extraction and use of oil maintains the status quo, and underpins the dollar. Multi billion dollar wars are fought to control oil, is it not beyond the realms of possibility that a conspiracy also exists to deny global warming?

We have no idea what the tolerances of our planet are. We do not know if the atmosphere and the seas can absorb all the CO2 we omit without consequence. It is up to the deniers to prove that their is no limit if we are going to keep burning Oil until it runs out."

"Donald Duck","2018-03-02T18:55:43Z","There is a human species on this planet that I have named Homo Hillbilius Rednecis. This special branch of evolutionary adaption to the United States of Corporate America has learned to survive in the harsh climate of profit maximization by exclusively absorbing intellectual food from corporate interests and extremophile religious doctrine.

Homo Hilbilius is characterized by the worldview that he was especially created by a higher being in order to have the world's natural resources including all wild life to his exlusive use to whatever purpose. He calls this ""freedom"".  

He lives in a complex symbiosis with corporations and religious organisations. He helps them to maximize their profits and even protects them from environmental regulations, science and gun restrictions. In return they guarantee his ""freedom"".

Hilbilius Rednecis has developed an immune system that makes him impenetrable to critical thinking and scientific reasoning which enables him to thrive on dogmatic religious thinking and to feed off xeno- and homophobia.

His natural enemies are environmentalists, atheists and people with a different world view in general.

Lately corporate america has come under threat from a global change of political climate towards sustainability. The petrol industry, the very root of this delicate eco-system is under attack by climate action, renewable energy sources, electric vehicles and even bio-plastics. Every day Homo Hillbilius Rednecis is losing habitat and is, despite of his high reproduction rates, in danger of becoming an extinct species.

I have contacted the World Wildlife Fund about the matter and learned that due to the predatory, parasitic and inherently violent nature of this specific sub-human species it would be too difficult to keep enough specimen in captivity for breeding purposes. With their numbers dwindling, Homo Hilbilius Rednecis's fate is now hanging by a thread. 

Maybe we should do what Hilbilius himself would do with endangered species: 
Let them adapt to the human environment or go extinct."

The earth has been cooling for over 18 years and is expected to keep cooling for another 35 years or more. Most of the temp measurements were taken from thermometers placed in the middle of acres and acres of hot asphalt and concrete (AIRPORTS). Pretty much the hottest place in any given city. 
And lets imagine that all their trillions in taxes, fines, fees and punishing policies were allowed to go through.  Taxing people trillions of dollars won't cool the planet one degree. Try it yourself!  The next time you hop in your car on a hot summers day instead of turning the Air Conditioning on --- try putting a $20 bill on your dash and see if that cools your car so you can stand to be in it. Maybe you have a little baby in the car seat and it is a really hot 95 degree day so try putting a hundred dollar bill on the dash and see if that cools your car!  
The most bizarre thing about the global warming global police state scam is they say they plan to give trillions to undeveloped nations in Africa and other places. If you give trillions of dollars to a poor country in Africa the very first thing they are going to do is buy millions of cars that will pollute the atmosphere even more and cause more global warming and then they will start building homes and buildings with air conditioning that will pollute the atmosphere. 

The Global Warming Scam is a hoax designed to control the earth's wealth, production and enslave the people of the earth in a one world communist police state. It does zero to cool, warm or do anything to the earth's temperature."

>> Global warming is a bigger fraud then the gas shortage in the 60s and 70s
According to my information the shortage of gasoline was caused by an embargo that the oil producing arab countries were putting on the United States to punish them for supporting Israel. Naturally prices went up high. I can't see a sign of a fraud here. 

>>  according the them the world would be out of fuel by the year 2000
I guess, ""them"" would be the experts who were warning about peak oil. Their predictions did not take into consideration modern extraction techniques like fracking or tar sands, naturally. Therefore they did not come true. But again: I can't see a deliberate attempt to scam the population here either.

However, what I can see is the following:

A global oil industry with a budget easily surpassing the ones of most nations in the world desperately trying to conserve the status quo against the global awareness that climate change happens, that it is man-made and that something has to be done about it. And against the fast growing competition of clean renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

Big oil has become so desperate, in fact, that it spends hundreds of millions of dollars per year in order to manipulate politics to their liking and media to spread misinformation about climate change. This has gone so far that the highest positions in politics - even the president himself - are now pro fossil fuel and anti-renewables as well as in complete climate denial.

Now the government of the United States is ignoring the warnings of its own advisors on climate science.
The head of the Environmental Protection Agency thinks that the air is too clean.
And, of course, the Trump administration keeps building oil pipelines with tax payer's money 
- while putting taxes on imported solar panels to hurt the american clean energy industry.

And this is where I see more than just a major scam, but an illegal take over of the government by a specific part of the industry in violation of civil rights and against the wishes of the vast majority of american citizens in order to protect the profits of a handful of oil barons who do not care that their doings are endangering not only the lives of our children and their children, but the survival of the human species on earth as a whole.

""They"", to the contrary of most people who write their comments on this blog, are not some mysterious new world order illuminaties, but very well known CEO's and chair men in very prominent positions like the Koch brothers. And ""they"" know very well what they are doing. 

Therefore, from my point of view, it is a shame that people in this blog who do not know the difference between climate change and global warming are uttering with so much conviction that climate change was a hoax."

It takes tens of thousands of years to get from one ice age to the next within a natural cycle. But we are changing the composition of the earth's atmosphere much, much faster. Compare it to going in a car with 100 km/h and breaking it slowly down to a halt and stopping the car within just one second. Eco systems need time to adjust to changes. And, according to climatologists, this sudden change in the atmosphere is going to cause climate disruptions - which means more and stronger hurricanes and snow storms, extreme changes in temperature, extremely long draughts in one area and repeated floodings in others.

Bad wheather as never been good for agriculture and changes in temperature and acidity of sea water are not good for fish populations. Moving billions of people from one country to another within the same century is neither good for world peace, nor economies.

Politics? Yes, of course.  
Responsible politicians are working towards regulations to reduce the burning of fossil fuels in order to avert the dangers of climate change and to make a shift from a fossil fuel driven economy to a sustainable one. Fossil fuel companies see this as a real threat to their very existence and are spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year to influence politics in their favour and propagate climate denial through media channels.

Who would you trust more to say the truth? 97% of all climatologists in the world or the Koch brothers?
When I compare reports about climate change to those made to deny climate change I perceive a clear difference between the intellectual level and the way how the information is presented. 

I don't think I need to tell you which is an honest documentary and which one is propaganda."
"merelyanopinion","2018-03-13T00:18:24Z","+Jalen Davis The governments of the world know about the fossil fuels running out and are using the global warming garbage as a Trojan horse to reduce oil consumption etc and do as you've suggested go all renewable energy sources. Doing it this way avoids scaring the sheep, sorry public.  Since at the moment they don't have a bloody clue how to run everything on batteries, from container ships, to boeings, Hercules planes, Galaxies, tractors, combined harvesters etc etc. I mean you have cars, nice town things all batteries running on tarmac but that's not the same as tractors, tanks, boeings etc.  So that screws up globalisation, intensive agriculture, projection of power and so on. And that's real scary stuff. 
Now China have all that sorted, seriously they've thought about all this from the time they marched into Tibet. Getting their hands on all the ten major rive systems in Asia, which they are now starting to dam. I mean what a surprise.
Their belt and road project gives them access to all the asian market, 60% of the earth's people over whom they have control of their water supply. Access by renewable resources, by road and boat using of course 'solar sails'. Within 20 yrs there should be the next development using sails impregnated with chemicals which absorb ultraviolet light to generate electricity. In the meanwhile cargo ships are being developed, not quite the same as container ships though pretty close. But with 60% reliance on coal for energy they have their priorities. In the meanwhile the West sits idly by scratching it's arse as it drives into a pile of shit without any concerted plan to transition. So ni hao and I think we had all better learn how to kowtow, or should that be Kau tau.

What did he say that is not mere denial without any scientific backing?"
"Donald Duck","2018-06-23T19:27:06Z","That's correct. Private solar panel systems are more expensive than microgrids. Even if it took 10 years to break even - the system is good for 20 years guaranteed. That means you are saving about half of your electricity bill - which would, by the way, be much higher if fossil fuels were not so shamelessly subsidized with our tax money. The prices for solar panels are coming down due to upscaling.

>> Man-made climate change is a tax/power scam. 
Says the fossil fuel sponsored ""heartland institute"", which does no research at all - but is nothing but a propaganda machine. If you want to know if climate change is man made - just read what real climatologists write on their websites all over the world. The USA is the only country in the world where climate denial even exists. I go with the independent climatologists who work for their respective governments for a fixed income and whatever they come up with. Climate denial propaganda a la FOX infotainment is the real scam.

Just look at what the consequences were if we taxed fossil fuels instead of subsidizing them: Solar energy would get upscaled and become super cheap and available to everyone. With the fossil fuel monopoly broken, our cities would have electric cars instead, which means clean air and silence - and energy freedom instead of fossil fuel dependency. And no more wars for oil.

I am all for a law that forbids people to have children without having to pass a test to determine if they are psychologically fit and have the means to bring them up. After all, nobody opposes the tests to obtain a driving license. Children would soon become a status symbol for the rich - which will have many children to show off their wealth, which would take care of distributing the inheritance to many instead of a few. On the other hand, if criminals and people without a steady income don't have more than 1 child, criminality rates would go down and poverty would vanish within just two generations. Overpopulation would be a thing of the past - including the threat of man-made climate change.

But that, of course, is not in the interest of those who want an army of cheap, unskilled slaves. And it is not in the interest of religious organisations who literally thrive on the desperation of the deprived and mentally tortured."
"Donald Duck","2018-06-08T01:47:12Z",">>  From what I hear, an adequate solar panel system that can power an entire household, including several electric cars, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and would take decades to pay for itself. 

Fossil fuel funded propaganda. The price for a solar panel system on the roof big enough for a typical family household is $30,000, a tesla wall is $5,000 and an all electric car $32,000. It takes about 5 years for the solar panel system to pay for itself with a typical life span of 15 years.

Which means,  owners of solar panels save big on energy costs. The same goes for electric cars. Electricity costs about one third of gasoline to achieve the same mileage and the owners will never have to worry about oil changes, gear boxes, filters, mufflers, ... and batteries with an expected life span of about 15 years. - No wonder car dealers don't want to sell them. There is no business in service contracts in for them.

In short: The price tag on electric cars is about 20% more expensive than on gasoline cars - but over the life span of the electric car the owners save a lot of money - again. 

So what has this to do with global warming?
Fossil fuel companies openly admitted in court that global warming takes place. But at the same time they pay dubious organisations like the infamous ""heartland"" institute millions of dollars per year to seed doubt about climate change - for obvious reasons. They know that their time of rule is about to end.

I agree that banks must be even more powerful than big oil because of what you say is true. But I don't think they have a direct interest in supporting or fighting fossil fuels. I believe that's why some of them have already divested from fossil fuels, while others still support big oil - depending on their business policy I suppose.

Talking about re-distribution of wealth. According to a new study a growing number of the US population gets born so rich, that they get richer without ever having to work in their life. This phenomenon is called money aristocracy. These people are true kings and queens, lords and ladies with a host of servants and lawyers. They are so powerful that they can influence politics and change laws to their favour. The author of the book is worried about this development and sees it as a threat to democracy.

I am certainly no communist, but I am not a royalist either. I honestly don't know what to think about ""money aristocracy"" - the rule of the few super-rich over the rest. I am for democracy and freedom and against dictatorships of any kind. I think if the rich had more children and the poor less, then this would be no problem, but the reality shows that the rule is the other way around. What is your opinion on this?"

>> Any taxes on corporations are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
Making corporations pay for cleaning up their mess instead of leaving these costs to tax payers will result in higher prices for their dirty products. If you don't want to pay for cleaning up oil spills and other damage to the environment, then there is a very simply solution for your problem: Buy solar panels for your roof, a tesla wall for your home and an electric car.

I don't see why I should pay for all these tax brakes and subsidies for fossil fuel companies. They should cancel all subsidies for all kinds of energy sources. Let's see who hurts more - renewables or fossil fuel companies. (The latter get 6 times more support by the government) 

And I am not going to buy that stupid argument that government employed climatologists all over the world are in a conspiracy against big oil. I firmly believe that this climate denial fairy tale are all paid by Exxon and the Koch brothers. They feel that their monopoly is threatened by renewable energy. 

So they are swamping the internet with misinformation about climate change, solar energy and electric cars. The truth is: Big oil is so powerful that they influence politics so much in their favour that they practically own the government.

>> The Global Warming Scam is a massive redistribution of wealth scam cooked up by globalists to rape people of trillions of dollars. 
And how exactly is this supposed to work?
The world's governments force a transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy by putting laws into place that reduces the burning of fossil fuels. This is certainly bad for the owners of oil stocks - but that's probably not what you mean.

>> The earth has been cooling for over 18 years
By how many degrees Celsius and where do you have your information from?
I can provide you with the website addresses of 9 randomly chosen meteorolgical institutions. All of them say that global temperature has risen by about 0.9 degrees Celsius over the last 60 years. Why should they lie and how do they keep this scam, if it is indeed a scam, a secret from climatologists and idealistic students?

Your claim reminds me of one often repeated by creationists: That the dinosaur fossils in the museums were all fake. If that was true: How do they keep their secret save with all the hobby paleontologists and students?

>>   Taxing people trillions of dollars won't cool the planet one degree. 
A carbon tax would indeed make gasoline more expensive. That doesn't concern me much. We have an electric car. When everyone buys an electric car they get a lot cheaper. Alltogether it's already cheaper to have one. The maintenance is much cheaper and electricity anyway. A win-situation for all people on earth - except from the rich oil barons, of course.

Anyway - most of the world's governments have decided not to introduce this kind of tax and instead to simply put a lid on carbon emmissions via regulations. Big oil doesn't like that at all. But not everyone can be a winner in a changing economic climate.

>> The most bizarre thing about the global warming global police state scam is they say they plan to give trillions to undeveloped nations in Africa and other places. 
Who is ""they""? And can you show me an article with more information about this plan?

>> If you give trillions of dollars to a poor country in Africa the first thing they are going to do is buy millions of cars
Electric cars. India and China are planning to phase out gasoline cars by 2030 and 2040 respectively. I personally believe that the transition will be much faster. European countries have similar plans. The fossil fuel friendly U.S. government is not planning anything similar, for obvious reasons.

>> The Global Warming Scam is a hoax designed to control the earth's wealth, production and enslave the people of the earth in a one world communist police state.
Says who? 
Where did you get this information from?

And again: 
How does reducing CO2 emmissions help ""the communists"" to turn our democracies into police states?

To be honest:
I do not believe that it is possible to brainwash all climatologists in the world into faking their data.
I also do not believe that evil communists want to tax you personally for using a gasoline car in order to somehow overturn the world's democractic governments.

But I do believe that the fossil fuel industry is spreading misinformation about global warming and climate change in order to prevent climate action - which threatens their very existence. These companies have billions at their disposal to do that. They have basically already enslaved us in a certain way and want to keep it that way.

Solar panels on your rooftop, a tesla wall in the house and an electric car. That's what you need to be free from these people - and they are doing everything in their power, including taking over your government, to keep you having to go to the gasoline station. 

That's also why they keep telling you that electric cars were only for fags, that solar panels ruined the economy, that home batteries were bad for the environment and renewables were un-economic, un-american and a pou-pou in general."

The USA got hit by how many four Catagory 3 hurricanes hit the US coast line in 2017, (2018 will be interesting), the top 10 hottest years have all happened since 1998, and the ice shelves in the Antarctic aren't behaving as expected. 

And YES, sea level is rising. Current estimates put sea level rise at about 0.6m by 2100. And that'll be enough to make many low lying countries and island uninhabitable, and those people will have to go somewhere. (BTW: I believe a 0.3m sea level rise makes large sections of Florida uninhabitable, or at least not worth trying to save).

 As I'm aware; regardless of how much money he has; Dan Pena has ZERO scientific qualifications; so its a bit like trusting your accountant to preform your heart transplant.

Oh well, we'll just have to wait won't we. That is; YOUR kids and grandkids will get to wait and see because most of us won't be around when the chickens come home to roost. Lets hope we choose their future wisely.

BTW: Does anyone remember Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley? The LORD who wasn't a LORD. The man who lectured the world on ""the global warming hoax"" with his MA in classics, 1974; and his diploma in journalism studies? You must remember him? This guy: https://bbickmore.wordpress.com/lord-moncktons-rap-sheet/ Now I absolutely not implying anything wrong about Dan Pena, I'm just thinking that its best to take advise from those who have spent their lives working on the problem."

Miami University Scientists are recording alarming changes in sea level and lots not forget the 2016 floods. They are also saying there is effort from the governments of Miami and Florida to silence the talk because they don't want the scientists to stop the gravy train of beach front development. Sound familiar? Don't tell them it is bad for them because it may harm our profits..
Forget the scientists, lets go by what the profiteers have to say?
Banks make bad loans all the time, that is why we had a crisis in 2008. Derivatives, if structured properly, can encourage banks to make bad loans because they profit from the insurance against the loan.

Sometimes CO2 was up, and sometimes down, but the time it took to rise was very slow and the environment could handle the change.

Now let's say I take my entire year allotment of 52 punches to the face, and instead give them all to this idiot in one hour --as hard as I can. Well, his face will cave in and his head will fall off. It simply won't be able to cope with that level of impact and that speed of state change. The system, his body and life, would end.

Looking at it objectly, that lady was counter productive and shrill. Not a good representative of the scientifically literate. 

Those that choose to follow an old rich man that will die soon might consider that maybe the man is a sociopath and has absolutely no stake in the argument other than taking all of us down with him.

We all could to do some objective research, not on blogs or skeptic sites, but actual science sites with peer reviewed data and information. 

I've smarter people then me come to irrefutable conclusions and advise me. I am elderly and wealthy too, I have been reserved a place in a self sufficient shelter but nope. 

Rather than that I'll just take a ringside seat to the bitter end of life itself.

So generally:

Regardless, the bottom line is nothing will or can be done or changed at scale to fix or even mitigate the predicament.

I acknowledge that it is impossible to fix, therefore, the skeptics and deniers stance is the most practical. Reuse, recycle and reduce certainly, but nothing really can be done.

How do you all want to do or accomplish before the end? Keep in mind there is a ten year limit (at most)."

The liberal-left elites of the world (aka the communists) believe they have the right to take money you have worked hard for, and give it away to whom ever they please.  The working class people and the middle class people are nothing more than slavish worker bees in the hive the is the liberal-left ideological cosmos.  This is New World Order which the liberal-left intends to rule trough mass migration.  Mass migration insures they will always be voted in and never loose power.  People on the government dole always vote for their hand-out.  In the liberal-left utopia, the worker bees will always be just outnumbered and will live no better than those on the government hand-out.
The New World Order is global communism.  This is occurring all over the world.  Transfer of wealth and transfer of population.  This is why the liberal-left hates President Trump so very much.  Hillary Clinton and the liberal elites in the Democrat Party were going to do the same thing here that Angela Merkel and the liberal elites are doing in Europe.
The reeducation camps (public schools) have been thriving for many generations now.  The typical student now favors socialism and communism over capitalism and a democratic republic.  The liberals have done a great job at dumbing down students for generations and have produced an anti-western culture and anti-white populace.  I'm a retired teacher and I have seen it for over 35 years.  If you work in the reeducation brainwashing centers, you don't dare say anything.

Basically you can track these temperatures to the milankovitch cycles. It's fairly predictable in patterning which is why you see this uptick. The difference being is what generally happens in the past is a slight warming event, causing co2 efflux leading to more warming until a new steady state. The issue is.... We have added anthropogenic co2 that wasn't in that cycle. It's like basically adding a ladder to a diving board. Your heights higher so the splash potential is bigger. Part of being an intelligent person is knowing when to defer to your own ignorance on a subject and that if your personal opinion is in direct opposition to the leaders of a field? Well your argument might want to be strong for holding such opinion. I. E. If you're a flat eather you better have a good fucking argument. Issue is... Conspiracy nuts never realize their own ignorance. But whatever. Keep listening to people who don't actually know what they're talking about.

The story of Noah is found in many religions, some of them older than the bible claims the world to have existed for.

As for Sodom & Gomorrah, the original Hebrew text says the men who came to Lots house wanted ""yada""  which is ""to know"" them. Not to have sex with them. Which makes perfect sense given these were strangers in their community. Yada is used over 900 times in the original texts with various meanings. 

Not that it matter much as the entire point of Jesus was to say the old ways are not the correct ways.

Your interpretation comes from the good king James, which has been badly translated and as I noted above, is missing a lot of content. A life time as a catholic of which I have would teach you the bible is not the beginning nor the end or the Christian faith. Nor is it to be interpreted literally."

We have altered the amplitude.  The northern and southern hemispheres are no longer equal, energy transference from northern to southern jet stream across the equator has also increased, and all of it has increased the turbulence in the system, so now not only are we getting stronger weather events but contrary to what models suggested, we are getting more of them.

For those that wish to truly understand and not just spout their opinion, here are some links that may help address two of Mr. Pena's comments (please note these are not peer reviewed papers by proper journals, but a nice layman way of explaining things).

1. As to the one piece of science Mr. Pena did mention, I understand from this video, Mr. Pena asked the scientist that took core samples if climate change has happened in the past? That was the wrong question, of course it has, but what is it that is different in these last 150 years? Feel free on an easy read of why now is different that the last 450,000 years of ice core samples: http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2007/06/29/human_cause-3/ is one of many explanations of why it saying climate change has always happened is not a good argument. 

2. As to why Mr. Pena refers to financial lending as proof of climate change or global warming in not happening is beyond me.  I do question, is these the same lending institutions that had to use almost 3/4's of a trillion taxpayer dollars to bail them out on bad loans, because they are only concern about quick profits as per this Wikipedia page explains: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008? And banks don't care the onus is on the developers and they usually leave the middle class condo buyers stuck with the bill after (as per a quick search that came up with this article): http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-condo-owners-still-paying-for-big-repair-bills-1.1264358. Although Canada, I'm sure many examples can be found anywhere.  

I have not followed Mr. Pena and how he made his money, but I usually find that it is on the middle class citizen either, through extensive prices, collusion and price fixing, government subsidies, fixing the books, or bailouts where they get paid millions of dollars in bonuses: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/business/31pay.html."

Like the tobacco industry before, the fossil fuel industry has spent tens of millions of dollars in spreading the following lies about climate change:

1.) That scientists were divided about the science behind it.
The truth is: Practically all climatologists agree that climate change is a fact and it is man-made. Climate change means stronger hurricanes, more floodings, sea level rise, draughts and forest fires and yes, winters with extreme cold. So far the predictions made by climate models from 20 years ago have been accurate.

2.) That there was a world wide conspiracy to somehow bring down america by ""depriving"" it from energy independence.
To me it is the fossil fuel industry who is conspiring to spread misinformation about climate change, electric cars and renewable energy sources. If the U.S. invested more money into renewable energy it could truly achieve energy independence.

3.) Renewable energy is too expensive and unreliable
The truth is: Unsubsidized renewable energy including storage is already cheaper than coal and at price parity with gas. 
On the other hand the U.S. government, now controlled by fossil fuel interests, is subsidizing coal, oil and gas with billions of tax payer money every year and this sum is not including the damages to the public caused by the use of dirty energy. Additionally the military effort made by the U.S. in the Middle East to ensure access to oil and the wars fought there for oil has cost tax payers unimaginable amounts of money.

4.) Even if the climate changed, it had hardly any effect - CO2 is good for plants
CO2 may be good for plants in general but extreme wheather is not. If whole nations dry up, people there will need to move on - into other countries, like the U.S. e.g.? Mass migration usually is not good for the world economy.

But please, keep driving your petrol sucking SUV's as long as you can and leave progress to the rest of the world. It might not be such a bad thing if the U.S. left world leadership to others for a change and maybe there are better ways of living than the american dream of corporate dictatorship, religious bigotry and consumerism."

"Ben Hansen","2018-02-09T17:10:17Z","What I asked was what specific elements does co2 bond with so that it can be carried aloft. I am working on a greenhouse business plan and what I have found seems to contradict. Think of oil and water. it can be mixed up. but it does not take long to settle out. On the ground co2 is between 300-700 parts per million, and that diminishes with elevation. What are the parts per million at say 10 000 feet. Plus its part of the life cycle. humans on the average exhale about 2 lbs per day, I don't know the numbers for the animal kingdom . however there are many animals so the amounts would be up there. Plants take in co2 in the daytime as part of photosynthesis. At night its the opposite. they consume oxygen. As for absorption the plants use more co2 as temp rises  and depending on the plant some will thrive in 3000 ppm. 
           So to summarize. weight differences are a fact, Co2 does not bond with water that's a fact. So what does it bond with. Do you know what the ppm is at high altitude. These facts I would like to know, if you don't that's fine , I appreciate you trying to answer my questions. I am not saying anyone is right or wrong, I just want hard facts and not someones koas calculations ( nonlinear dynamics). I will draw my own conclusions."
"ArmyOfAll","2018-02-09T07:53:27Z","Think of it like when you pass flower onto a grate, as you shuffle the larger pieces end up on the surface, so you have that effect driven by convection (which provides plenty of lift) and Coriolis (rotation of the earth) providing further turbulence.

Obviously no process is 100% efficient and some of it does indeed drop to the ground but sadly most of it doesn't. Of human emissions, 39 billion tons a year reaches the atmosphere, the equivalent of 292,000 volcanoes worth every year (for context there are only 1500 active volcanoes on earth) with varying rates of integration (time taken from emission to effect) on average it takes 37 years for an emission of Co2 from us to settle in and be a fully active greenhouse gas. 

Meaning most of the effects we have experienced so far only take us up to the emissions of the early 1980's, post that time our Co2 emissions exploded with the ascent of global capitalism. Buckle up, as the world we are now in, has not existed for at least 3 million years. The effects of that are already being seen."
"Ben Hansen","2018-02-09T07:15:27Z","That's interesting. I don't know the term but co2 does not mix well, eg club soda, as soon as the pressure is released the co2 departs the water very quickly. According to the engineers toolbox the weight and density are both quite a bit more than air and did not change very much with temp. I know in a calm environment it sinks around a foot per second in air. The greenhouse operators use lots of air flow and its still about 2 to 3 ft off the floor. So what does it mix that has enough difference to elevate it, I was told it did not stratify."
"ArmyOfAll","2018-02-09T01:09:47Z","Atmospheric mixing raises Co2 and other gasses up and keeps them there. It takes roughly 37 years from emission to effect for most of human produced Co2. With fluid dynamics, density is a factor, but it doesn't dictate the position of a particle during its most active state. For Co2 not to rise the earth would have to be at the same temperature everywhere on earth and not rotating at all, as opposed to us currently rotating at 1000mph while hurtling around the sun at 67,000 mph."

Pena is right to say that if banks knew that global warming was a real risk, there would be a disclaimer of sorts. But it could be that there are 10's of 100's of years until it would have an effect so there for the disclaimers could be a delayed effect. If it ends up that global warming is indeed a real risk, it would be indeed to late. The most reasonable ways to mitigate the effect would be technology to combat the rise, and to seek other habitat for humanity on other planets. In all reality, who knows? Leave it to the pro's."

Even those who inherit such large sums, like Trump, while they may not be criminal their family most certainly was at some point to amass that amount, usually by ripping off poor people who can't fight back or are trapped in some economic or other situation...like Trumps dad in public housing and Trump himself taking advantage of gambling addicts.  The working poor in American actually pay a significant amount of tax to oil billionaires like Rex Tillerson...obscene beyond ludicrous.

A military dictatorship that has a rigid hierarchy, with one ""divine"" leader at the top. That's about as right wing as you can get. Yes, some of the original ideas were from Marxism and Socialism, but it is through right wing adherence to hierarchy and maintaining the status quo, that the DPRK remains not very Democratic at all.

You do know that socialism is an extreme left ideology, and that most people on the left want a mixture of socialism and capitalism, right? You do know that you don't have to go very far right to get to authoritarianism, right?

Oh, and PS, many of those 100 million deaths were due to Russia's anti-West stance, and that included being anti-evolution. They predicated their agricultural practices on the work of Lysenko, and that lead to millions of deaths by starvation (1-1.5 million in 1946-47 alone). They made the mistake of letting their ideology influence their science, just as the right is with climate change, right now. 

https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/disastrous-effects-lysenkoism-soviet-agriculture 

A great many pro-capitalism folks, especially in America, are also anti-evolution (and anti-climate change)... and many of them are rural folk, who make their livings, either directly or indirectly, from farming. Let that sink in. Notice that most arguments against climate change are against cap and trade or the negative impacts to capitalism, and not about the science at all.

I personally hold no truck with cap and trade, and I am convinced that climate change is occurring, that we're at fault, and that our continual failure to act will have devastating consequences in the next 80-100 years. It is that timeframe which is exactly why most politicians don't care - they won't be alive when the shit hits the fan.

Would you care to estimate how many people have been killed by capitalism? Mostly not in the countries that are capitalist themselves (although there have been millions of unnecessary deaths in the US due to for-profit medicine), but what about the countries from which the capitalist nations extract the wealth (and low cost labour), and allow the deaths of many millions due to starvation or disease? Africa. The Middle East. South East Asia. South America. The difference is not the size of the body count, but how hard it is to track all of the deaths because they were less direct (ad that was intentional, because you can be damned sure that the major international knew damned well what the negative effects of their business would be on the local economy)."

"George Piper","2018-01-23T18:07:08Z","Thanks for your response. His argument about the banks was interesting, however, I think it's worth remembering that it would not be the first time banks have miscalculated on the risks of their investments in a loosely regulated financial market. The most recent example of a severe miscalculation can be seen in the GFC which was brought about by the banks lending to individuals who could not afford to pay back their multi-million dollar loans. If the banks failed to see the risk in lending to virtual teenagers without jobs, I wouldn't be surprised if they fail to see the risks of global warming which are a bit more complicated. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a global warming ""Crusader"" and do not necessarily believe that half the world is going to sink in the next half-century, however, I do believe that we are risking a lot by going down this current path.  when there could be better alternatives.

Yea, the coast lines have been changing since the formation of land masses, that's the reason I'm glad that we didn't get locked into the climate deal, here's what would wind up happening, every time some beach front property in a country other than ours erodes we would absorb the cost of repair  (as if coast lines would not change without man), America would have to pay to fix it based on the logic that since America has benefitted the most from the industrial revolution and has dumped more carbon into the air since the beginning of the industrial revolution it's our fault someone's beach front property is in danger, does that include all the carbon we dumped into the air because we ramped up our industry to save the free world? My parents told me when they were kids during the war (WW2) on a night with low cloud cover you could drive an automobile all around the country side without the headlights on because it was lit up from all the coke ovens (they're used in the steel making process) running 24/7 for the war effort, I'll bet the French weren't crying about emissions then, and the ""bundled carbon credit"" system that was invented for that deal was designed LITERALLY by the same exact bankers who came up with the ""bundle mortgage risk"" system that crashed our economy in 20008. Some years back I watched a Discovery Channel special on the ice ages in the history of the earth, they showed a western hemisphere map with a horizontal time line moving from left to right at the bottom of the screen that started hundreds of thousands of years ago, as the time line moved the poles froze toward each other almost all the way to the equator and then retreated back to almost non existence to only turn around and do it again 5 or 6 times during the time line  (I'll bet no one would show that imagery on a show that's pitching global warming), as far as coastal lines and property goes it's been changing since the formation of the continents, all beach front property is going to shift and change with or without mankind, when structures such as homes and hotels are threatened by this engineers will come up with solutions, as I said they're very smart people, I mean after all they got us to the moon and back, harnessed nuclear energy, built civilian airliners that can fly faster than sound, and I can tell you from personal experience that they are designing engines in this day and age that are mind boggling efficient compared to the ones made just 25 to 30 years ago, they'll eventually figure out ways of weening us off of carbon based fuels and all the other stuff that's bad for the environment, had they done it properly 40 years ago instead of just yanking the rug out from industries the last people hired in those industries would be retiring now without the economic turmoil I have witnessed, but instead in the name of environmental correctness and grandchildren they charge headfirst into something that the resulting poverty has destroyed a once proud people and turned them into a society of people who stare at the mailbox waiting for their check so they can go buy a pill, these are people who were the grandchildren in the late 70's, now they're beat down drug addicted hollow eyed beings that it breaks my heart to go back there and see."
"David Hyrman","2018-03-29T06:12:17Z","Duke Craig alright man that was perfectly said. I think we've come to a point of agreement and I certainly hadn't brought us any closer to this point, I apologize for being a little immature. Your personal experience that you've shared totally gave me a new perspective and what you said about the 30 50 whatever year extinction event is also spot on. I'm worried about coastal cities being flooded (some degree of sea level rise is absolutely scientifically plausible of not probable, the ice caps are melting) because I and many large cities  live on the coast. It would only take a few feet to ruin most those cities. As opposed to bringing the time that that happens closer I feel it would be helpful to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Not because of fear of a global cataclysm but in the spirit of the very improvements you talked about mechanics and engineers making to discover new energy sources and solve whatever problems we may have caused. I guess what I'm saying is that I think a lot of people with myself included are not trying to transition out of fossil fuels to prove global warming is largely being caused by us out of fear tactics but actually with progress in mind. Why should we not progress onto a cleaner, cheaper source of energy? The jobs that would be lost in coal would be gained in technological development. The times change man and we gotta change with them. I don't think global warming will end man but there will be reprecussions that can be avoided simply by following the very problem that started it, the progress of technology. Once again I'd like to thank you for being mature and sharing your experience. You seem like a cool guy."

Dude look at all the drop downs from this video, it's full of videos of scientists and people like the founder of The Weather Channel who talk about how their findings will not even be looked at by these ""expert panels"" that Gore and his ilk love to quote, a lot of these people don't work for any corporations or anybody because they are retired, I've seen scare tactics used to get people to do and think things all my life, I worked as a mechanic for years and saw many mechanics in places that pay by percentage tell old women things like ""If I had grandchildren I wouldn't feel safe taking them in a car with brakes in this condition"" when in fact they were perfectly serviceable brakes that only needed adjusted, I always chose to operate in an honest manner, scare tactics are what got the ""Freedom Act"" passed in this country and as a result we now have mysterious courts that don't seem to have to answer to the public, scare tactics were used to convince everyone that there were was ""Weapons of mass destruction"" in Iraq, dude what I'm trying to get across to you is that this ""extinction level event"" in 20, 30, 50, or even 100 or 200 years is total bullshit scare tactics to try to steer the public down certain paths in life, I'm sure mankind has an affect on the climate but it's not anywhere near the level that these people use to get the public to think the way they want them to, the world and mankind are both going to be here in a thousand years, any problems we encounter on the way will be overcome, have some faith, engineers are smart people and will figure out how  to deal any problems that come along in the future, what we don't need are more manufacturing jobs wiped out by extremists who are convinced that if we burn coal for one more year the world is doomed, I'm from an area that when I was a kid in the early 70's everybody had jobs in the mines and mills, dad's provided for their families, those U.S. Steel paychecks bought a lot of homes, cars, college tuition for their kids and provided health care and a secure future for people, by the late 70's the jobs were gone but people still had their ethics and ""salt of the earth"" reputation, but after 40 years of numbing poverty I can take you back to that area and all you will see is poverty, single motherhood, opiate addiction, and the most corrupt courts you've ever seen, that's what happens when you yank the economic rug out from underneath a community, when I was a kid and my parents would take me and my sister to Pittsburgh, about 50 miles away, you could smell that city before you could see it, now because of the scrubbers and other devices put on steel mills you can stand right next to the Edgar Thompson Works and you can't even smell it, but people see smoke coming out of those stacks they want it shut down in the name of their grandchildren, I can show you grandchildren brought up in the ruins of American industry and it's not pretty, right now most of the steel we buy in the form of products is made in China and it's far ""dirtier"" and worse for the environment than if it was made in America. Future generations are something that need to be taken into consideration but I can show you how their lives will be without the current generation having jobs to be able to provide for their future, poverty and public welfare is a numbing dead end cycle that I have seen up close and personal and I can assure you it does nothing for future generations."

As for Gore you brought him up. I do not idolize him. At the same time I'd like to see you live with as much influence and money as he has and not live in a nice house. He's earned it, but I don't agree with everything he says. You keep saying it's impossible to see the climate change in a life time, I've responded that we can see the trend from ice cores that give us millions of years of data. Additionally if you can't perceive climate change in a single life time you can't observe it at all because single lifetimes span across thousands of years. What I mean is we have information from more than one generation. My final question is do you deny that greenhouse gasses have any effect on trapping heat in the atmosphere?

So much for worrying about the environment. What's your indisputable scientific evidence, you dad grew up in Slovakia and used to dry his clothes on a line? Once again anyone who thinks that they have observed a change in the earth's climate in their lifetime is not stopping to consider the age of this planet and how many times it's frozen from both poles to almost meet at the equator and then recede back to two tiny white patches at the poles, the planet has been going through these cycles for millions of years, if you paid attention to my earlier post you'll recall I mentioned a scientist I know personally and a conversation I had with her 28 years ago, and for the past 28 years every time I've seen someone on TV barking all the usual doomsday climate predictions I chuckle thinking about what she told me about how the funding game works with those people, even the guy who founded The Weather Channel has said that it's a corporate agenda being pushed on people with scare tactics, and what's with people like you who think you're the only people virtuous enough to care about grandchildren?

that you have been lied to is bad enough, but then for you to repeat the lies because you do not want to educate yourself.    
in the past, before the effort of the fascists to silence the discussions, science was a purely academic adventure, you tested and when it worked each time, you did not draw conclusions, you just stated it worked every time.   
now you are faced with a decision.  continue to listen to those who lied to you, or go out and do some research on your own.   do not only listen to one side, listen to both, and when something 'seems' to not fit, go to the experts, not the politicians or anyone that says consensus.
I would venture to say you have no idea where the 97%  figure came from.
Mann, read over 800 full technical papers PER HOUR, that is not a title, note a sentence or a paragraph, but a complete scientific technical paper,  after reading thousand upon thousands of papers, at times, 800 full documents per hour (not all the time)  he tallied the perspective of the writer and he determined that the paper was writing so as to have the writers views to be either for man caused global warming, or not. 
so that 97% was a result of one person, who had the ability to read 800 full technical scientific papers in an hour.    
from that, the 97% number has been repeated by those who KNOW that fact, but choose to not REVEAL that fact.

If the ocean was expected to rise 10 feet in 40 years, that is like 3 inches a year.  

We aren't seeing anything like that right now.  Its easy empirical evidence to prove.  According to EPA studies, the average sea level is rising at a constant rate of about 3.2 mm per year.  This rate has remained steady since 1890 until just the last few years.  

So.. claims by purveyors of panic?  3 inches per year
Actual data?  0.126 inches per year (3.2 mm = 0.126 inches )

Empirical data says those claiming severe rises in sea level are, well, all wet.

Further.. in the last 3 years the rate has completely flattened.. that is the most curious datum of all.  My question?  What does the earth know that we don't?

What we are doing in this age is certainly having a negative affect on environments around the world, that is a proven fact and if you don't believe that, you're a moron. 

The Global Warming scam is trying to wake people up and say ""Hey! We're not immortal and neither is our Planet. We need to think of some clean energy and waste management before we fuck up to the point we can't come back from."" 

I don't think that time is anywhere in our lifetime, but we're seeing the first evidence of it. Kind of like smoking a cigarette in a closed car. It's not really doing anything major, but you know you should probably open a window.
 
If it's scamming money from me, I surely didn't notice. 
Taxation? 
If the government wants to buy hookers and dildos on a planetary scale with tax dollars, I really don't give a fuck because it doesn't negatively impact me any more than their current spending habits. 
With tax dollars spent on Global Warming, at least someone is getting enjoyment out of being a scientist on the front of Global Warming research, and hey, maybe they do prove without a doubt that Global Warming is an imminent threat. Or maybe they don't and they learn something else. That's the beauty of science, they're always learning something even when they fail. 

I don't know for sure what Global Warming is, whether it's a ""scam"" (I get a chuckle when people call it that), or if it is actually real. I'm not a fuckin' scientist and neither are most of you.

"Ilyan Oneill","2018-01-18T00:07:12Z","The problem is who ever called this issue global warming. It should be called extreme climate amplification as in stronger storms, colder winters and longer droughts. And yes this is part of the natural history of our planet. However this has usually taken thousands of years to shift. So with the add of  7.5 billion people adding to the fold the change is happening must faster then ever previously recorded. Yes we are the cause of this and as an advanced species we need to be the ones to fix it. We have over come plague, war and countless tragedies. This is just common sense, if a fuel source is not renewable it must there for be finite. This means if humanity is to be sustainable we must have sustainable and or renewable energy. This is not even debatable by anyone with a brain.
Now the funny part is even though I enjoy a old fat rich guy ranting off. Here is the part he did not disclose. So he said the banks wouldn‚Äôt invest if there where to great of risks?!! Are you kidding me? The banks have a I can do what ever I want card and get bailed out. They have no accountability!! Lol 
To ask the people who do you trust the banks or science is the funniest f$&king question of all time. The only people who trust banks are bankers! This guy should have been wearing a top hat and had a gold cane. He looks out on the crowd and sees sheep that don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best for themselves. 
So here is food for thought:
If climate change is a HOAX then here are the consequences.

We give ourselves the best change for ending needless war for oil, eliminate petroleum pollution of our air and water.

So, whether climate change is real, man-made or naturally occurring ""Leave it better than you found it"" seems to be a pragmatic, responsible approach. However, I get, being an outdoor enthusiast, that based on the amount of tossed cigarette butts and other random discarded trash my fellow human pigs leave scattered about, that this notion of ""Leave it better than you found it"" is hopelessly naive.

"Doubledunk","2018-03-09T16:28:36Z","Damian Thorn I agree with everything you said. I just dont like this guy cos he's so obviously and fervently appealing to the 'anti-climate change' crowd. I think both sides are stupid. You don't even need to concern yourself with this issue if you just live considerately about what you consume, your waste & the environment. Everyone should somewhat strive and take pride into having as little an 'footprint' as possible. Unfortunately these values aren't a norm in some places in the world due to social/cultural and economic reasons. Some people are just stupidly wasteful. 

Anyway besides that, in some places such as Sydney with fucked up increasingly high power bills you'd be stupid not to have solar on your property in the near future or even now. There isn't much more you can do than that, so why concern yourself with climate change?"
"Damian Thorn","2018-02-25T06:57:02Z","Doubledunk¬† In all fairness both sides of this discussion have a lot of people who are not exactly scientific mouthing off though its usually the¬†pro¬†man made climate crowd that I see the most doing this usually because they don't¬†talk science instead their whole argument is a.... '97% consensus'¬† which¬†may be convincing to many¬†BUT IT IS NOT PROOF! I actually thought¬†the guy in this video made¬†quite a valid point....it is strange that banks and financial services aren't preparing for an apparently bleak future and instead its business as usual in terms of long term loans. I think there is at least a chance that they believe the situation is being completely exaggerated."
"Jwalker1850","2018-04-10T01:08:08Z","HandyMan101 YES THEY WOULD. There's still plenty of time to pay off a loan and profit at the same time, and if banks feel they can get the dough before then then yeah people would still get loans. People don't get loans unless the bank thinks they're going to get it back and more. Trust me I hope I'm wrong about global warming and that it never happens, but i seriously doubt that. Following peoples spending habits isn't proof that global warming isn't real."
"Jwalker1850","2018-04-10T00:14:36Z","HandyMan101  I'm not bright enough to have this discussion yet you're still talking to me? Says a lot about you. Also, you're fixated on the same argument which is (dumbed down) ""rich people invest in beachfront and don't believe in climate change so neither do I."" I've already explained why that argument is retarded. And yeah I'm sure most of them put as much research as this guy did in the video (which is close to nothing). I think the problem is your thinking if people risk that much on property and make huge profits there's no such thing as global warming. You can make money off those properties long before sea levels rise. As for the rest 1) Al Gore is dumb in my opinion and he doesn't speak for everyone 2) Magazines have done crazier stories and all that proves is that they were wrong about the ice age (doesn't mean Anything about global warming) 3) You do realize the people who are trying to convince you that global warming is a myth have their own agenda too right? Like the Fossil Fuel Industry. Anywho, you're going to believe what you believe and I'm not going to change my mind either. Lets just agree to disagree and that Al Gore is dumb."
"Jwalker1850","2018-04-09T22:46:39Z","HandyMan101 uh  . . . yeah, Maybe. One reason could be because they plan to collect the money long before it happens or don't believe in global warming. Again, brokers and elites aren't scientists: Their experts at making money not in forecasting something they don't understand. I'd say find some common sense but as the saying goes that's not so common anymore. So how about  think outside the box? But if it makes you feel better, I don't care. Believe what you want. All I'll say is if you want advise for making money then yeah ask the old prune for help if you think he knows what his doing, but you don't have to worship the rest of his ideology. Honestly, I wouldn't care about his health advise from the way he looks-- same goes for his dumb assessment of global warming."

Take it from a statistician, one who knows how to look at evidence much more effectively than most scientists. Even if the claim was doomsday true, the huge political movement to fund climate change research and government programs to stop it, both useless to anyone that knows anything about economics, exhibits the fraud.

One because (again) climate science isn't the field of expertise banks operate in, you wouldn't trust a mechanic to prescribe you heart medicine, why a banker with rises in carbon emissions. And two banks have been shown in the past to operate on a present model that makes them money today even if in the long term it could hurts them (2008 housing market bubble is just one example).

"A.","2018-01-16T19:29:29Z","Global warming is definitely a thing, the increase of global warming is the actual problem being discussed.
Global warming is making sure the earth has a habitable temperature to sustain life.
The *increase* in temperature has already be proven many times so you can't deny that, there is too much evidence, there is even indirect evidence like bigger tornadoes and extreme changes in weather through seasons.
Now what can an increase of 1 or 2 degrees Celsius do you ask? Quite a lot, but nothing serious though.
But what we do now only has effect in 40 years from now, so what will happen then?
Well, the temperature will increase by a few more degrees Celsius.
But what will *that* increase do?
A lot, even *worse* tornadoes, floods and it might stop the huge underwater current of which I forgot the name that's keeping the sea heated, once that current stops a new ice age will be triggered.
In other words, big trouble.

"Douglas Needham","2018-01-16T19:01:27Z","It never ceases to amaze me how many people fall for this.  Would you go to a plumber for brain cancer or some rare, fatal disease?  Or would you go to a medical specialist who knows what the latest peer reviewed research in the field is? Even better would be would you trust a banker to disarm a bomb set to blow up the building you and every member of your family are stuck inside, or would you rather have someone who works in the field? And while some of you might point towards folks like Dr. Ivar Giaever or Dr. Freeman Dyson and their disbelief, this is like trusting a proctologist to tell you you do not have brain cancer.  Dr. Giaever specializes in solid state physics, such as is used in designing semiconductors, and later in biophysics, while Dr. Dyson is quantum electrodynamics, solid state physics, and nuclear physics, as well as having talked about some concepts in civilizations colonizing space, such as Dyson Spheres. As such, they are in effect the proctologist who decides wrongly to speak outside of their field, going up against hundreds of neuro-oncologists who have discussed your case and confirmed that you do have a rare form of brain cancer. 

In addition, you have to look for financial motives of a number of deniers.  Both Pena and Dr. Giaever benefit in the short to medium term from businesses not having to deal with regulations to start curbing AGW.  There have been a number of instances where scientists have been paid by groups and published findings which were found to be false if not outright fraudulent. You (I hope) would not trust a snake oil salesman for your cancer treatment as well...

Regarding the temperatures at SPS (or the recent temps in the eastern US), if you look at what has been published, you will see items such as the following:

1) Notes that the extreme southern polar regions will behave slightly differently than one might casually expect, because of zonal barriers similar to those seen around the tropical regions, and that the northern polar region would be far more susceptible due to the proximity of large land masses which are not permanently covered in snow/ice.
2) That there would be some areas which at various times would be cooler or wetter while others would be warmer/drier, and that it was important to look at the overall trends.

Both of these were being talked about back in the early 1980s in papers and lectures, such as those written/given by Dr. Lonnie Thompson and his wife, Ellen Mosley-Thompson at the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State."
"Marcus Alexander","2018-01-16T18:58:20Z","""The 13.8 billion years weve been on this planet"". Ummm the earth is 4.3 billion years old buddy, and life started around 1-2 billion years ago. The universe is close to 14 billion years old. What this guy needs to understand is reality doesn't care about what Bankers think about the future. Scientists don't say ""hey, what do the bankers think is going to happen?"" Bankers are not scientists in the field of atmospherics. Another thing that human-caused global warming deniers don't take into account is we are conducting vast deforestation on this planet. Vegetation takes in Mass amounts of CO2, acting as a buffer system for the planet. In the past, our planet had vast Global forests to keep rising greenhouse gases in check. Being that we are wiping out our forests, this excess CO2 is not only being trapped in our atmosphere, making more and more radiant energy remain after bouncing off the surface, but it is also being dissolved in our oceans, making our oceans pH drop, similar to what happens in humans with respiratory acidosis, making the oceans more acidic, killing our life in the oceans. Anyone who's ever had a fish tank knows if you mess up the pH, fish die. The Plankton will die, the coral reefs will die. There goes the food chain. All life on this planet, including us, depend on healthy oceans. All you have to do to find out what happens to a planet where global warming goes out of control is to look at Venus. Geologists have confirmed that Venus use to have vast oceans, and was very similar to earth, similar temps and atmospheric pressure, but because of a run away greenhouse effect, is now the hottest planet in the solar system, even hotter than the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury, with temperatures high enough to melt lead, at over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus may not have had Global forests to keep greenhouse gases in check, nor the bacteria, and it is also closer to the Sun, making it exposed to higher levels of radiant energy, energy that was continously trapped in its atmosphere. Nasa has confirmed human beings are causing global warming. Go to nasa.gov for yourself and read about it. NASA put men on the moon, and puts SUV sized Rovers on Mars. They build massive rockets that allow us to explore the universe. They have a massive earth science budget they use to understand our planet, including  weather,  but people don't want to believe them when they tell our society that we're fucking up. We better treat this speck of dust right, because for now, its the only home we have."

Covert Insidious Global Domination enabled through control of currency and credit by a small set of private individuals (e.g., Jekyll Island, etc.) and use of bread and circus distractions (like global warming hysteria) . . . THAT is the BIGGEST FRAUD in all of history.

Global Warming has been shown for what it is through ClimateGate and ClimateGate 2.0 with the release of emails like these from the suppose ""consensus"" pushers ---

""internal debates among scientists hoping to determine whether man's actions are warming the planet.""

 Hoping to determine? When it was already widely stated as FACT?

More tidbits (among much much more) --

""I agree with Nick that climate change might be a better labelling than global warming""

and

""Observations do not show rising temperatures throughout the tropical troposphere unless you accept one single study and approach and discount a wealth of others. This is just downright dangerous. We need to communicate the uncertainty and be honest. ""

 and

 ""I also think the science is being manipulated to put a political spin on it, which for all our sakes might not be too clever in the long run.""

and

""""Today‚Äôs decisions should be based on all the information we can get, not on hiding the decline""

and

"" Need to convince readers that there really has been an increase in knowledge ‚Äì more evidence. What is it?""

 and

""It seems that a few people have a very strong say, and no matter how much talking goes on beforehand, the big decisions are made at the eleventh hour by a select core group.""

 and

 ""I find myself in the strange position of being very skeptical of the quality of all present reconstructions, yet sounding like a pro greenhouse zealot here!""

and

 ""I too don‚Äôt see why the schemes should be symmetrical. The temperature ones certainly will not as we‚Äôre choosing the periods to show warming.""

 and

 ""We don‚Äôt really want the bullshit and optimistic stuff that Michael has written [‚Ä¶] We‚Äôll have to cut out some of his stuff.""

 and

 ""the important thing is to make sure they‚Äôre loosing the PR battle. That‚Äôs what the site [Real Climate] is about.""

and

""Having established scale and urgency, the political challenge is then to turn this from an argument about the cost of cutting emissions ‚Äì bad politics ‚Äì to one about the value of a stable climate ‚Äì much better politics. [‚Ä¶] the most valuable thing to do is to tell the story about abrupt change as vividly as possible""

and

""Somehow we have to leave the[m] thinking OK, climate change is extremely complicated, BUT I accept the dominant view that people are affecting it, and that impacts produces risk that needs careful and urgent attention.""

"roy A.W.J.","2018-02-18T14:43:58Z","mark kerlin; I am going to babble a bit, kind of thinking typing out loud. I have read and watched material on, what I am going to call, cycles of the sun. This also has its critics, or at least some difference of opinion. Yes there are those that believe we are in or moving into a cooling period due to the sun, and I remember being fascinated with stories of the last mini ice age when the thames river froze over, and reading about possible causes for the next ice age. Things to do with, possibly, ocean currents or possibly the sun. On the other side, some are saying we are curtailing a cooling period because of global warming.

My thoughts are this; Mankind is the fly in the ointment, for better and worse I can't imagine doing what we have done to our planet and not having an effect on the enviroment. And I try to approach situations with different perspectives. The United States seems to be falling behind on so many levels.
The world is moving towards renewable energy, the technology is improving, and getting cheaper, but we are still trying to stroke everyones ego. one arguement says my tax dollar shouldn't have to pay for it, and I have to ask why stop now. government money went into both oil and nuclear in there beginnings and we wouldn't have half the technology we do today without the space program, and lets not forget about the railroad and the boon that became. The list goes on. As far as jobs go, I don't want to loose my job, but technology both creates and costs jobs. The paper industry has lost a couple hundred thousand related jobs, due to technology.
Another arguement, why not keep adding renewable energy to cut back on the pollution? The world popullation is growing and so is the energy demand, and in the United States doing things that we already know works, things that other countries have proven work, becomes a fight with both enviromentalists and big business.
And sinse I'm on a rant, our sand deserts around the world are growing, due to, inpart to, deforestation and over farming. Both china and africa are doing things to combat this  and seem to be making a difference. In my opinion africa is having better luck because they are using different methods and I have seen a few youtube videoes on reclaiming african deserts. At least one method costs next to nothing. My point being if we can reclaim some of our US dessert at a relatively low cost, wouldn't that help our environment, but again enviromentalists and big business or we are just turning a blind eye to it.
There are a lot of feasible inexpencive ideas out there, wether you believe in man made climate change or not, that could possibly change things for the better and I could hunt and talk about them all day, but the people with the power (left and right) don't seem to want to sit down and talk about it because they are stuck in there own ideas.

""There are well-understood physical mechanisms by which changes in the amounts of greenhouse gases cause climate changes. The US National Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society produced a booklet, Climate Change: Evidence and Causes...The booklet discusses the evidence that the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and are still increasing rapidly, that climate change is occurring, and that most of the recent change is almost certainly due to emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activities.
Further climate change is inevitable; if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated, future changes will substantially exceed those that have occurred so far. "" Direct quote from the National Academy of Sciences.

What is perhaps more worrying, is that the US government has recently abandoned reason altogether and is now promoting ""alternative facts"" instead of science. It is best not to follow this example.

In his novel State of Fear, Michael Crichton asserted that the Antarctic data contradict global warming.[4] The few scientists who have commented on the supposed controversy state that there is no contradiction,[5] while the author of the paper whose work inspired Crichton's remarks has said that Crichton ""misused"" his results.[6] There is no similar controversy within the scientific community,[7] as the small observed changes in Antarctica are consistent with the small changes predicted by climate models, and because the overall trend since comprehensive observations began is now known to be one of warming. At the South Pole, where some of the strongest cooling trends were observed between the 1950s and 1990s, the mean trend is flat from 1957 through 2013."

This man, and other people like him, only care about keeping government regulations from effecting their bottom line, with no regard for the future of everybody else.

This argument seems pretty weak. Is he saying that a good indicator that it's not real is that banks & investment firms aren't considering it in their investments? Arent these the same banks & investment firms that needed to be bailed out not so long ago because of the incredibly poor investment decisions they made?

Also, if they look at what's been happening recently, the earth should actually be cooling right now. 

Based on the combination of decreased solar activity, a steady El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and a declining Pacific Decadal Oscillation over the last 30 years, we would expect to be experiencing a cooling climate. However, despite this opposition from multiple natural factors, global temperatures have risen throughout this time period as the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has escalated.

"Karl Barbosa","2018-01-15T17:45:53Z","HIs logic is fundamentally flawed, though. Banks, as proven time and time again, including only 10 years ago, are all about sharp short term gain vs long term investment. The housing bubble would never have happened if they planned long term. They are a business and hence make business decisions. If they can invest in beach front condos *now* and sell them *now*, their investment is secure as it's the condo owners that will pay the price, not the banks these condos were purchased from. To be blunt, businesses will lie to get business if no one call them out on that lie right away. That's how business works. It's an calculated gamble.

Now on the other side of that coin, you have climate scientists. There's no profit to be made in science unless you're some sort of celebrity. There's no direct profit to be made at all other than getting funding for your field of research so as to keep you in your line of work. Also, the very nature of science means it's nearly impossible to lie as their studies get peer reviewed, and other scientists looooove finding the flaws in your math, so your calculations have to be very precise. So if the *overwhelming* majority of climate scientists support the idea that man made climate change is real and happening, and have the math and chemistry to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, then it's obvious who you need to believe.

By the way, natural cycles of rising and cooling temperatures either happen over thousands of years ... or as a result of a major natural catastrophe such as a Yellowstone scale volcano erupting. But in our case, temperatures are rising by 2 or 3 degrees in less than a century, with no such epic disasters, and with only the measurable rise in greenhouse gases being a cause.

Sorry folks, Dan Pena is full of shit and it only takes a very basic logic to see that. People who deny climate change, despite all the proof we already have, and in fact have known of for over 50 years, are only doing it due to a personal agenda, either for business reasons, or because of being politically affiliated with a party that also denies it."

"Scott Haynes","2018-01-15T10:50:31Z","Jan 8, 2018 NASA-led study solves a methane puzzle

Methane emissions have been rising sharply since 2006. Different research teams have produced viable estimates for two known sources of the increase: emissions from the oil and gas industry, and microbial production in wet tropical environments like marshes and rice paddies. But when these estimates were added to estimates of other sources, the sum was considerably more than the observed increase. In fact, each new estimate was large enough to explain the whole increase by itself.

Scientist John Worden of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and colleagues focused on fires because they're also changing globally. The area burned each year decreased about 12 percent between the early 2000s and the more recent period of 2007 to 2014, according to a new study using observations by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer satellite instrument. The logical assumption would be that methane emissions from fires have decreased by about the same percentage. Using satellite measurements of methane and carbon monoxide, Worden's team found the real decrease in methane emissions was almost twice as much as that assumption would suggest.

When the research team subtracted this large decrease from the sum of all emissions, the methane budget balanced correctly, with room for both fossil fuel and wetland increases. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications."

"Andrew Campbell","2018-01-15T09:00:44Z","The question to climate change deniers should be as follows: Is climate change only ever a natural event or is it possible that human activity can cause climate change? 'Climate change deniers' seem to fall into two categories. The first category is simply the one where they say climate change only ever has natural causes and the second category is where they admit that human activity can cause climate change but isn't causing climate change at the moment.

So for the first group you ask what are the natural causes for the rise in atmospheric co2. For the second group you ask if human activity contributes to a rise in atmospheric co2 and how much has that rise been. They may come up with some nonsense about sun activity and so on but this is easily debunked.

After this you present a timeline of co2 increases and talk about the effects on the environment of increased co2. Then when they point out what they think is an anomaly in the data you point out that the data is remarkably clear that over a period of a number of years co2 in the atmosphere has dramatically increased. 

They still won't believe you because they distrust rational arguments and take pleasure from 'intuiting', and so you will need to point out that history shows the danger of adopting a laissez-faire attitude to environmental catastrophe. You can point them to the Irish famine where over a million starved to death due to the British governments belief that the markets would provide.

They still won't believe you, but instead of withdrawing and saying nothing, history will show that there were a few good people."

He needs to learn the difference between the underlying Milankovitch Cycles and the contrary direction temperatures are currently going. It would be useful if he learnt of the keystone nature CO2 has and developed an understanding of the various CO2 cycles and how the various positive feedback systems can lead to a runaway warming which is both likely and perilous, indeed it may have already began. 

Finally to put ones faith in the judgement of the same people who caused the 2008 financial crisis with their sub-prime investments and created banks too big to fail but also too big to bail.

Besides being incredibly rude, his arguments do not come packages with any facts or data in support or against climate change. 

The global climate DOES change in cycles. It gets warmer and hotter over very long periods of time. Insulation means it takes another long period of time before the climate starts changing again. 

The recent increases in temperature are abrupt and begin shortly after the industrial revolution. Some years are colder than others but if you average its an ever increasing variable. 

Why should we care what the blood sucking banks who keep perpetuating this boom bust cycle and getting rich off of buying the bankrupt real estate of hard workers in the US? The banks benefit because climate change is a long term problem in an economical framework and banks and businesses are completely zoned in on padding quarterly earnings. 

Science is the best way of filtering out human biases such as corporate greed to describe the actual hidden truths of the universe. You can be on your way to becoming an expert in the global warming debate by applying for Chemistry, Biology, Geology, and astronomy 101 at your local community college.

""It's cyclical"" - When climate-change deniers hear that the earth has always had a warming and cooling cycle, they stop thinking.¬† So here are some questions to think about... What causes the cycle? How long does the cycle usually take? How long has the most recent cycle taken?¬† Might this be a problem? (Think about it in more detail, not like a child)
""10 to 100 feet in the next 30 or 40 yrs!"" - Climate science deniers (and the media) love to exaggerate the claims made by researchers.¬† The most recent NOAA data states that by 2100 (80 yrs or so), sea levels will rise between 8 in (0.2m) and 8 ft (2.5m).
""Banks wouldn't finance properties if global climate change was true"" - First, banks/lenders are notorious for their short-sightedness.¬† They assume they will hold the debt for less than two years, so who cares about the long term prospects.¬† This is what gave us the mortgage crash of 2008.¬† We do know that insurance companies are recommending flood policies for homes that were never before considered at flood risk.Our current global climate is changing due to human activity.¬† You will not find a single scientist who disputes that.¬† The degree to which this will be catastrophic or not is debatable, but titles like ""Global Warming is a Fraud"" simply show the ignorance of the one posting."

I've seen the work over at Adapt2030 and it's pretty compelling. Then I found Dane Wiggington, a full global warming proponent, and again, compelling argument. result ... I'm more confused than ever. But, nature is a bunch of intertwined cycles and I'm bloody cold in summer..... so yeah, likely global cooling is truth. Also CO2, a trace and important gas will fluctuate and lags temperature not the other way around. 

There is a lot of disinformation, what a minefield....  but yeah... the last 2 summers have been lame and the last 2 winters have dragged on for longer. peace to you all."

Twenty years later and people are still just finding out that Global Warming was a huge, ugly hoax ?  It is beyond me how they kept up this stupid front for twenty years.  I fear we, the people, are simply not in the habit of employing ordinary skepticism.  Meantime, we have been ignoring (1) a rapid Species Mass Extinction well advanced (The Sixth), and (2) the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum which suggests twenty or thirty years of much colder temperatures.

2. Its probably now too late to prevent devastating change over the next 70yrs.
3. Dan Pena is an idiot with plenty of vested interest in doing as he does.
4. These warmer and cooler periods over the last 3 million years were all caused by natural forcings, i.e. solar changes, orbital variances etc. We understand these extremely well today and have been able to discount them as the driver of our current rapid climate change.

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 120ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

The only way it can be a scam is if you decide the laws of physics are wrong. At which point I would question your sanity, not your knowledge.

Climate directly affects CO2 levels, not the opposite, (as is claimed).  Factually, based on true scientific evidence, we are on the cusp of a period of global cooling, and any warming recently witnessed is merely a ""blip"" used in error as ""evidence"" for anthropogenic climate change.   Cloud cover is the main culprit, not water vapour and not CO2.  The fact that ""global warming""  was changed in title to ""climate change"" ought to immediately give the game away to any moderately intelligent being.  The factors affecting our climate are way too complex to be open to direct interpretation via computer modelling.  Solar activity, cloud cover, asymmetry of the earth, cyclical phenomena all play a part and the interactions are highly complex and unpredictable.  To claim that a paltry 2% increase in CO2 levels, as caused by human activity has a catastrophic effect on climate, when that 2% is actually only 2% of the current maximum of 400 parts per million of CO2 in the entire atmosphere is simply ludicrous, as it amounts to only a 0.000008%  atmospheric increase if one properly does the maths.

"Robert Carver","2018-01-14T09:58:02Z","I have a better explanation, even though I like Dan's. When was the thermometer invented? 1870s. When did they start recording temperatures, not just reading the ice cores, because those are only plus or minus three degrees accurate and only sample a tiny percentage of the planet. First temperature records go back to the 1930s when the thermograph was invented, based upon the tickertape machines of the stock market. Before that, nobody was recording the temperature 24/7. They might have recorded once a day, but that is worthless. And even with a thermograph, that creates huge amounts of data that usually varies by up to 30 degrees in one location. All the thermographs since the 1930s have only sampled 1% of the planet, and 40% of those have been located in the US, so the rest of the world is purely a guess. Nobody recorded the temperatures of the oceans until two years ago. So when did they actually start recording the global temperatures, with any degree of accuracy? Do you know? 1979 was the first satellite that sensed that. So guess what, we have a sum total of 39 years of accurate¬† temperature records. Everything else is just¬†a guess, and the degree of accuracy of the other data is again, plus or minus two to three degrees. So how much has the temperature changed since 1979? Do you really know? What does the raw data show? Nothing, it shows nothing, absolutely zero change, in the last 39 years. Only by manipulating the data can you show any change. So what the fuck are they talking about? Sure, I believe the climate changes, but we know nothing, we have no clue why, and only after spending $20B a year for thirty years now do we know that it is definitely not CO2. Oh, BTW, the sea level has not risen even a tenth of an inch since we have been measuring it. All the changes have been solely because of the natural rise and fall of the land, like Miami. The parts of Miami and Boston getting higher sea levels are the parts built on swamp land. The land is sinking, naturally. We need to put Al Gore against a wall and shoot that asshole."

Do you mean the banks yielded some world wide dominance over climate science?

A double hurdle: 
First they had to gain absolute control over every single government.
And then the governments had to give strict orders to their scientists to produce fake data.
Because all science is interconnected all scientists, not only climatologists and all universities including all students had to be gagged. A task as monumental as claiming that all fossils in the world were fakes.
Does not sound very likely to me.

And now to the main point: What would ""the banks"" get out of it? How would ""the banks"" profit from a transition from coal and gas to renewable energy or from gasoline powered cars to electric cars? And why would ""the banks"" not simply choose to divest from fossil fuels and invest into renewables? They do have the power to pull the rug right under big oil if they wanted it so.

And then have a closer look at the people who are actually denying climate change:
Are these idealistic young people ready to go to jail for their convictions? Are these rebels against the corrupt establishment? I only see journalists on populistic news channels like FOX rant against global warming, trying to mock and discredit scientists in the worst possible manner. I see politicians who got elected with the help of fossil fuel money saying very silly things about climate change. And I read articles claiming that it was un-american not to stick with oil and gas.

What do you make of that?
And please tell me you have more information about this ""the banks own the wheather"" hypothesis than just that specific assertion. What would people think of you if that's all you have got?"
"Helen of Troy","2018-02-13T02:21:04Z","DD - the bankers own the weather...wake up ducky."
"Donald Duck","2018-02-12T18:25:46Z",">> The bankers have contracted out the best climate scientists in the world to get the truth. 
Who in the world are the ""bankers""? Why would banks contract climatologists? As far as I know this group of scientists usually works for governments. And to the contrary of ""scientists"" hired by fossil fuel companies to deny climate change, their results come from scientific research.

It seems to me that there is a world wide war going on between fossil fuel interests and the people. For the first time in a century people have the chance to free themselves from the tyranny of big oil and OPEC and open the way for a healthier and more sustainable way of life.

Big oil is going. It's going kicking and screeming - but it's going. And all the lies about global warming not happening and the ""dirty secrets"" of clean energy are not going to help them. Because for the first time in history the bare naked economics are against fossil fuels - clean energy is now cheaper than heavily subsidized dirty energy not even counting the costs to the environment caused by fossil fuels."
"Bo Rood","2018-01-15T16:14:38Z","Eric Faassen What? LMAO! The organism still has to change according to you nutjobs. For your story to be true billions upon billions of fish had to have spontaneously jumped out of the oceans and started breathing air then began a process of transmorphing into a variety of land creatures, which would include insects, so do you called that de-evolution? LoL. 

Get that stupidity out of your head! You make people cringe. It's embarrassment to listen to you people wasting your minds."
"Eric Faassen","2018-01-15T12:24:04Z","Bo Rood this comment shows you deeply misunderstand thr theory of evolution. The 'unit' of evolution is not the organism, as you assume, but the gene. Thinking from the gene instead of the organism solves all your 'problems'. One celled organisms with genes that drive them to co√∂perate with other cells will create clusters of cells that slowly evolve to be one being. No species has ever been found in a mid-stage of evolution because it is not the organism that is slowly evolving, but its genes, and a change in genes does not always constitute a change in fenotype. Also don't forget that evolution is a painstakingly long proces that relies on faulty copying of genes, something that cannot easily be demonstrated in a laboratorium (although it has been done with fruit flies, this is one of the longest experiments ever set up).

If you cannot offer an alternative theory that has the same level of empirical adequaty, you can not discard the theory of evolution. Especially not when your 'problems' are pseudo-problems that can be solved by having a proper grasp on the most current new insights concerning evolution."
"Bo Rood","2018-01-15T02:20:49Z","Eric Faassen There is no theory to replace it, because it never had any validity to begin with. It's just an absurd fantasy. As for the origin of life on Earth, scientifically it remains a comp!ete mystery.
A few simple things to remember when someone brings up the evolution farce
1. Single celled organisms do not have any ability to transmorph into multiple celled organisms
2. A species cannot add or subtract chromosomal counts to morph into any other creature
3. In the entire history of fossil discovery there has never been found a single so called transitional creature, connecting two different species
4. There has never been any occurrence of any creature morphing into a different species. (Every actual biological process is routinely duplicated in labs every week)"
"Eric Faassen","2018-01-15T01:43:52Z","Bo Rood then I'm extremely keen to know what theory replaced it. Remember all the criteria it has to fit to be scientific in nature; highly empirical adequate and highly falsifiable whilst solving (almost non-existent) problems unsolvable for the theory of evolution.

Heads up: the ""watchmaker's argument"" for creation does not hold."

I found the 2013 article by NASA you're referencing. What a complete misrepresentation of the information you have tried to feed people. 

The CO2 in the atmosphere doesn't ""cool"" the earth. It shields the earth from a rapid rise in temperature from strong solar heat. It's like shielding yourself from fire with a fire retardant blanket. You'll still warm slowly from the fire, but the blanket would deflect most of the heat away, keeping you relatively ""cool"" in that environment."
"Taylor D","2018-01-24T10:52:21Z","Vex T 
CO2 has been demonstrated to absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. 

Your story about the NASA article is partially untrue and misleading. The article was not retracted and it is about a particular part of Antarctica. Quote, ""When the team looked at the overall balance between the radiation upward from the surface of the ice sheet and the radiation both upward and downward from the upper levels of the atmosphere across all infrared wavelengths over the course of a year, they found that in central Antarctica the surface and lower atmosphere, against expectation, actually loses more energy to space if the air contains greenhouse gases, the researchers report online and in a forthcoming Geophysical Research Letters."""

People die because of pollution, hundreds die every day in China, but not here. So with a higher CO2 level, the plants get greener, they produce more food. I guess the harm is obesity, but tell that to a starving child in India. So warmer might mean rising sea levels, but that is a lie, they have not risen at all. Warmer seas produce more coral, more undersea life, deserts shrink, and polar bears thrive. So I am at a loss, who is harmed by global warming? Nobody.

"Tengooda","2018-01-13T23:27:42Z","The guy wearing the red tie only exceeds his foul language with his ignorance about climate issues. 
To take just his first point where he claims a scientist in Antarctica told (from ice core evidence) him ""the world fifty five thousand years ago was two degrees warmer Celsius than it is today"". He then went on to refer to ""the 13.8 billion years we have been on this planet"".
Both of those statements are false, and are easily shown to be so.
Here is the graph of Antarctic temperature and CO2 from the well known Vostok ice core:
http://www.euanmearns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vostok_temperature_co2.png
As you can see, the temperature in Antarctica 55,000 years ago was about 4 to 5degC COLDER than at present, which translates to about 2degC colder than at present globally (temperature changes in Antarctica are about double those of the global average).
And, of course, it is the Universe that is 13.8 billion years old, The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and we have only been on it for a few hundred thousand years.
Would you not think that someone who had been asked to sit on a stage and give his opinions on this subject might have checked his information instead of making a fool of himself by talking such nonsense?

There was a time, the Eemian interglacial, about 125,000 years ago when global temperatures were slightly warmer than the present, though we will exceed them this century unless we are very careful. But as a consequence of that warming spike, sea levels rose between 6 and 9 metres, and there is evidence of storms the ferocity of which is beyond our experience - they hurled boulders weighing more than a thousand tonnes well above sea level, see;
http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/megastorms-that-can-throw-thousand-tonne-boulders-up-cliffs-may-be-on-their-way-back-thanks-to-a6754511.html
The Eemian stands as a warning of what will happen if we do nothing. It is not a source of complacency for rich fools, or anyone else."

But that's so typical, and it is largely because of this that people with differing views cannot have an intelligent discussion anymore.  
The left often characterizes doubt about the validity of global warming as a rejection of scientific principle,  as that furthers their aim in vilifying all conservatives en masse.  I can say that it's far more complex than that.  Americans have seen 'science' used to justify rather specious aims for a well over a century (does anyone remember phrenology?), and there have been many conflicting views put forward on the subject of global warming, as well as predictions that simply haven't materialized (Miami is still above water, I believe).  It's actually the mix of 'science' (which, to my mind, includes pseudo-science), political agendas, and media distortion to further a dubious goal that most conservatives so distrust.  Like many others, I have no problem with science per se; as I recall, I made straight 'A's in those subjects in school..."

So they do what they have to do and pretend to deny climate change.
But besides that pretty much everyone agrees. The question is not if man made climate change is a thing or not. The question is when it will be, how big it will be, how much we actually contribute to it and what we are willed to do about it. People who used to pretend to deny climate change do not appreciate the direction this debate is heading and therefore switched over to try to influence it by argueing that climate change may very well be a positive thing... grasping for straws.

The earth isn't 13.8 billion years old (thats the universe) the earth is 4.56 billion years old. And we humans haven't been on the planet for anywhere near 13.8 billion years lol (modern humans have been around for about 250 to 300 thousand years) and the planet isn't miserable. And there are banks in Miami that have been denying 30 year mortgages to low lying costal property. And Al Gore didnt come up with climate change, scientists discovered it over a hundred years ago.

"BigNewGames","2018-01-12T16:54:17Z","First of all, I have no interests or ties to the oil industry. I am retired with a science degree in 3D CADD, architecture and engineering. I now study science as a hobby. Global Warming is caused by the sun. It has nothing to do with the CO2 gas concentrated near the ground in our atmosphere. Let me show you the evidence.

If temperatures rise by the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere then it would be apparent in the CO2 levels in the summer compared to the winter right? Meaning the CO2 levels in the atmosphere should be higher in the summer than in the winter, that's when it is hot out right?

Near the end of the summer, when temperatures are hot, in August, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere on average in the northern hemisphere are round 150 ppmpv. Extremely low! At the end of winter, before spring, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere on average are around 400 ppmpv. So as the Earth heats up, from spring to summer the CO2 levels in the atmosphere slowly dwindle till August when the CO2 levels are around 150 ppmpv. This is because plants absorb CO2 and use the carbon molecules for food. So at the end of summer the plants that have been growing all summer absorbed most of the CO2 from the atmosphere. 

The picture this paints is that by reducing the CO2 levels in the atmosphere causes the temperatures on our planet in the northern hemisphere to increase. But the CO2 levels increase during the winter because it is cold outside and plants go dormant, no longer using the CO2 for food. This is not evidence that CO2 is causing climate change! 

When we address the seasonal tilt of the Earth's axis in respect to the sun causes this notion of CO2 being the cause of climate change to fail miserably. When we use the sun's energy output as a variable it clearly shows us that climate change is caused by the sun, not because of humans nor because of CO2 gas concentrated near the ground in the atmosphere. No blanketing effect! No greenhouse effect, nothing!

March 5th and 6th of 2012 the sun unleashed a string solar flares, I believe around 11 of them, aimed right at Earth, the biggest one was a class X5.4 flare. The average temperature in March where I live is around 32¬∞ F. March 18th 2012 at the Traverse City Airport the temperature peaked at around 82¬∞ F. Clearly sun had everything to do with the temperature spike occurring for about 2 weeks in March of 2012! CO2 levels in the atmosphere had nothing to do with the temperature spiking like that!

Climate change is real, but it is all because of nature, not man! PEACE."

Following is an excerpt from NASA?: 
The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year ‚Äî from January through September, with the exception of June ‚Äî were the warmest on record for those respective months. 

Climate does vary from year to year and its effects are experienced according to location, but the Average Global Temperature has risen steadily and the corresponding climate changes we are observing Worldwide are showing exactly what we have to look forward to.  

If you think that you've seen powerful Hurricanes, Cyclones, Tornadoes, Lightning and Thunder Storms, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET . . . but stay tuned, you will.

-UAH satellite temperatures have risen 0.13 per decade since observations started in 1979 but not much of that warming has happened since 1998. If not for the PDO event last year the trend would would be down. 

So if CO2 is rising where is the warming? 

-UN IPCC CMIP5 models are predicting much more warming than is observed. The models ... the ones our government are relying on ... are profoundly wrong. 

The earth radiates heat. All of the heat in the CO2 absorption spectrum is already saturated.

The 'Greenhouse' effect of increased CO2 since 1958 is approximately 1.7 W/m^2. Given the average TSI is 1361 W/m^2 ... changes in solar flux are much more likely to cause climate change than is heat flux radiated towards earth from atmospheric CO2.

The universe is 13.8 billion years old and the human race is only about 200,000 years old. If the age of the universe was a one year calendar, then human life has only been around for the last minute of December 31st on the calendar. If that's the scale you're going to use then anything we do to each other is Justified do do it's Cosmic insignificance. We could literally wipe out all the species on the planet and it doesn't matter.

If however, you believe in measuring the significance of things based on how we really feel about their impact on our day-to-day lives, as well as the lives of other human beings, then anthropogenic climate change is extremely significant. Florida is already experiencing the effects of sea level rise, as evidenced by their infrastructure projects to mitigate the damage of higher tides by raising their roads.

If global warming is so bad, banks won't make shitty loans to Miami building projects? That's his fucking argument?

US banks made $trillions of dollars in shitty loans leading up to the mortgage crisis in 2008. If they've made profoundly shitty loans before, I wouldn't put it past them for making shitty loans in the future.

FUCK, as tax payers we've told irresponsible fucks that they can make as many irresponsible loans as possible, and we'll always bail them out because they're ""too big to fail"".

Hell they made shitty loans in the Savings and Loans Crisis. If anything, Wallstreet has a TRACK record, of making SHITTY LOANS. Not to mention all the shitty loans that lead up to the Great Depression, bank foreclosures by the thousands.

 Seriously, the people making those loans probably make a commission on the loan they made. They don't give a fuck if the property will be worthless with a smidge of sea level rise just like before with the mortgage bubble.

it absolutely will just look at the warmest period in earths entire history since life evolved called the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum. not that we can expect even a fraction of that warming especially considering ive brought up the fact that temperatures have in fact leveled out already which you conveniently ignored. ocean life suffered somewhat especially near the equator, however, terrestrial animals thrived and its actually thought to have been what allowed for our primate ancestors to evolve in the huge tropical rain forests of canada and siberia. yes some areas will experience drought but some will experience humidity. it almost perfectly balances itself out your response in no way proves that warming is mostly bad. explain how our economy is ""dependent"" on current conditions? half of america will have a longer growing season and plants will grow bigger and faster under higher co2 if anything it will help the economy. SOME species of plants dont like high co2 but MOST plants do thrive under prolonged co2 concentrations of around 2,000 ppm, any good grower knows this.

_""The way of life for people in the Northern hemisphere will be damaged no differently than those at the equator. The foundation of our economy is the current environment. Your argument that the good changes cancel out the bad changes is another common myth. You're telling me shit I already know acting like you're educating me, so listen and take off tin foil hat.""_     again how old are you? seriously? you have to back up what you are saying like i have otherwise you are just making baseless claims. if everyone were like you all debates would just devolve into ""ya-huh"" ""nuh-uh"" ""ya-huh"" ""nuh-uh"" 

again its not the co2 thats at dangerous levels its the lack in oxygen lol do you know how breathing works? we breathe in oxygen, and exhale co2, it doesnt matter how high co2 is as long there is also enough oxygen to breathe. the fact that i had to tell you this is embarrassing, you are no more intellectual than a common AGW denier.

you get one last chance to comprehensively refute my points, you know, like you do in a debate?

1. temperatures have already leveled out since the last grand solar maximum. heading into the next glacial maximum co2 levels will drop by as much as 250 ppm (2.5 times the amount we are responsible for) for 100,000+ years. much if not most of the warming can be explained with solar activity especially considering that the modern maximums solar activity is greater than that of the medieval warming period. 

2. co2 is at all time lows, vegetation and mega fauna are thus struggling to survive and now the only large animals left are either in africa the warmest place on earth or have made some amazing adaptions to the cold and insufficient plant life.

3. the last thermal maximum called the eemian interglacial saw co2 levels as high as 320 ppm, meaning at the VERY most we will only be slightly warmer than the warmest period of an ICE AGE. 400 ppm does not cause runaway greenhouse effect, not even with 9,000 ppm no plant life and no ozone layer does runaway greenhouse effect occur.

and remember, insulting me and making baseless claims is not debating. if you really want to prove me wrong (or if you could) you would quote and cite data like ive been doing, AND unlike you i will directly consider those points in my next response or concede the argument if i am indeed wrong. the fact that i have to keep restating my points is completely ridiculous whats the point in trying to educate you if you ignore my most compelling points? its like you are hoping that i wont notice and just forget about the points that you cant refute. you are arguing like a child and if this were an actual moderated debate the crowd would be laughing at you."

I'm aware of the positive side effects that could be caused by global warming as I did say some species would benefit. The rate of change we're experiencing now is similar to that of mass extinction events in the past. The forests need rainfall just as much as it needs co2. Plants cannot live on co2 alone. CO2 enhanced plants will need extra water both to maintain their larger growth as well as to compensate for greater moisture evaporation as the heat increases. Too high a¬†concentration of CO2 causes¬†a reduction¬†of photosynthesis in¬†certain of plants. There is also evidence from the past of major damage to a wide variety of plants species from a sudden rise in CO2. Some plants exhibit a brief and promising burst of growth upon initial exposure to C02, effects such as the nitrogen plateau¬†soon shorten this benefit.

The way of life for people in the Northern hemisphere will be damaged no differently than those at the equator. The foundation of our economy is the current environment. Your argument that the good changes cancel out the bad changes is another common myth. You're telling me shit I already know acting like you're educating me, so listen and take off tin foil hat.  

Yeah, try putting a plastic bag full of co2 around your head and start breathing, then tell me that co2 can't reach a concentration that's unbreathable. I refuted the high co2 argument already, but since you didn't listen I decided to make fun of your argument and you took it out of context as expected. It isn't difficult to understand. Too much change = bad, which means too much co2 = bad. I already explained why, but you don't care. Making fun of dishonest people is my pleasure. I'm not here to educate people, and neither are you. You're here to misinform people with your misconceptions that you don't even know exist because you're too dumb to recognize being uninformed. I'm here to observe your reaction to my comments, and fix on your reasoning instead of debating already known science."
"Tristun Alekzander","2018-01-17T21:07:10Z","Josef K once again you have made several baseless claims while also ignoring or brushing aside my most compelling points. you are beginning to annoy me.

_""Yeah go figure, your argument is the same as before and you've added another myth. ""The Earth has experienced much higher co2 levels in the past therefore we will be fine"" is essentially the argument. Take off the tinfoil hat and be honest with yourself.""_ is this seriously how you debate? how old are you? 

_""Asking questions is an important stage of recognizing your own confusion. Although they seem awfully similar to, ""are you claiming humans evolved when there are still monkeys?"" Good questions need to be directed towards oneself.""_ what are you even going on about? are you trying to get me to just shut up? so far it really seems like its you that should be asking me questions yet you obviously lack the humility and dont seem to recognize a debate when you are in one.

_""An honest person wouldn't come to me for credible answers anyways. You're here for other reasons that don't involve learning, like spreading your false wisdom. The question you're conveniently ignoring is how the medieval warm period correlates to the warming we're experiencing now and it doesn't. Natural factors show that we should have been cooling a half a century ago but you're jumping to conclusions as if it's the same trend with the same causes.""_ no im here to educate just like you im not only arguing with deniers but alarmists like yourself. actually the grand solar maximum was in 1959, the last time that happened was in the middle ages 1,000 years ago during the medieval warming period. there was a second smaller peak in 1996 and since 1996 temperatures have gradually slowed down. temperatures wont actually start ""cooling"" until about 2030-2045 after the Modern Maximum has come to an end. temperatures follow closely behind solar activity, geologically speaking its an almost instant correlation but in the span of  just a few decades all you are going to observe is a decreased rate of warming and thats exactly what we see. it took 1,000 years for solar activity and temperature to reach its peak again and you think in about 60 years at the most 20 years at the least there should be instant cooling? there shouldnt and on top of the fact that there is 100ppm of extra co2 perfectly explains the delay. again you would have to be claiming that the solar maximum just skipped us this time. there is an almost perfect correlation between solar activity and temperature, i say ""almost"" because the small 100 ppm of carbon weve added explains the rest perfectly. 

_""A runaway greenhouse effect does not imply that we'll experience the same consequence as Venus. Apparently boiling the oceans is only possible if we release 10 times more CO2 than we currently do. The greenhouse effect begins with trapping heat. Feedback mechanisms increases its strength thereby amplifying the already rising temperatures.""_ if you had any humility and objectivity you would have just conceded that no: 400 ppm does NOT cause runaway greenhouse effect. yet you find it neccessary to try and prove to me that you know things. 

temperatures will not only level out but go back down just as theyve done time and time again and from much higher co2 levels. yes and how will we deal with the millions of acres of fertile land opened up in the siberia and canada, how will our economies deal with a longer growing season? how will millions of species of animal deal with losing less energy to the cold? how will the amazon (which is currently starved of co2) deal with more co2? how will earths vegetation deal with increased rate of growth and reproduction? how will earths humans and other animals deal with more food? thats ignoring the fact that we are heading back into a glacial period and that probably wont happen anyway.

4,000 ppm is rather high and i was trying to make it easy for you to refute it but you cant even do that. carbon content is not necessarily a sign of breathability, that would be the oxygen content. and usually the more co2 our plants have the more oxygen they give off. for instance if you were to sleep with your blankets covering your face (which i find unbearable but my sister actually commonly sleeps like that) you would be breathing very very high co2 concentrations all night yet its hardly noticeable isnt it? (besides the uncomfortable heat and humidity of your breathe you certainly dont feel like you are running out of air even under very high co2 and very low oxygen).

co2 is at all time lows, vegetation and mega fauna are thus struggling to survive and now the only large animals left are either in africa the warmest place on earth or have made some amazing adaptions to the cold and insufficient plant life.

in the transition into glacial periods co2 levels drop by as much as 250 ppm, this is 2.5 times the amount we are responsible for. explain to me exactly why this isnt going to happen as it always does? you would have to claim that 400ppm causes runaway greenhouse effect which i think youve conceded that it certainly does not in your own way.

and considering that the last thermal maximum called the eemian interglacial saw co2 levels of 320ppm we know for sure that it will level out at a point that is only slightly warmer than the warmest period of an ice age. still relatively cold compared to the rest of earths history of which life has evolved to survive under. again thats ignoring the fact that co2 levels will drop naturally by 250 ppm over the next thousand years or so and all the oil in the world was only able to add 100 ppm as its virtually depleted."

Chaos theory has to do with the weather. Your arguments are equivalent to arguments against other prominent and successful theories that creationist would use. "" we don't know everything therefore I can assume what I want"" is basically what you're saying. Poor logic on your end. Sad that I'm engaging with another tin foil hat. I notice that the only way to persuade stubborn people is to be around them for months. Which is sad because you'll be running away so soon.

""It is very easy to follow science. I do. ""

Sure, sure... Totally believable. You're acting like a scientists and not like all of the other tinfoil hats in the comments. You're special! I wonder what science you follow and how you able to read the difficult terminology in the scientific literature. Notice how I don't ask questions because I can make an educated guess that you're a bullshiter. I'd bet all my money on this assumption if I could. Man I would make millions. You're the kind of person who copies and pastes things without understanding the meaning behind them. Such as:
""We do not have to agree on the results of any scientific findings, in fact, everything is up for debate. That IS science. But the fabric of science is the only thing we do have to agree on. And i do.""

This is actually complete guess work by you. The most important part of science is called being informed. Debate is only efficient if done by experts with other experts. What you agree on should be the data, if you know the data, the overall picture will be clear which is why roughly 97% of the research supports AGW. The problem with AGW deniers is that they don't agree on a single reason for not believing in global warming. As long as the misinformation they use dismisses AGW, their reasons can all contradict one another. This isn't how science is done.

 ""nature is still much more powerful than we are, so we should go where it takes us.""

mmk not sure what that vague comment means.

""the warming as is, if there is any, is called weather. Not climate.""

Ohhh... Can we just clear this up first. Weather and climate are not the same. This claim is based more on an appeal to emotion than fact. The inference is that climate predictions, decades into the future, cannot be possibly right when the weather forecast for the next day has some uncertainty. In spite of the claim in this myth, short term weather forecasts are highly accurate. However, slight errors in initial conditions make a forecast beyond two weeks nearly impossible. Climate models are not predicting day to day weather systems. Instead, they are predicting climate averages. You'll be too afraid to come to terms with reality regardless. I'll need to rewire your brain and that can only be done with time."

2. Its probably now too late to prevent devastating change over the next 70yrs.
3. Dan Pena is an idiot with plenty of vested interest in doing as he does.
4. These warmer and cooler periods over the last 3 million years were all caused by natural forcings, i.e. solar changes, orbital variances etc. We understand these extremely well today and have been able to discount them as the driver of our current rapid climate change.

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 220ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

The only way it can be a scam is if you decide the laws of physics are wrong. At which point I would question your sanity, not your knowledge.

Climate change has always been happening, 7 billion humans do have an effect on it though i.e. it aint too natural anymore. From what I've learned weather patterns are becoming increasingly more sporadic and extreme. Global warming does not mean everywhere gets warm. It means desserts get drier, high rain fall areas get more rain...and so on. More extreme weather events so it might not rain for a month and then it rains for 24h straight. Not good."

CO2 is plant food and NOT a pollutant.  Plants give off Oxygen and people and animals breath in oxygen.  People and animals exhale carbon dioxide and plants take in carbon dioxide.  That's how it works.  If the Greenie Weenies don't want to contribute to CO2 emissions, then they better give up all carbonized beverages because all carbonized soft drinks are made with tons of CO2. There is a CO2 tank at every soft drink fountain in every restaurant.  The ocean levels are not going to rise due to the ice caps melting.  Take a glass and fill it with ice first, then fill it with water and as the ice melts the water did not and will not rise.When you see chunks of ice falling off of an iceberg or a glacier then use your head and think that the ice border has to end somewhere or it would freeze and cover the globe.

Or stable result over and over. We ask questions like could this a, be the cause for b, does c, influence the outcome of a,. So on and so forth. Until we understand what always happens when. . .  So I'd say what happens if you increase the tempetures around the world naturally occurring or due to an abundance of greenhouse gases from the use of fossil fuels. More carbon in atmosphere. Hotter makes it better right. Unless your growing crops. Or baking bread oops now you've burnt it. Or sea lift that cannot tolerate a 2 degree tempeture shift or thermal winds that make cyclonic storms more frequent or severe. Like hurricanes and such.

It‚Äôs actually something the earth hasn‚Äôt experienced in over 800,000 years, possibly 20million years. This is extremely important because increased CO2 leads directly to increased global temperatures. When they talk about the ‚Äúscience being settled‚Äù, this is what they‚Äôre referring to. Increased CO2 leads directly to global warming, that‚Äôs a science fact which has been measured, noted, and replicated in peer reviewed studies. Second thing.......the fact that banks would not loan on property located along the coastline (due to rising seas) reflects his misunderstanding of how mortgage loans work. Banks don‚Äôt hold onto their loans. Once done, a bank will bundle and sell their mortgages to investors as part of a mortgage backed security (MBS). What happens after they sell these mortgages is not their problem. In fact, the entire economic collapse of 2008 and 2009 was based on this scenario. Why would anyone buy a MBS involving flood prone land? Because they aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs in the MBS (just like in 2008). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could rule tomorrow against buying MBS‚Äôs but have not yet done so for political reasons (and possibly greed)."

4. These warmer and cooler periods over the last 3 million years were all caused by natural forcings, i.e. solar changes, orbital variances etc. We understand these extremely well today and have been able to discount them as the driver of our current rapid climate change.

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 220ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

Most of the scientific studies back then concluded that we're heading for global warming. Only few concluded otherwise. Can you refer what study/studies in 1966 said about cooling and who were those scientists? Only 10% of the studies (7 studies) published between 1965-1979 concluded that the world would be cooling and 62% (42 studies) predicted global warming (Peterson, 2008)."

I took an environmental history course and 2 geology classes. It was quite apparent that man made climate change was going to a major issue in our future. Your views on this has about as much credibility as people who believe the earth is flat, or gravity doesn't exist because birds can fly.

Place some ice in a funnel that funnels into a bowl. You can add water to the bowl, mark that as sea level. The land locked ice melts with time, it funnels.into the bowl, the bowl then overflows.

 That's a good household simulation on ice that is land locked dumping into the ocean. Most every major coastal city on earth will be impacted by this.

The fact that your ""experiment"" completely ignores land locked ice melting and dumping into the ocean as ""proof climate change does not exist or won't harm low lying  cities"" makes you a walking indictment of the US educational system."

""There are well-understood physical mechanisms by which changes in the amounts of greenhouse gases cause climate changes. The US National Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society produced a booklet, Climate Change: Evidence and Causes...The booklet discusses the evidence that the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and are still increasing rapidly, that climate change is occurring, and that most of the recent change is almost certainly due to emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activities.
Further climate change is inevitable; if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated, future changes will substantially exceed those that have occurred so far. "" Direct quote from the National Academy of Sciences.

"VJScope","2018-01-17T12:31:47Z","""But the science showing CO2 as a driving force is pretty, uh, forced.""
I don't see anything forced about it. Milankovitch cycles were the trigger of temperature rises in the past and water vapor can only take you so far before it rains back down (and it absorbs different wavelength than CO2), but once the process starts, CO2 starts to drive this positive feedback. Now we are driving that positive feedback by putting extra CO2 into the natural cycle.

""Also, I think the warming, itself, probably peaked at the end of the '90s.""
1998 was unusually warm El Nino year, but 2016 was even warmer El Nino year. 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.

""To me, it's like a bunch of people suddenly discovered climate change""
That may be, but to a scientific community this is over a 100 year old discovery. It just wasn't such an urgent problem 100 years ago. There is even a 60 year old educational film warning us about man made CO2 rise and climate change called 'The Unchained Goddess'.

""To me, there's a lot of questionable science going on"" Yes.. creationists, flat earthers and anti-vaccers say the same thing when they are faced with science that challenges their views.. What I'm wondering is: What makes you different from them?"
"Harry Mills","2018-01-17T01:56:36Z","CO2 is one of the weakest of all greenhouse gases, for starters.  But it is tied to output of other greenhouse gases, so it makes sense to track it.  But the science showing CO2 as a driving force is pretty, uh, forced.  

My issue is mostly with the POLICIES the more hysterical amongst us are advocating. Those policies' main results seem to be to hurt the U.S., who would HONOR the agreements, while other signatories to Paris Accords, like Germany and Japan, are turning back to coal, because the price per kilowatt hour was getting too steep.

I think there are many things that can be done to reduce our footprint on Ma Earth.  But the clowns pushing Global Warming have their own agenda, it would seem.  

Also, I think the warming, itself, probably peaked at the end of the '90s.  Myself, I think much of what's going on is due to the Sun, about which we can do little.  Other planets in the solar system also seem to be showing signs of warming, due to solar activity, but you don't see any coal-fired plants on them.

To me, it's like a bunch of people suddenly discovered climate change, when a 5-yr-old could learn about it on Discovery Channel, from Dinosaur and Ice Age documentaries.  

To me, there's a lot of questionable science going on, and TERRIBLE policy coming out from those who trumpet the science the loudest.   And to oppose them on policy makes you a science-denier, which I most definitely am not."

"blaster 0416","2018-01-16T16:08:30Z","ttmike42   Direct quote from the Royal academy of Sciences and the U.S National Academy of Sciences. 
 ""Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) absorb heat (infrared radiation) emitted from Earth‚Äôs surface. Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of these gases cause Earth to warm by trapping more of this heat. Human activities‚Äîespecially the burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution‚Äîhave increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations by about 40%, with more than half the increase occurring since 1970. Since 1900, the global average surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 ¬∞C (1.4 ¬∞F). This has been accompanied by warming of the ocean, a rise in sea level, a strong decline in Arctic sea ice, and many other associated climate effects. Much of this warming has occurred in the last four decades. Detailed analyses have shown that the warming during this period is mainly a result of the increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Continued emissions of these gases will cause further climate change, including substantial increases in global average surface temperature and important changes in regional climate. The magnitude and timing of these changes will depend on many factors, and slowdowns and accelerations in warming lasting a decade or more will continue to occur. However, long-term climate change over many decades will depend mainly on the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted as a result of human activities.""

"Marin Angeli","2018-01-05T04:51:11Z","Daniel Steven Pe√±a Sr., also known as Dan Pe√±a, is an American philanthropist, businessman and high-performance business coach. He resides at Guthrie Castle in Scotland. Pe√±a is prominent for his eight-day Castle Seminar on his ""Quantum Leap Advantage"" methodology, and claims to have produced $50 billion in equity and value.

Does this pig talk like someone who gives a rat's ass about living things like babies and puppies, whales and forests?  Does his lifestyle imply that he is a compassionate soul who has regard for the miracle of life that is known as Planet Earth?  Since he referred to Earth as a ""miserable planet"" the answer to those questions is obvious.  Don't you know he would lie right to your face just to make more money, and then laugh about how gullible you are?  Isn't that apparent, for all to see?  Lies, for the sake of garnering more wealth, are no less untrue.  
His remark that a scientist told him increasing CO2 may have exacerbated climate change but ""in the cosmos of time, of the 13.8 billion years that we have been on this miserable planet, it's not a fart in the wind."" was pure bullshit.  Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, not 13.8 billion, and modern humans have been present for only about 200,000 years of that time, so he was off by 13,799,800,000 years.  That's thirteen billion, seven hundred and ninety-nine million, eight hundred thousand years.  His point is both vastly inaccurate and desperately moot.  The issue is not about what happened billions of years before the arrival of man‚Ä¶ it is about what is happening now, in the anthropocene.  This guy is spewing so much crap that he looks like a talking toilet.  Of course, the fact that the our biosphere is degrading so rapidly that even Pe√±a will probably survive long enough to witness global environmental cataclysm, is obviously no reason for him to stop selling us all down the river.  
So, why is that, Grasshopper?  Because this person has gone beyond the narcissistic narrative of the self involved elite and embraced full on psychopathy.  He is the face of the evil that is devouring our only home, our beautiful planet.  He seethes with hatred and contempt for the common folk‚Ä¶ as do so many of the, so called, elite (witness the dismissive gesture given toward the questioning woman, by Pe√±a's buddy on stage, when he tells her to sit down‚Ä¶ like he's shooing away some pestering fly, ""be off with you, you're not worth our time"").  When the masses finally get the drift of what the elite have been doing to them for the past 100+ years, people like Pe√±a will be pursued and prosecuted.  I'm guessing lists, of planet eating monsters like him, are already being compiled.  That is a list I would not want my name on‚Ä¶ and a list where I pray that his name is indelibly printed.
If money is your god, then you deserve the hell descending on us all.  The nonhuman innocents of this planet, the layers of life that have given us a safe haven upon which to dwell and grow, they deserve none of it‚Ä¶ but are already suffering and dying in massive numbers.  When they are gone, no matter whether you live in a castle or a hovel, you will follow them into the oblivion brought upon us all by the few, the wealthy, the planet eating elite.
There was, and is, a better way.  Seek it, before it is too late for this planet to continue to support life as we know it.  Balance in nature is the only salvation for Life on Earth.  Life on Earth allows humanity a place to dwell and time to find its spiritual path.  We are not here to grow rich in the banker's eyes, we are here to grow rich in eternal wisdom.  We are here to learn how to live, not how to kill.  We are here to discover how to build up our spirit, not tear down the Earth that supports us.  We are here‚Ä¶ let's not waste this briefest of moments for a handful of gold, an armload of baubles and a castle full of bullshit."

And if you still think that it's CO2 , and human inventions that are causing this then you need to realize that HUMANS THEMSELVES cause the most Co2 production! The only ACTUAL solution to lowering Co2 pollution etc is A FUCKING MASS EXODUS OF HUMAN LIFE! More people = need for more food and live stock. More food / live stock = more Co2. Research how much Co2 live stock produces! There is no magical fucking thing we can do to stop what is happening other then HUNDREDS OF millions of people DIEING. Electric cars??? The Co2 production thats required to build the lithium batteries blows that theory to fuck all. Windmills?? Same shit."

Secondly, this guy is a hopeless romantic. ¬†Take your wife to Antarctica to renew your vows. ¬†Is she the Ice Queen? ¬†To add to this, what did you guys do for fun on your vacation? ¬†You went to listen to some stuffy scientists talk about global warming. ¬†That just warms the heart. ¬†I think grandpa is telling stories again and he's mixing up dreams and things he read in Breitbart with the intercepted Alex Jones messages through his tin foil hat."

While these dammed solar panel makers and climatologists are in cahoots and they have been overpaid and living on the fat of the world for so long and they have used their fat pay cheques to infiltrate the banks and governments!  they even infiltrated the Rothschilds!   Its criminal, we really need to develop a charity for the oil and coal men to survive and fight these solar panel tycoons, we need to teach the oil boys all the dirty tricks that climatologists use as the fossil fuel guys have been caught off guard, the oil men have naively been too moral and unselfish, they have never before had to lobby for their interests for they have been thinking only about how they can serve we the people, not thinking about themselves.  We need to pass around the hat for these poor fossil fuel men so they can save our fossil fuel based economies, our roads and our hummers before this is too late, not to mention our coal miners jobs (after all what coal miner worth his salt would ever retool and retrain to build a wind turbine?) .   And we need to bust up the insurance companies, which are part of the banks, for they are already utilising data on human induced global warming to calculate risk they claim apparently with greater accuracy which they claim allows them to be more competitive.  These insurance companies need to stop being so idealistic and moral and get back to chasing money the old fashion way with fossil fuel on full flow even if the insurance companies find it makes them run at a loss in the future, sometimes you need to run at a loss and take it on the chin like a real man."

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 220ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

The only way it can be a scam is if you decide the laws of physics are wrong. At which point I would question your sanity, not your knowledge.

Coupled with added heat energy storms cause more severe and expensive damage especially to coastal states. And it's all man made. I understand the science so it's easy for me.

"Pal l√§o","2017-12-31T15:56:37Z","For those who are still discussing differences between ""natural climate change"" and ""anthropogenic climate change"":
You do realize that fossil fuels are natural resources and that humans are part of the nature, don't you?
So ""anthropogenic climate change"" is just a sub-category of ""natural climate changes"". Just because we are involved does not mean that the climate change suddenly would not be a ""natural"" climate change anymore. It does not matter if we are the ones who burn fossil fuels or if a lightning causes a huge fire which burns large amounts of fossil fuels, which would be a completely ""humanless"" and therefor undoubted ""natural"" way to end up with the same result --> fossil fuels burned.
Do you really believe the climate ""cares about"" whether the fuels got burned by humans or natural fires? And that the climate then ""decides"" not to be influenced if humans instead of fires were the reason for these emissions?"

I've also read a lot on the internet too. I suppose it's hard to distinguish the difference between frabricated nonsense and science if you don't know how science is done. It's so easy make up anything for people who don't investigate. 

Denialists will always dismiss global warming. They will never agree on why global warming is wrong and their claims contradict each other. One might say that CO2 doesn't have heat trapping properties, the other will say the oceans or volcano's release more co2, and another person will say that the co2 we release is too small of an amount to make a difference or that the energy is absorbed by the oceans and emitted into space. An increase in co2 is good, the effect of co2 is exaggerated, and so on... Now the ocean... Denialist will say that the oceans ph can't change,  the oceans can't absorb co2, sea ice is melting in the arctic but antarctica has gained ice, sea level hasn't risen at all, the sea level rise is an insignificant 1-2mm every year, etc... The commonly regurgitated arguments for historic trends... The Earths climate has always changed, the Earth was much warmer in the past, the medieval warm period was warmer than this, Greenland didn't have an ice sheet when the vikings arrived, trends show that co2 lags behind temperature so co2 doesn't cause higher temperatures.

3. Dan Pena is an idiot with plenty of vested interest in doing as he does.
4. These warmer and cooler periods over the last 3 million years were all caused by natural forcings, i.e. solar changes, orbital variances etc. We understand these extremely well today and have been able to discount them as the driver of our current rapid climate change.

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 220ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

The only way it can be a scam is if you decide the laws of physics are wrong. At which point I would question your sanity, not your knowledge.

Banks cannot make people pay for property that is inhabitable I.e property under water/flooded, so the banks are fucked. Why would banks be investing in properties  that are doomed for rising sea levels? This would effect their investment. Even if you didn't believe that global warming is hoax based on this mere fact. The Financial aspect of half the worlds property effected by rising levels is a BIGGER problem! half the worlds economy would collapse!!how the fuck can you kids not understand this. 
Even if global warming is true (which some of it is) we'd all be to poor to even care!!"

We can look at a cold winter day or even a month and call it evidence, we look at long term data trends to determine climate.  We are losing ice and cost line.

4. These warmer and cooler periods over the last 3 million years were all caused by natural forcings, i.e. solar changes, orbital variances etc. We understand these extremely well today and have been able to discount them as the driver of our current rapid climate change.

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 220ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

The only way it can be a scam is if you decide the laws of physics are wrong. At which point I would question your sanity, not your knowledge.

The lenders and investors are not as concerned with the bricks and mortar as they are with the financial instruments which enable their financial growth. If they can ensure mortgages keep getting raised and investment entities continue to purchase those mortgages, then someone is making bank. It'll only be where those same investors choose not to sink their capital into these types of risks that there will be significant change. Someone will be shorting these investments, buggering off with a huge amount of $$, and the people in the bricks and mortar will be left with $0 value properties, mortgages, and staring down bankruptcy again.

"Alex J","2018-01-12T00:42:30Z","+Robert _ - Exactly. One of the few sensible comments on here. Dan Pena is either an idiot or a charlatan. I'm absolutely convinced he's the latter especially after his Joe Rogan interview. A total psychopath. 

As you've said, humanity has the tendency to kick the can down the road and is always wanting short term gain/profit. Furthermore, very few understand that you can't have perpetual growth in a finite world and even if they did understand, they'd want to ignore it because then they'd have to face the fact that their lifestyle is destructive to the planet. There are number of major problems facing humanity that likely can't be solved without nature forcing those issues on us. They are:

- Many people still want to consume and love materialism;
- We, as a species, have allowed transnational corporations to become far too powerful and pervasive,
- Perhaps most importantly, there are just far too many people on the planet, probably 6 billion too many. During the first 150 years of the industrial revolution, the CO2 present in the atmosphere increased by just under 15ppm. We now see increases of 15ppm every 5 years.

For example, from 1800 to 1900 world population increased by 600 million with an increase of 10 ppm CO2. In the last 27 years alone, world population has increased by 2.3 billion and ppm CO2 has increased by over 50. The correlation between rising ppm CO2 levels and population growth is absolutely incontrovertible. 

Very few have any idea what 800 ppm of CO2 looks like but it's a 3.5 degree increase in worldwide temperature which means that there's only enough arable land to support 1 billion people when there'll be 10+ billion people on the planet. The Earth is going to be a pretty horrific place by the end of the century with ecological and environmental destruction, flooding of all major coastal plains and cities, huge levels of migration, famine & death in the billions and likely cataclysmic resource wars. Countries and corporations will fight over those resources, and the results will be absolutely catastrophic perhaps even nuclear. 

This is a world that will be bequeathed to our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren and there's now very little we can do about it. I‚Äôd be absolutely astonished if there were even a billion people on the planet in 200 years. Kicking the can down the road now means it's unfortunately too late to change the path we're heading down."

Also, if you look in a CO2 gas detector you'll discover that most devices use infrared to detect CO2 concentrations of in the air, and even the US military, when designing heat-seeking missiles, discovered that CO2 in the atmosphere reduced the heat signature of target objects. CO2 absorbs infrared radiation. That's an indisputable fact."

2. Its probably now too late to prevent devastating change over the next 70yrs.
3. Dan Pena is an idiot with plenty of vested interest in doing as he does.
4. These warmer and cooler periods over the last 3 million years were all caused by natural forcings, i.e. solar changes, orbital variances etc. We understand these extremely well today and have been able to discount them as the driver of our current rapid climate change.

5. There are 1500 active volcanoes on earth that add 200 million tons of Co2 to the natural carbon cycle. A cycle which has not gone below 220ppm nor above 350ppm for 3 million years.  

Humanity unnaturally digs up 7 million years worth of stored fossil fuels and burns then every 12 months. 39 BILLION tons of Co2, increasing at half a billion tons per year. The equivalent output of 292,000 volcanoes. We are changing the climate at 170 times the rate of natural variation. No species on earth can adapt to that kind of rate, not even us.

The only way it can be a scam is if you decide the laws of physics are wrong. At which point I would question your sanity, not your knowledge.

Veganism is not the answer, in fact its not very green.   Look at the resources used to maintain similar calorie intake with and without meat and you realise that because meat is more calorie dense less weight is required, less petrol is consumed in delivering it, less packaging, and it is not mutually exclusive (You can graze cows on a field without wiping out the existing wildlife unlike if you plough it and plant cabbages)  Also to quote ""Vegetarians are 'less healthy and have a lower quality of life than meat-eaters', scientists say. Vegetarians are less healthy than meat-eaters, a controversial study has concluded, despite drinking less, smoking less and being more physically active than their carnivorous counterparts."" and that's ignoring the serious mental health issues associated with vegetarianism."

There have been at least fifteen VEI 7 eruptions in the last two hundred thousand years, and at least one in the VEI 8 category during the same period.

Which covers by the way, pretty much the totality of modern Human existence.  

That doesn't include Krakatoa, which constitutes a major part of the Toma supervolcano complex, and last erupted  in 1883.  That eruption may not quite have reached the top of the scale, but it got real damned close.   It pretty much vaporized an island about as large as Guam, along with a massive chunk of limestone seafloor and adjacent reef structure.

Coupla' billion metric tons of carbon right there.  Not to mention, a couple of million tons of sulfur dioxide, which is exponentially more efficient than Co2 in trapping solar radiation.

This planet has seen rocks the size of Mount McKinley come crashing out of the sky - - and those would have been some of the smaller ones.

This planet has seen multiple periods when it was completely covered by ice, pole to equator.  Just as it has seen multiple periods of no ice at all.

There are volcanoes out there with the capacity to pump more shit into the atmosphere in a couple of days, than Humanity has in its entire existence.

The biosphere keeps chugging along just fine, in spite of all that.

The possibility that Human Beings are going to sterilize the planet by means of runaway greenhouse or any other econazi absurdity, is pretty much zero.

It is provable that CO2 absorbed two narrow bands of IR strongly.
BUT:
Do those bands actually cause significant greenhouse effect? Or are factors, such as humidity the primary cause?

does some CO2 induced warming cause large positive feedbacks?

are there negative feedbacks?

What drove temperature changes before human contribution, and can that be accurately be accounted for in the current data set?

Can computer models accurately simulate chaotic systems?

If warming does cause damages, is the damage from returning to a pre-industrial life worse than the damage cause from warming?

Most ""skeptics"" are with what science has been able to prove, the debate is over what has not been proven and falsified repeatedly while still being trotted around in media."

The earth obviously spins like a top, and most everyone knows earth has a slight wobble. With GW melting ice in Greenland and the West Anartic and the East Antarctic acquiring snow pack, the earth's axis is shifting. England is moving towards the Arctic while Japan is moving towards the Equator. The missing key was the cyclic depletion of the underground aquifer in India.  Adhikari and Ivin at JPL did the data crunching. What is key is that an objects spin is most effected at points of 45 degrees. Fascinating as hell. Humans may be effecting the earths climate way beyond GW by itself. We humans might be able to correct for CO2, but the imbalance in the earths spin based on weight distribution, we could never correct for that. The apocalypse may be near."
